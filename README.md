# Personal Website Project

This project is a personal website project that aimed to showcase my projects and share my thoughts.
I will update the website as I build more projects. 

After the basic infrastructure is complete, I will make my website public with the domain https://chenqiwei.org 

P.S. I am not a professional developer, so my code looks like crap, any suggestions will be taken into consideration to improve my code for better understanding for sharing and community use.

## Project Structure

- **Backend**: A Flask server that handles model training and text generation.
- **Frontend**: A React application that provides the user interface.

## Project 1
The first project is simply a generator for shakespeare's text using nanoGPT. Thanks to https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT for the implementation. Credits to him for the nanoGPT code.

The main idea here for training is to first identify all the characters in the Shakespeare's text, then train the model on the characters. 

## Project 2
The second project is a chatbot that uses Deepseek API to simulate a therapy session. Aimming to imitate Jordan Peterson's philosophy in traditional and modern psychology on solving real-world probelms.
