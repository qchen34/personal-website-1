12 more rules for life


To my wife, Tammy Maureen Roberts Peterson, whom I have loved deeply for fifty years, 
and who is admirable, in my estimation, in all regards, and beyond all reason.

A Note from the Author in the Time of 
the Pandemic 


It is a perplexing task to produce a nonfiction book during the global 
crisis brought about by the spread of COVID-19. It seems absurd, in 
some sense, even to think about anything else but that illness 
during this trying time. Nonetheless, binding all the thoughts 
contained in any current work to the existence of the pandemic— 
which too shall pass—seems like an error, as the normal problems 
of life will return at some point (and thankfully) to the forefront. 
That all means that an author of the present day is inevitably going 
to make one mistake (concentrating too much on the pandemic, 
which has an uncertain life span, and producing a book that is 
instantly dated, in consequence) or another (ignoring the pandemic, 
which is very much like failing to attend to the proverbial elephant 
under the rug). 

After considering this, as well as discussing the issues with my 
publishers, I decided to write Beyond Order: 12 More Rules for Life 
according to the plan laid out for it several years ago, and to 
concentrate on addressing issues not specific to the current time 
(thus, to risk the second error rather than the first). I suppose it 
may also be the case that those who have chosen to read this book 
or listen to the audio version might be relieved to turn their 
attention to something other than the coronavirus and the 
devastation it has wrought. 


Overture 


On the fifth of February 2020, I awoke in an intensive care ward in, 
of all places, Moscow. I had six-inch tethers attaching me to the 
sides of the bed because, in my unconscious state, I had been 
agitated enough to try to remove the catheters from my arm and 
leave the ICU. I was confused and frustrated not knowing where I 
was, surrounded by people speaking a foreign language, and in the 
absence of my daughter, Mikhaila, and her husband, Andrey, who 
were restricted to short visiting hours and did not have permission 
to be there with me at my moment of wakening. I was angry, too, 
about being there, and lunged at my daughter when she did visit 
several hours later. I felt betrayed, although that was the furthest 
from the truth. People had been attending to my various needs with 
great diligence, and in the wake of the tremendous logistic 
challenges that come about from seeking medical care in a truly 
foreign country. I do not have any memory of anything that 
happened to me during the most recent weeks preceding that, and 
very little between that moment and my having entered a hospital 
in Toronto, in mid-December. One of the few things I could recall, 
looking back to the earliest days of the year, was the time I had 
spent writing this book. 

I wrote much and edited almost all of Beyond Order during a 
time when my family was plagued by sequential and overlapping 
bouts of seriously impaired health, much of which was the subject 
of public discussion, and for that reason requires some detailed 
explanation. First, in January 2019, Mikhaila had to seek out a 
surgeon to replace much of her artificial ankle, implanted about a 
decade earlier, as the initial installation was never perfect, causing 
her serious pain and trouble with movement as a consequence, and 


then came near to failing. I spent a week with her at a hospital in 
Zurich, Switzerland, for the week of that procedure and her initial 
recovery. 

At the beginning of March, my wife, Tammy, underwent routine 
surgery in Toronto for a common and eminently treatable kidney 
cancer. A month and a half after that surgery, which involved the 
removal of one third of the organ in question, we learned that she 
was actually suffering from an extremely rare malignancy, which 
had a one-year fatality rate of close to 100 percent. 

Two weeks later, the surgeons involved in her care removed the 
remaining two thirds of her afflicted kidney, along with a 
substantial proportion of the related abdominal lymphatic system. 
The surgery appeared to bring the progression of the cancer to a 
halt, but produced leakage of fluid (up to four liters, or one gallon, a 
day) from her now-damaged lymphatic system—a condition known 
as chylous ascites—which rivaled the original condition in danger. 
We journeyed to see a medical team in Philadelphia, where within 
ninety-six hours of the initial injection of a poppy seed oil dye, 
whose practical purpose was the enhancement of images derived 
from CAT or MRI scans, the complete cessation of Tammy’s fluid 
loss was achieved. This breakthrough occurred on the very day of 
our thirtieth wedding anniversary. She recovered rapidly and, to all 
appearances, completely—a testament to the luck without which 
none of us can live, and to her own admirable strength and 
resistance. 

Unfortunately, while these events unfolded, my health fell apart. 
I had begun to take an antianxiety agent at the beginning of 2017, 
after suffering from what appeared to be an autoimmune reaction to 
something I had consumed during the Christmas holiday period of 
2016.* The food reaction made me acutely and continually anxious, 
as well as freezing cold, no matter what clothes I was wearing or 
how many blankets I layered upon myself. Further, it lowered my 
blood pressure so dramatically that whenever I tried to stand I 
would gray out and be forced into a crouch half a dozen or more 
times before trying again. I also experienced insomnia that appeared 
near total. My family physician prescribed a benzodiazepine as well 


as a drug for sleeping. I took the latter a mere handful of times 
before ceasing its use entirely; the terrible symptoms I was 
experiencing, including the insomnia, were almost immediately and 
entirely eradicated by the benzodiazepine treatment, making the 
sleep agent unnecessary. I continued the benzodiazepine for almost 
exactly three years, because my life did seem unnaturally stressful 
during that time (the period when my life changed from the quiet 
existence of a university professor and clinician to the tumultuous 
reality of a public figure), and because I believed that this drug was 
—as is often claimed of benzodiazepines—a relatively harmless 
substance. 

Things changed, however, in March 2019, at the onset of my 
wife’s medical battle. My anxiety spiked noticeably after Mikhaila’s 
aforementioned hospitalization, surgery, and recovery. In 
consequence, I asked my family physician to increase my dose of 
benzodiazepine, so that I would not be preoccupied by nor 
preoccupy others with my anxiety. Unfortunately, I experienced a 
marked increase in negative emotion following the adjustment. I 
asked to have the dosage raised yet again (by this time, we were 
attempting to deal with the second of Tammy’s surgeries and its 
complications, and I attributed my even more severe anxiety to that 
problem), but my anxiety increased even further. I attributed all of 
this not to a paradoxical reaction to the medication (which it was 
later diagnosed as), but to the recurrence of a tendency toward 
depression that had plagued me for years.* In any case, I ceased 
using the benzodiazepine entirely in May of that year, trying two 
doses of ketamine within a week, as suggested by a psychiatrist with 
whom I consulted. Ketamine, a nonstandard anesthetic/psychedelic, 
sometimes has overwhelming and sudden positive effects on 
depression. It produced nothing for me but two ninety-minute trips 
to hell. I felt to my bones as if I had everything to feel guilty and 
ashamed about, with nothing gained by my positive experiences. 

A few days after the second ketamine experience, I began to 
suffer the effects of acute benzodiazepine withdrawal, which were 
truly intolerable—anxiety far beyond what I had ever experienced, 
an uncontrollable restlessness and need to move (formally known 


as akathisia), overwhelming thoughts of self-destruction, and the 
complete absence of any happiness whatsoever. A family friend—a 
physician—enlightened me as to the dangers of sudden 
benzodiazepine withdrawal. I therefore started to take a 
benzodiazepine once again—but a smaller dose than I had climbed 
to previously. Many, but not all, of my symptoms abated. To deal 
with those that remained, I also began to take an antidepressant 
that had been of great use to me in the past. All it did, however, was 
make me exhausted enough to require an additional four or more 
hours of sleep a day—which was not helpful in the midst of 
Tammy’s serious health issues—as well as increase my appetite two- 
or threefold. 

After about three months of terrible anxiety, uncontrollable 
hypersomnia, viciously torturous akathisia, and excessive appetite, I 
traveled to an American clinic that claimed to specialize in rapid 
benzodiazepine withdrawal. Despite the good intentions of many of 
its psychiatrists, the clinic managed only a slow cessation or 
tapering of my benzodiazepine dosage, the negative effects of which 
I was already experiencing and which were not and could not be 
controlled to any significant degree whatsoever by the inpatient 
treatment offered. 

I resided at that clinic, nonetheless, from mid-August, a mere few 
days after Tammy had recovered from her postsurgical 
complications, to late November, when I returned home to Toronto, 
much the worse for wear. By this time, the akathisia (the disorder of 
uncontrollable movement alluded to earlier) had increased to the 
point where I could not sit or rest in any position for any length of 
time whatsoever without severe distress. In December I checked in 
to a local hospital, and it was at that point that my awareness of 
events prior to my awakening in Moscow ends. As I later learned, 
Mikhaila and Andrey removed me from the Toronto hospital in 
early January 2020, believing that the treatment I received there 
was doing me more harm than good (an opinion I concurred with 
entirely once I learned of it). 

The situation I found myself in upon reattaining consciousness in 
Russia was complicated by the fact that I had also developed double 


pneumonia in Canada, although that was neither discovered nor 
treated until I was in the Moscow ICU. However, I was there 
primarily so that the clinic could facilitate my withdrawal from 
benzodiazepines, using a procedure either unknown or regarded as 
too dangerous in North America. Since I had not been able to 
tolerate any decrease in dosage whatsoever—apart from the initial 
reduction, months before—the clinic placed me in a medically 
induced coma so that I might remain unconscious during the very 
worst withdrawal symptoms. That regimen started January 5 and 
lasted nine days, during which I was also placed in a machine so 
that my breathing was mechanically regulated. On January 14, I was 
taken off the anesthetic and the intubation. I woke up for a few 
hours, and indicated during this time to Mikhaila that I was no 
longer suffering from akathisia, although I remember nothing of 
this. 

On January 23, I was moved to another ICU specializing in 
neurological rehabilitation. I can recall waking up on the twenty- 
sixth for a short period, until my more complete return to 
consciousness, as previously related, on February 5—ten days 
during which I passed through a period of delirium of vivid 
intensity. Once that cleared, I moved to a more homelike 
rehabilitation center in the outer suburbs of Moscow. While there, I 
had to relearn how to walk and up and down stairs, button my 
clothes, lie down in bed on my own, place my hands in the proper 
position on a computer keyboard, and type. I did not seem to be able 
to see properly—or, more accurately, see how to use my limbs to 
interact with what I perceived. A few weeks later, after the problems 
in perception and coordination had essentially abated, Mikhaila, 
Andrey, their child, and I relocated to Florida for what we hoped 
would be some peaceful time of recuperation in the sun (very much 
welcome after the cold grayness of midwinter Moscow). This was 
immediately before worldwide concern erupted over the COVID-19 
pandemic. 

In Florida, I attempted to wean off the medication prescribed by 
the Moscow clinic, although I was still experiencing numbness in 
my left hand and foot, trembling of those two extremities as well as 


the muscles in my forehead, seizure activity, and crippling anxiety. 
All these symptoms increased quite markedly as my intake of 
medication decreased, reaching the point where about two months 
later I returned to the dosages initially prescribed in Russia. This 
was a material defeat, as the process of lessening their use had been 
fueled by an optimism that was consequently shattered, as well as 
returning me to a state of medication usage that I had paid a heavy 
price for trying to eliminate. I had family members and friends stay 
with me during this time, thankfully, and their company helped me 
stay motivated to continue while the symptoms I was experiencing 
grew unbearable, particularly in the morning. 

By the end of May, three months after leaving Russia, it had 
become obvious that I was worsening instead of improving, and 
relying on the people I loved and who reciprocated that emotion was 
both untenable and unfair. Mikhaila and Andrey had been in touch 
with a Serbian clinic that practiced a novel approach to the problem 
of benzodiazepine withdrawal, and they made arrangements to 
move me there, only two days after that country had reopened after 
the pandemic closure. 

I am not going to make a claim that the events that befell my 
wife, me, and those who were closely involved in her care added up, 
in the final analysis, to some greater good. What happened to her 
was truly awful. She experienced a severe and near-fatal crisis of 
health every two or three days for more than half a year, and then 
had to cope with my illness and absence. I was plagued, for my part, 
with the likely loss of someone whom I had befriended for fifty 
years and been married to for thirty; the observation of the terrible 
consequences of that on her other family members, including our 
children; and the dire and dreadful consequences of a substance 
dependence I had unwittingly stumbled into. I am not going to 
cheapen any of that by claiming that we became better people for 
living through it. However, I can say that passing so near to death 
motivated my wife to attend to some issues regarding her own 
spiritual and creative development more immediately and 
assiduously than she might otherwise have, and me to write or to 
preserve while editing only those words in this book that retained 


their significance even under conditions characterized by extreme 
suffering. It is certainly thanks to family and friends (who are 
named specifically in the Coda of this book) that we are still alive, 
but it is also true that the meaningful immersion in what I was 
writing, which continued during the entire time I have related— 
excepting my unconscious month in Russia—provided me both with 
a reason to live and a means of testing the viability of the thoughts 
with which I wrestled. 

I do not believe I have ever claimed—in my previous book or, 
indeed, this one—that it would be necessarily sufficient to live by 
the rules I have presented. I think what I claimed—what I hope I 
claimed—was this: When you are visited by chaos and swallowed 
up; when nature curses you or someone you love with illness; or 
when tyranny rends asunder something of value that you have built, 
it is salutary to know the rest of the story. All of that misfortune is 
only the bitter half of the tale of existence, without taking note of 
the heroic element of redemption or the nobility of the human spirit 
requiring a certain responsibility to shoulder. We ignore that 
addition to the story at our peril, because life is so difficult that 
losing sight of the heroic part of existence could cost us everything. 
We do not want that to happen. We need instead to take heart, and 
to take spirit, and to look at things carefully and properly, and to live 
the way that we could live. 

You have sources of strength upon which you can draw, and even 
though they may not work well, they may be enough. You have what 
you can learn if you can accept your error. You have medications 
and hospitals, as well as physicians and nurses who genuinely and 
bravely care to lift you up and help you through every day. And then 
you have your own character and courage, and if those have been 
beat to a bloody pulp and you are ready to throw in the towel, you 
have the character and courage of those for whom you care and who 
care for you. And maybe, just maybe, with all that, you can get 
through. I can tell you what has saved me, so far—the love I have for 
my family; the love they have for me; the encouragement they have 
delivered, along with my friends; the fact that I still had meaningful 
work I could struggle through while in the abyss. I had to force 


myself to sit down at the computer. I had to force myself to 
concentrate, and to breathe, and to keep from saying and meaning 
“to hell with it” during the endless months that I was possessed by 
dread and terror. And I was barely able to do it. More than half the 
time I believed that I was going to die in one of the many hospitals 
in which I resided. And I believe that if I had fallen prey to 
resentment, for example, I would have perished once and for all— 
and that I am fortunate to have avoided such a fate. 

Is it not possible (even though it may not always deliver us from 
the terrible situation that we find ourselves in) that we would all be 
more able to deal with uncertainty, the horrors of nature, the 
tyranny of culture, and the malevolence of ourselves and others if 
we were better and more courageous people? If we strived toward 
higher values? If we were more truthful? Wouldn’t the beneficial 
elements of experience be more likely to manifest themselves 
around us? Is it not possible, if your goals were noble enough, your 
courage adequate, your aim at the truth unerring, that the Good 
thereby produced would... well, not justify the horror? That is not 
exactly right, but it still comes close. Such attitudes and actions 
might at least provide us with meaning sufficient to stop our 
encounter with that terror and horror from corrupting us and 
turning the surrounding world into something all too closely 
resembling hell. 

Why Beyond Order? It is simple, in some regard. Order is 
explored territory. We are in order when the actions we deem 
appropriate produce the results we aim at. We regard such 
outcomes positively, indicating as they do, first, that we have moved 
closer to what we desire, and second, that our theory about how the 
world works remains acceptably accurate. Nonetheless, all states of 
order, no matter how secure and comfortable, have their flaws. Our 
knowledge of how to act in the world remains eternally incomplete 
—partly because of our profound ignorance of the vast unknown, 
partly because of our willful blindness, and partly because the world 
continues, in its entropic manner, to transform itself unexpectedly. 
Furthermore, the order we strive to impose on the world can rigidify 
as a consequence of ill-advised attempts to eradicate from 


consideration all that is unknown. When such attempts go too far, 
totalitarianism threatens, driven by the desire to exercise full 
control where such control is not possible, even in principle. This 
means risking a dangerous restriction of all the psychological and 
social changes necessary to maintain adaptation to the ever- 
changing world. And so we find ourselves inescapably faced with the 
need to move beyond order, into its opposite: chaos. 

If order is where what we want makes itself known—when we act 
in accordance with our hard-won wisdom—chaos is where what we 
do not expect or have remained blind to leaps forward from the 
potential that surrounds us. The fact that something has occurred 
many times in the past is no guarantee that it will continue to occur 
in the same manner.* There exists, eternally, a domain beyond what 
we know and can predict. Chaos is anomaly, novelty, 
unpredictability, transformation, disruption, and all too often, 
descent, as what we have come to take for granted reveals itself as 
unreliable. Sometimes it manifests itself gently, revealing its 
mysteries in experience that makes us curious, compelled, and 
interested. This is particularly likely, although not inevitable, when 
we approach what we do not understand voluntarily, with careful 
preparation and discipline. Other times the unexpected makes itself 
known terribly, suddenly, accidentally, so we are undone, and fall 
apart, and can only put ourselves back together with great difficulty 
—if at all. 

Neither the state of order nor the state of chaos is preferable, 
intrinsically, to the other. That is the wrong way to look at it. 
Nonetheless, in my previous book, 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote to 
Chaos, I focused more on how the consequences of too much chaos 
might be remediated.* We respond to sudden and unpredictable 
change by preparing, physiologically and psychologically, for the 
worst. And because only God Himself knows what this worst might 
be, we must in our ignorance prepare for all eventualities. And the 
problem with that continual preparation is that, in excess, it 
exhausts us. But that does not imply in any manner that chaos 
should be eliminated (an impossibility, in any case), although what 
is unknown needs to be managed carefully, as my previous book 


repeatedly stressed. Whatever is not touched by the new stagnates, 
and it is certainly the case that a life without curiosity—that instinct 
pushing us out into the unknown—would be a much-diminished 
form of existence. What is new is also what is exciting, compelling, 
and provocative, assuming that the rate at which it is introduced 
does not intolerably undermine and destabilize our state of being. 

Like 12 Rules for Life, the current volume provides an explication 
of rules drawn from a longer list of 42, originally published and 
popularized on the Q and A website Quora. Unlike my previous 
book, Beyond Order explores as its overarching theme how the 
dangers of too much security and control might be profitably 
avoided. Because what we understand is insufficient (as we discover 
when things we are striving to control nonetheless go wrong around 
us), we need to keep one foot within order while stretching the 
other tentatively into the beyond. And so we are driven to explore 
and find the deepest of meanings in standing on the frontier, secure 
enough to keep our fear under control but learning, constantly 
learning, as we face what we have not yet made peace with or 
adapted to. It is this instinct of meaning—something far deeper than 
mere thought—that orients us properly in life, so that we do not 
become overwhelmed by what is beyond us, or equally dangerously, 
stultified and stunted by dated, too narrow, or too pridefully 
paraded systems of value and belief. 

What have I written about, more specifically? Rule I describes the 
relationship between stable, predictable social structures and 
individual psychological health, and makes the case that such 
structures need to be updated by creative people if they are to retain 
their vitality. Rule II analyzes a centuries-old alchemical image, 
relying on several stories—ancient and modern—to illuminate the 
nature and development of the integrated human personality. Rule 
III warns of the dangers of avoiding the information (vital to the 
continual rejuvenation of the psyche) signaled by the emergence of 
negative emotions such as pain, anxiety, and fear. 

Rule IV argues that the meaning that sustains people through 
difficult times is to be found not so much in happiness, which is 
fleeting, but in in the voluntary adoption of mature responsibility 


for the self and others. Rule V uses a single example, drawn from 
my experience as a clinical psychologist, to illustrate the personal 
and social necessity of attending to the dictates of conscience. Rule 
VI describes the danger of attributing the cause of complex 
individual and social problems to single variables such as sex, class, 
or power. 

Rule VII outlines the crucial relationship between disciplined 
striving in a single direction and forging of the individual character 
capable of resilience in the face of adversity. Rule VIII focuses on 
the vital importance of aesthetic experience as a guide to what is 
true, good, and sustaining in the human world of experience. Rule 
IX makes the case that past experiences, whose current recall 
remains laden with pain and fear, can be stripped of their horror by 
voluntary verbal exploration and reconsideration. 

Rule X notes the importance of explicit negotiation to 
maintenance of the good will, mutual regard, and heartfelt 
cooperation without which no true romance can be sustained. Rule 
XI opens by describing the world of human experience in a manner 
that explains what motivates three common but direly dangerous 
patterns of psychological response, delineates the catastrophic 
consequences of falling prey to any or all of them, and lays out an 
alternative route. Rule XII makes the case that thankfulness in the 
face of the inevitable tragedies of life should be regarded as a 
primary manifestation of the admirable moral courage required to 
continue our difficult march uphill.* 

I hope that I am somewhat wiser in my explication of this second 
set of 12 rules than I was four years ago, when I wrote about the 
first dozen—not least because of the informative feedback I received 
in the course of my efforts to formulate my ideas for audiences 
around the world, in person, on YouTube, and through my podcast 
and blog.* I hope, in consequence, that I have managed to clarify 
some of the issues that were perhaps left less than optimally 
developed in my previous work, as well as presenting much that is 
original. Finally, I hope that people find this book as helpful 
personally as they seem to have found the first set of 12 Rules. It 
has been a source of immense gratification that so many people 


have reported drawing strength from the thoughts and the stories I 
have had the privilege of bringing forth and sharing. 


RULE | 


DO NOT CARELESSLY DENIGRATE SOCIAL 
INSTITUTIONS OR CREATIVE ACHIEVEMENT 


LONELINESS AND CONFUSION 


For years, I saw a client who lived by himself.” He was isolated in 
many other ways in addition to his living situation. He had 
extremely limited family ties. Both of his daughters had moved out 
of the country, and did not maintain much contact, and he had no 
other relatives except a father and sister from whom he was 
estranged. His wife and the mother of his children had passed away 
years ago, and the sole relationship he endeavored to establish 
while he saw me over the course of more than a decade and a half 
terminated tragically when his new partner was killed in an 
automobile accident. 

When we began to work together, our conversations were 
decidedly awkward. He was not accustomed to the subtleties of 
social interaction, so his behaviors, verbal and nonverbal, lacked the 
dance-like rhythm and harmony that characterize the socially 
fluent. As a child, he had been thoroughly ignored as well as actively 
discouraged by both parents. His father—mostly absent—was 
neglectful and sadistic in his inclinations, while his mother was 
chronically alcoholic. He had also been consistently tormented and 
harassed at school, and had not chanced upon a teacher in all his 
years of education who paid him any genuine attention. These 
experiences left my client with a proclivity toward depression, or at 
least worsened what might have been a biological tendency in that 


direction. He was, in consequence, abrupt, irritable, and somewhat 
volatile if he felt misunderstood or was unexpectedly interrupted 
during a conversation. Such reactions helped ensure that his 
targeting by bullies continued into his adult life, particularly in his 
place of work. 

I soon noticed, however, that things worked out quite well during 
our sessions if I kept mostly quiet. He would drop in, weekly or 
biweekly, and talk about what had befallen and preoccupied him 
during the previous seven to fourteen days. If I maintained silence 
for the first fifty minutes of our one-hour sessions, listening 
intently, then we could converse, in a relatively normal, reciprocal 
manner, for the remaining ten minutes. This pattern continued for 
more than a decade, as I learned, increasingly, to hold my tongue 
(something that does not come easily to me). As the years passed, 
however, I noticed that the proportion of time he spent discussing 
negative issues with me decreased. Our conversation—his 
monologue, really—had always started with what was bothering 
him, and rarely progressed past that. But he worked hard outside 
our sessions, cultivating friends, attending artistic gatherings and 
music festivals, and resurrecting a long-dormant talent for 
composing songs and playing the guitar. As he became more social, 
he began to generate solutions to the problems he communicated to 
me, and to discuss, in the latter portion of the hours we shared, 
some of the more positive aspects of his existence. It was slow 
going, but he made continual incremental progress. When he first 
came to see me, we could not sit together at a table in a coffee shop 
—or, indeed, in any public space—and practice anything resembling 
a real-world conversation without his being paralyzed into absolute 
silence. By the time we finished, he was reading his original poetry 
in front of small groups, and had even tried his hand at stand-up 
comedy. 

He was the best personal and practical exemplar of something I 
had come to realize over my more than twenty years of 
psychological practice: people depend on constant communication 
with others to keep their minds organized. We all need to think to 
keep things straight, but we mostly think by talking. We need to talk 


about the past, so we can distinguish the trivial, overblown concerns 
that otherwise plague our thoughts from the experiences that are 
truly important. We need to talk about the nature of the present and 
our plans for the future, so we know where we are, where we are 
going, and why we are going there. We must submit the strategies 
and tactics we formulate to the judgments of others, to ensure their 
efficiency and resilience. We need to listen to ourselves as we talk, 
as well, so that we may organize our otherwise inchoate bodily 
reactions, motivations, and emotions into something articulate and 
organized, and dispense with those concerns that are exaggerated 
and irrational. We need to talk—both to remember and to forget. 

My client desperately needed someone to listen to him. He also 
needed to be fully part of additional, larger, and more complex 
social groups—something he planned in our sessions together, and 
then carried out on his own. Had he fallen prey to the temptation to 
denigrate the value of interpersonal interactions and relationships 
because of his history of isolation and harsh treatment, he would 
have had very little chance of regaining his health and well-being. 
Instead, he learned the ropes and joined the world. 


SANITY AS A SOCIAL INSTITUTION 


For Drs. Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, the great depth 
psychologists, sanity was a characteristic of the individual mind. 
People were well-adjusted, in their views, when the subpersonalities 
existing within each of them were properly integrated and balanced 
in expression. The id, the instinctive part of the psyche (from the 
German “it,” representing nature, in all its power and foreignness, 
inside us); the superego (the sometimes oppressive, internalized 
representative of social order); and the ego (the I, the personality 
proper, crushed between those two necessary tyrants)—all had their 
specialized functions for Freud, who first conceptualized their 
existence. Id, ego, and superego interacted with each other like the 
executive, legislative, and judicial branches of a modern 
government. Jung, although profoundly influenced by Freud, parsed 


the complexity of the psyche in a different manner. For him, the ego 
of the individual had to find its proper place in relationship to the 
shadow (the dark side of the personality), the anima or animus (the 
contrasexual and thus often repressed side of the personality), and 
the self (the internal being of ideal possibility). But all these 
different subentities, Jungian and Freudian alike, share one thing in 
common: they exist in the interior of the person, regardless of his or 
her surroundings. People are social beings, however—par excellence 
—and there is no shortage of wisdom and guidance outside of us, 
embedded in the social world. Why rely on our own limited 
resources to remember the road, or to orient ourselves in new 
territory, when we can rely on signs and guideposts placed there so 
effortfully by others? Freud and Jung, with their intense focus on 
the autonomous individual psyche, placed too little focus on the 
role of the community in the maintenance of personal mental 
health. 

It is for such reasons that I assess the position of all my new 
clinical clients along a few dimensions largely dependent on the 
social world when I first start working with them: Have they been 
educated to the level of their intellectual ability or ambition? Is 
their use of free time engaging, meaningful, and productive? Have 
they formulated solid and well-articulated plans for the future? Are 
they (and those they are close to) free of any serious physical health 
or economic problems? Do they have friends and a social life? A 
stable and satisfying intimate partnership? Close and functional 
familial relationships? A career—or, at least, a job—that is 
financially sufficient, stable and, if possible, a source of satisfaction 
and opportunity? If the answer to any three or more of these 
questions is no, I consider that my new client is insufficiently 
embedded in the interpersonal world and is in danger of spiraling 
downward psychologically because of that. People exist among other 
people and not as purely individual minds. An individual does not 
have to be that well put together if he or she can remain at least 
minimally acceptable in behavior to others. Simply put: We 
outsource the problem of sanity. People remain mentally healthy 
not merely because of the integrity of their own minds, but because 


they are constantly being reminded how to think, act, and speak by 
those around them. 

If you begin to deviate from the straight and narrow path—if you 
begin to act improperly—people will react to your errors before they 
become too great, and cajole, laugh, tap, and criticize you back into 
place. They will raise an eyebrow, or smile (or not), or pay attention 
(or not). If other people can tolerate having you around, in other 
words, they will constantly remind you not to misbehave, and just 
as constantly call on you to be at your best. All that is left for you to 
do is watch, listen, and respond appropriately to the cues. Then you 
might remain motivated, and able to stay together enough so that 
you will not begin the long journey downhill. This is reason enough 
to appreciate your immersion in the world of other people—friends, 
family members, and foes alike—despite the anxiety and frustration 
that social interactions so often produce. 

But how did we develop the broad consensus regarding social 
behavior that serves to buttress our psychological stability? It seems 
a daunting task—if not impossible—in the face of the complexity 
that constantly confronts us. “Do we pursue this or that?” “How 
does the worth of this piece of work compare to the worth of that?” 
“Who is more competent, or more creative, or more assertive, and 
should therefore be ceded authority?” Answers to such questions 
are largely formulated in consequence of intensive negotiation— 
verbal and nonverbal—regulating individual action, cooperation, and 
competition. What we deem to be valuable and worthy of attention 
becomes part of the social contract; part of the rewards and 
punishments meted out respectively for compliance and 
noncompliance; part of what continually indicates and reminds: 
“Here is what is valued. Look at that (perceive that) and not 
something else. Pursue that (act toward that end) and not some 
other.” Compliance with those indications and reminders is, in large 
measure, sanity itself—and is something required from every one of 
us right from the early stages of our lives. Without the 
intermediation of the social world, it would be impossible for us to 
organize our minds, and we would simply be overwhelmed by the 
world. 


THE POINT OF POINTING 


I have the great good fortune of a granddaughter, Elizabeth Scarlett 
Peterson Korikova, born in August 2017. I have watched her 
carefully while she develops, trying to understand what she is up to 
and playing along with it. When she was about a year and a half old, 
she engaged in all manner of unbearably endearing behaviors— 
giggling and laughing when she was poked, high-fiving, bumping 
heads, and rubbing noses. However, in my opinion, the most 
noteworthy of all the actions she undertook at that age was her 
pointing. 

She had discovered her index finger, using it to specify all the 
objects in the world she found interesting. She delighted in doing 
so, particularly when her pointing called forth the attention of the 
adults surrounding her. This indicated, in a manner not duplicable 
in any other way, that her action and intention had import— 
definable at least in part as the tendency of a behavior or attitude to 
compel the attention of others. She thrived on that, and no wonder. 
We compete for attention, personally, socially, and economically. 
No currency has a value that exceeds it. Children, adults, and 
societies wither on the vine in its absence. To have others attend to 
what you find important or interesting is to validate, first, the 
importance of what you are attending to, but second, and more 
crucially, to validate you as a respected center of conscious 
experience and contributor to the collective world. Pointing is, as 
well, a crucial precursor to the development of language. To name 
something—to use the word for the thing—is essentially to point to 
it, to specify it against everything else, to isolate it for use 
individually and socially. 

When my granddaughter pointed, she did it publicly. When she 
pointed to something, she could immediately observe how the 
people close to her reacted. There is just not that much point, so to 
speak, in pointing to something that no one else cares about. So, she 
aimed her index finger at something she found interesting and then 
looked around to see if anyone else cared. She was learning an 
important lesson at an early age: If you are not communicating 


about anything that engages other people, then the value of your 
communication—even the value of your very presence—risks falling 
to zero. It was in this manner that she began to more profoundly 
explore the complex hierarchy of value that made up her family and 
the broader society surrounding her. 

Scarlett is now learning to talk—a more sophisticated form of 
pointing (and of exploration). Every word is a pointer, as well as a 
simplification or generalization. To name something is not only to 
make it shine forth against the infinite background of potentially 
nameable things, but to group or categorize it, simultaneously, with 
many other phenomena of its broad utility or significance. We use 
the word “floor,” for example, but do not generally employ a 
separate word for all the floors we might encounter (concrete, wood, 
earth, glass), much less all the endless variations of color and 
texture and shade that make up the details of the floors that bear 
our weight. We use a low-resolution representation: If it holds us 
up, we can walk on it, and is situated inside a building, then it is a 
“floor,” and that is precise enough. The word distinguishes floors, 
say, from walls, but also restricts the variability in all the floors that 
exist to a single concept—flat, stable, walkable indoor surfaces. 

The words we employ are tools that structure our experience, 
subjectively and privately—but are, equally, socially determined. We 
would not all know and use the word “floor” unless we had all 
agreed that there was something sufficiently important about floors 
to justify a word for them. So, the mere fact of naming something 
(and, of course, agreeing on the name) is an important part of the 
process whereby the infinitely complex world of phenomena and 
fact is reduced to the functional world of value. And it is continual 
interaction with social institutions that makes this reduction—this 
specification—possible. 


WHAT SHOULD WE POINT TO? 


The social world narrows and specifies the world for us, marking 
out what is important. But what does “important” mean? How is it 


determined? The individual is molded by the social world. But social 
institutions are molded, too, by the requirements of the individuals 
who compose them. Arrangements must be made for our 
provisioning with the basic requirements of life. We cannot live 
without food, water, clean air, and shelter. Less self-evidently, we 
require companionship, play, touch, and intimacy. These are all 
biological as well as psychological necessities (and this is by no 
means a comprehensive list). We must signify and then utilize 
those elements of the world capable of providing us with these 
requirements. And the fact that we are deeply social adds another 
set of constraints to the situation: We must perceive and act in a 
manner that meets our biological and psychological needs—but, 
since none of us lives or can live in isolation, we must meet them in 
a manner approved of by others. This means that the solutions we 
apply to our fundamental biological problems must also be 
acceptable and implementable socially. 

It is worth considering more deeply just how necessity limits the 
universe of viable solutions and implementable plans. First, as we 
alluded to, the plan must in principle solve some real problem. 
Second, it must appeal to others—often in the face of competing 
plans—or those others will not cooperate and might well object. If I 
value something, therefore, I must determine how to value it so that 
others potentially benefit. It cannot just be good for me: it must be 
good for me and for the people around me. And even that is not 
good enough—which means there are even more constraints on how 
the world must be perceived and acted upon. The manner in which I 
view and value the world, integrally associated with the plans I am 
making, has to work for me, my family, and the broader community. 
Furthermore, it needs to work today, in a manner that does not 
make a worse hash of tomorrow, next week, next month, and next 
year (even the next decade or century). A good solution to a problem 
involving suffering must be repeatable, without deterioration across 
repetitions—iterable, in a word—across people and across time. 

These universal constraints, manifest biologically and imposed 
socially, reduce the complexity of the world to something 
approximating a universally understandable domain of value. That 


is exceptionally important, because there are unlimited problems 
and there are hypothetically unlimited potential solutions, but there 
are a comparatively limited number of solutions that work 
practically, psychologically, and socially simultaneously. The fact of 
limited solutions implies the existence of something like a natural 
ethic—variable, perhaps, as human languages are variable, but still 
characterized by something solid and universally recognizable at its 
base. It is the reality of this natural ethic that makes thoughtless 
denigration of social institutions both wrong and dangerous: wrong 
and dangerous because those institutions have evolved to solve 
problems that must be solved for life to continue. They are by no 
means perfect—but making them better, rather than worse, is a 
tricky problem indeed. 

So, I must take the complexity of the world, reduce it to a single 
point so that I can act, and take everyone else and their future 
selves into consideration while I am doing so. How do I manage 
this? By communicating and negotiating. By outsourcing the 
terribly complex cognitive problem to the resources of the broader 
world. The individuals who compose every society cooperate and 
compete linguistically (although linguistic interaction by no means 
exhausts the means of cooperation and competition). Words are 
formulated collectively, and everyone must agree on their use. The 
verbal framework that helps us delimit the world is a consequence 
of the landscape of value that is constructed socially—but also 
bounded by the brute necessity of reality itself. This helps give that 
landscape shape, and not just any old shape. This is where 
hierarchies—functional, productive hierarchies—more clearly enter 
the picture. 

Things of import must be done, or people starve or die of thirst or 
exposure—or of loneliness and absence of touch. What needs to be 
done must be specified and planned. The requisite skills for doing 
so must be developed. That specification, planning, and 
development of skills, as well as the implementation of the 
informed plan, must be conducted in social space, with the 
cooperation of others (and in the face of their competition). In 
consequence, some will be better at solving the problem at hand, 


and others worse. This variance in ability (as well as the multiplicity 
of extant problems and the impossibility of training everyone in all 
skilled domains) necessarily engenders a hierarchical structure— 
based ideally on genuine competence in relation to the goal. Such a 
hierarchy is in its essence a socially structured tool that must be 
employed for the effective accomplishment of necessary and 
worthwhile tasks. It is also a social institution that makes progress 
and peace possible at the same time. 


BOTTOM UP 


The consensus making up the spoken and unspoken assumptions of 
worth characterizing our societies has an ancient origin, developing 
over the course of hundreds of millions of years. After all, “How 
should you act?” is just the short-term, immediate version of the 
fundamental long-term question, “How should you survive?” It is 
therefore instructive to look into the distant past—far down the 
evolutionary chain, right to the basics—and contemplate the 
establishment of what is important. The most phylogenetically 
ancient multicellular organisms (that is far enough for our 
purposes) tend to be composed of relatively undifferentiated 
sensorimotor cells.* These cells map certain facts or features of the 
environment directly onto the motor output of the same cells, in an 
essentially one-to-one relationship. Stimulus A means response A, 
and nothing else, while stimulus B means response B. Among more 
differentiated and complex creatures—the larger and commonly 
recognizable denizens of the natural world—the sensory and motor 
functions separate and specialize, such that cells undertaking the 
former functions detect patterns in the world and cells in the latter 
produce patterns of motor output. This differentiation enables a 
broader range of patterns to be recognized and mapped, as well as a 
broader range of action and reaction to be undertaken. A third type 
of cell—neural—emerges sometimes, as well, serving as a 
computational intermediary between the first two. Among species 
that have established a neural level of operation, the “same” pattern 


of input can produce a different pattern of output (depending, for 
example, on changes in the animal’s environment or internal 
psychophysical condition). 

As nervous systems increase in sophistication, and more and 
more layers of neural intermediation emerge, the relationship 
between simple fact and motor output becomes increasingly 
complex, unpredictable, and sophisticated. What is putatively the 
same thing or situation can be perceived in multiple ways, and two 
things perceived in the same manner can still give rise to very 
different behaviors. It is very difficult to constrain even isolated 
laboratory animals, for example, so thoroughly that they will behave 
predictably across trials that have been made as similar as possible. 
As the layers of neural tissue mediating between sensation and 
action multiply, they also differentiate. Basic motivational systems, 
often known as drives, appear (hunger, thirst, aggression, etc.), 
adding additional sensory and behavioral specificity and variability. 
Superseding motivations, in turn—with no clear line of demarcation 
—are systems of emotion. Cognitive systems emerge much later, 
first taking form, arguably, as imagination, and later—and only 
among human beings—as full-fledged language. Thus, in the most 
complex of creatures, there is an internal hierarchy of structure, 
from reflex through drive to language-mediated action (in the 
particular case of human beings), that must be organized before it 
can function as a unity and be aimed at a point. 

How is this hierarchy organized—a structure that emerged in 
large part from the bottom up, over the vast spans of evolutionary 
time? We return to the same answer alluded to earlier: through the 
constant cooperation and competition—the constant jockeying for 
resources and position—defining the struggle for survival and 
reproduction. This happens over the unimaginably lengthy spans of 
time that characterize evolution, as well as the much shorter course 
of each individual life. Negotiation for position sorts organisms into 
the omnipresent hierarchies that govern access to vital resources 
such as shelter, nourishment, and mates. All creatures of reasonable 
complexity and even a minimally social nature have their particular 
place, and know it. All social creatures also learn what is deemed 


valuable by other group members, and derive from that, as well as 
from the understanding of their own position, a sophisticated 
implicit and explicit understanding of value itself. In a phrase: The 
internal hierarchy that translates facts into actions mirrors the 
external hierarchy of social organization. It is clear, for example, 
that chimpanzees in a troop understand their social world and its 
hierarchical strata at a fine level of detail. They know what is 
important, and who has privileged access to it. They understand 
such things as if their survival and reproduction depend upon it, as 
it does.* 

A newborn infant is equipped with relatively deterministic 
reflexes: sucking, crying, startling. These nonetheless provide the 
starting point for the immense range of skills in action that develop 
with human maturation. By the age of two (and often much earlier 
than that, for many skills), children can orient with all their senses, 
walk upright, use their opposable-thumb-equipped hands for all 
sorts of purposes, and communicate their desires and needs both 
nonverbally and verbally—and this is of course a partial list. This 
immense array of behavioral abilities is integrated into a complex 
assortment of emotions and motivational drives (anger, sadness, 
fear, joy, surprise, and more) and then organized to fulfill whatever 
specific, narrow purpose inspires the child for the moment and, 
increasingly, over longer spans of time. 

The developing infant must also hone and perfect the operation 
of his or her currently dominant motivational state in harmony with 
all his or her other internal motivational states (as, for example, the 
separate desire to eat, sleep, and play must learn to coexist so each 
can manifest itself optimally), and in keeping with the demands, 
routines, and opportunities of the social environment. This honing 
and perfecting begin within the child’s maternal relationship and 
the spontaneous play behavior within that circumscribed but still 
social context. Then, when the child has matured to the point where 
the internal hierarchy of emotional and motivational functions can 
be subsumed, even temporarily, within a framework provided by a 
conscious, communicable abstract goal (“let us play house”), the 


child is ready to play with others—and to do so, over time, in an 
increasingly complex and sophisticated manner.* 

Play with others depends (as the great developmental 
psychologist Jean Piaget observed*) upon the collective 
establishment of a shared goal with the child’s play partners. The 
collective establishment of a shared goal—the point of the game— 
conjoined with rules governing cooperation and competition in 
relationship to that goal or point, constitutes a true social 
microcosm. All societies might be regarded as variations upon this 
play/game theme—E pluribus unum*—and in all functional and 
decent societies the basic rules of fair play, predicated upon 
reciprocity across situation and time, come inevitably to apply. 
Games, like solutions to problems, must be iterable to endure, and 
there are principles that apply to and undergird what constitutes 
that iterability. Piaget suspected, for example, that games 
undertaken voluntarily will outcompete games imposed and played 
under threat of force, given that some of the energy that could be 
expended on the game itself, whatever its nature, has to be wasted 
on enforcement. There is evidence indicating the emergence of such 
voluntary game-like arrangements even among our nonhuman kin.* 

The universal rules of fair play include the ability to regulate 
emotion and motivation while cooperating and competing in pursuit 
of the goal during the game (that is part and parcel of being able to 
play at all), as well as the ability and will to establish reciprocally 
beneficial interactions across time and situation, as we already 
discussed. And life is not simply a game, but a series of games, each 
of which has something in common (whatever defines a game) and 
something unique (or there would be no reason for multiple 
games). At minimum, there is a starting point (kindergarten, a O—O 
score, a first date, an entry-level job) that needs to be improved 
upon; a procedure for enacting that improvement; and a desirable 
goal (graduation from high school, a winning score, a permanent 
romantic relationship, a prestigious career). Because of that 
commonality, there is an ethic—or more properly, a meta-ethic— 
that emerges, from the bottom up, across the set of all games. The 
best player is therefore not the winner of any given game but, 


among many other things, he or she who is invited by the largest 
number of others to play the most extensive series of games. It is 
for this reason, which you may not understand explicitly at the time, 
that you tell your children: “It’s not whether you win or lose. It’s 
how you play the game!”* How should you play, to be that most 
desirable of players? What structure must take form within you so 
that such play is possible? And those two questions are interrelated, 
because the structure that will enable you to play properly (and with 
increasing and automated or habitual precision) will emerge only in 
the process of continually practicing the art of playing properly. 
Where might you learn how to play? Everywhere... if you are 
fortunate and awake. 


THE UTILITY OF THE FOOL 


It is useful to take your place at the bottom of a hierarchy. It can aid 
in the development of gratitude and humility. Gratitude: There are 
people whose expertise exceeds your own, and you should be wisely 
pleased about that. There are many valuable niches to fill, given the 
many complex and serious problems we must solve. The fact that 
there are people who fill those niches with trustworthy skill and 
experience is something for which to be truly thankful. Humility: It 
is better to presume ignorance and invite learning than to assume 
sufficient knowledge and risk the consequent blindness. It is much 
better to make friends with what you do not know than with what 
you do know, as there is an infinite supply of the former but a finite 
stock of the latter. When you are tightly boxed in or cornered—all 
too often by your own stubborn and fixed adherence to some 
unconsciously worshipped assumptions—all there is to help you is 
what you have not yet learned. 

It is necessary and helpful to be, and in some ways to remain, a 
beginner. For this reason, the Tarot deck beloved by intuitives, 
romantics, fortune-tellers, and scoundrels alike contains within it 
the Fool as a positive card, an illustrated variant of which opens this 
chapter. The Fool is a young, handsome man, eyes lifted upward, 


journeying in the mountains, sun shining brightly upon him—about 
to carelessly step over a cliff (or is he?). His strength, however, is 
precisely his willingness to risk such a drop; to risk being once again 
at the bottom. No one unwilling to be a foolish beginner can learn. 
It was for this reason, among others, that Carl Jung regarded the 
Fool as the archetypal precursor to the figure of the equally 
archetypal Redeemer, the perfected individual. 

The beginner, the fool, is continually required to be patient and 
tolerant—with himself and, equally, with others. His displays of 
ignorance, inexperience, and lack of skill may still sometimes be 
rightly attributed to irresponsibility and condemned, justly, by 
others. But the insufficiency of the fool is often better regarded as 
an inevitable consequence of each individual’s essential 
vulnerability, rather than as a true moral failing. Much that is great 
starts small, ignorant, and useless. This lesson permeates popular as 
well as classical or traditional culture. Consider, for example, the 
Disney heroes Pinocchio and Simba, as well as J. K. Rowling’s 
magical Harry Potter. Pinocchio begins as a wooden-headed 
marionette, the puppet of everyone’s decisions but his own. The 
Lion King has his origin as a naive cub, the unwitting pawn of a 
treacherous and malevolent uncle. The student of wizarding is an 
unloved orphan, with a dusty cupboard for a bedroom, and 
Voldemort—who might as well be Satan himself—for his 
archenemy. Great mythologized heroes often come into the world, 
likewise, in the most meager of circumstances (as the child of an 
Israelite slave, for example, or newborn in a lowly manger) and in 
great danger (consider the Pharaoh’s decision to slay all the 
firstborn male babies of the Israelites, and Herod’s comparable 
edict, much later). But today’s beginner is tomorrow’s master. Thus, 
it is necessary even for the most accomplished (but who wishes to 
accomplish still more) to retain identification with the as yet 
unsuccessful; to appreciate the striving toward competence; to 
carefully and with true humility subordinate him or herself to the 
current game; and to develop the knowledge, self-control, and 
discipline necessary to make the next move. 


I visited a restaurant in Toronto with my wife, son, and daughter 
while writing this. As I made my way to my party’s table, a young 
waiter asked if he might say a few words to me. He told me that he 
had been watching my videos, listening to my podcasts, and reading 
my book, and that he had, in consequence, changed his attitude 
toward his comparatively lower-status (but still useful and 
necessary) job. He had ceased criticizing what he was doing or 
himself for doing it, deciding instead to be grateful and seek out 
whatever opportunities presented themselves right there before 
him. He made up his mind to become more diligent and reliable and 
to see what would happen if he worked as hard at it as he could. He 
told me, with an uncontrived smile, that he had been promoted 
three times in six months. 

The young man had come to realize that every place he might find 
himself in had more potential than he might first see (particularly 
when his vision was impaired by the resentment and cynicism he 
felt from being near the bottom). After all, it is not as if a restaurant 
is a simple place—and this was part of an extensive national 
organization, a large, high-quality chain. To do a good job in such a 
place, servers must get along with the cooks, who are by universal 
recognition a formidably troublesome and tricky lot. They must also 
be polite and engaging with customers. They have to pay attention 
constantly. They must adjust to highly varying workloads—the 
rushes and dead times that inevitably accompany the life of a server. 
They have to show up on time, sober and awake. They must treat 
their superiors with the proper respect and do the same for those— 
such as the dishwashers—below them in the structure of authority. 
And if they do all these things, and happen to be working in a 
functional institution, they will soon render themselves difficult to 
replace. Customers, colleagues, and superiors alike will begin to 
react to them in an increasingly positive manner. Doors that would 
otherwise remain closed to them—even invisible—will be opened. 
Furthermore, the skills they acquire will prove eminently portable, 
whether they continue to rise in the hierarchy of restaurateurs, 
decide instead to further their education, or change their career 
trajectory completely (in which case they will leave with laudatory 


praise from their previous employers and vastly increased chances 
of discovering the next opportunity). 

As might be expected, the young man who had something to say 
to me was thrilled with what had happened to him. His status 
concerns had been solidly and realistically addressed by his rapid 
career advance, and the additional money he was making did not 
hurt, either. He had accepted, and therefore transcended, his role as 
a beginner. He had ceased being casually cynical about the place he 
occupied in the world and the people who surrounded him, and 
accepted the structure and the position he was offered. He started to 
see possibility and opportunity, where before he was blinded, 
essentially, by his pride. He stopped denigrating the social 
institution he found himself part of and began to play his part 
properly. And that increment in humility paid off in spades. 


THE NECESSITY OF EQUALS 


It is good to be a beginner, but it is a good of a different sort to be an 
equal among equals. It is said, with much truth, that genuine 
communication can take place only between peers. This is because 
it is very difficult to move information up a hierarchy. Those well 
positioned (and this is a great danger of moving up) have used their 
current competence—their cherished opinions, their present 
knowledge, their current skills—to stake a moral claim to their 
status. In consequence, they have little motivation to admit to error, 
to learn or change—and plenty of reason not to. If a subordinate 
exposes the ignorance of someone with greater status, he risks 
humiliating that person, questioning the validity of the latter’s 
claim to influence and status, and revealing him as incompetent, 
outdated, or false. For this reason, it is very wise to approach your 
boss, for example, carefully and privately with a problem (and 
perhaps best to have a solution at hand—and not one proffered too 
incautiously). 

Barriers exist to the flow of genuine information down a 
hierarchy, as well. For example, the resentment people lower in the 


chain of command might feel about their hypothetically lesser 
position can make them loath to act productively on information 
from above—or, in the worst case, can motivate them to work at 
counterpurposes to what they have learned, out of sheer spite. In 
addition, those who are inexperienced or less educated, or who 
newly occupy a subordinate position and therefore lack knowledge 
of their surroundings, can be more easily influenced by relative 
position and the exercise of power, instead of quality of 
argumentation and observation of competence. Peers, by contrast, 
must in the main be convinced. Their attention must be carefully 
reciprocated. To be surrounded by peers is to exist in a state of 
equality, and to manifest the give-and-take necessary to maintain 
that equality. It is therefore good to be in the middle of a hierarchy. 

This is partly why friendships are so important, and why they 
form so early in life. A two-year-old, typically, is self-concerned, 
although also capable of simple reciprocal actions. The same 
Scarlett whom I talked about earlier—my granddaughter—would 
happily hand me one of her favorite stuffed toys, attached to a 
pacifier, when I asked her to. Then I would hand it, or toss it, back 
(sometimes she would toss it to me, too—or at least relatively near 
me). She loved this game. We played it with a spoon, as well—an 
implement she was just beginning to master. She played the same 
way with her mother and her grandmother—with anyone who 
happened to be within playing distance, if she was familiar enough 
with them not to be shy. This was the beginning of the behaviors 
that transform themselves into full-fledged sharing among older 
children. 

My daughter, Mikhaila, Scarlett’s mother, took her child to the 
outdoor recreational space on top of their downtown condo a few 
days before I wrote this. A number of other children were playing 
there, most of them older, and there were plenty of toys. Scarlett 
spent her time hoarding as many of the playthings as possible near 
her mother’s chair, and was distinctly unimpressed if other children 
came along to purloin one for themselves. She even took a ball 
directly from another child to add to her collection. This is typical 
behavior for children two and younger. Their ability to reciprocate, 


while hardly absent (and able to manifest itself in truly endearing 
ways), is developmentally limited. 

By three years of age, however, most children are capable of truly 
sharing. They can delay gratification long enough to take their turn 
while playing a game that everyone cannot play simultaneously. 
They can begin to understand the point of a game played by several 
people and follow the rules, although they may not be able to give a 
coherent verbal account of what those rules are. They start to form 
friendships upon repeated exposure to children with whom they 
have successfully negotiated reciprocal play relationships. Some of 
these friendships turn into the first intense relationships that 
children have outside their family. It is in the context of such 
relationships, which tend strongly to form between equals in age (or 
at least equals in developmental stage), that a child learns to bond 
tightly to a peer and starts to learn how to treat another person 
properly while requiring the same in return. 

This mutual bonding is vitally important. A child without at least 
one special, close friend is much more likely to suffer later 
psychological problems, whether of the depressive/anxious or 
antisocial sort,~ while children with fewer friends are also more 
likely to be unemployed and unmarried as adults.® There is no 
evidence that the importance of friendship declines in any manner 
with age.* All causes of mortality appear to be reduced among adults 
with high-quality social networks, even when general health status 
is taken into consideration. This remains true among the elderly in 
the case of diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, emphysema, 
and arthritis, and for younger and older adults alike in the case of 
heart attacks. Interestingly enough, there is some evidence that it is 
the provision of social support, as much or more than its receipt, 
that provides these protective benefits (and, somewhat 
unsurprisingly, that those who give more tend to receive more).® 
Thus, it truly seems that it is better to give than to receive. 

Peers distribute both the burdens and joys of life. Recently, when 
my wife, Tammy, and I suffered serious health problems, we were 
fortunate enough to have family members (my in-laws, sister and 
brother; my own mother and sister; our children) and close friends 


stay with us and help for substantial periods of time. They were 
willing to put their own lives on hold to aid us while we were in 
crisis. Before that, when my book 12 Rules for Life became a 
success, and during the extensive speaking tour that followed, 
Tammy and I were close to people with whom we could share our 
good fortune. These were friends and family members genuinely 
pleased with what was happening and following the events of our 
lives avidly, and who were willing to discuss what could have been 
the overwhelming public response. This greatly heightened the 
significance and meaning of everything we were doing and reduced 
the isolation that such a dramatic shift in life circumstances, for 
better or worse, is likely to produce. 

The relationships established with colleagues of similar status at 
work constitute another important source of peer regulation, in 
addition to friendship. To maintain good relationships with your 
colleagues means, among other things, to give credit where credit is 
due; to take your fair share of the jobs no one wants but still must 
be done; to deliver on time and in a high-quality manner when 
teamed with other people; to show up when expected; and, in 
general, to be trusted to do somewhat more than your job formally 
requires. The approval or disapproval of your colleagues rewards 
and enforces this continual reciprocity, and that—like the 
reciprocity that is necessarily part of friendship—helps maintain 
stable psychological function. It is much better to be someone who 
can be relied upon, not least so that during times of personal 
trouble the people you have worked beside are willing and able to 
step in and help. 

Through friendship and collegial relationships we modify our 
selfish proclivities, learning not to always put ourselves first. Less 
obviously, but just as importantly, we may also learn to overcome 
our naive and too empathic proclivities (our tendency to sacrifice 
ourselves unsuitably and unjustly to predatory others) when our 
peers advise and encourage us to stand up for ourselves. In 
consequence, if we are fortunate, we begin to practice true 
reciprocity, and we gain at least some of the advantage spoken about 
so famously by the poet Robert Burns: 


O wad some Pow’r the giftie gie us 

To see oursels as ithers see us! 

It wad frae mony a blunder free us, 

An’ foolish notion: 

What airs in dress an’ gait wad lea’e us, 
An’ ev’n devotion!*2 


TOP DOG 


It is a good thing to be an authority. People are fragile. Because of 
that, life is difficult and suffering common. Ameliorating that 
suffering—ensuring that everyone has food, clean water, sanitary 
facilities, and a place to take shelter, for starters—takes initiative, 
effort, and ability. If there is a problem to be solved, and many 
people involve themselves in the solution, then a hierarchy must 
and will arise, as those who can do, and those who cannot follow as 
best they can, often learning to be competent in the process. If the 
problem is real, then the people who are best at solving the problem 
at hand should rise to the top. That is not power. It is the authority 
that properly accompanies ability. 

Now, it is self-evidently appropriate to grant power to competent 
authorities, if they are solving necessary problems; and it is equally 
appropriate to be one of those competent authorities, if possible, 
when there is a perplexing problem at hand. This might be regarded 
as a philosophy of responsibility. A responsible person decides to 
make a problem his or her problem, and then works diligently— 
even ambitiously—for its solution, with other people, in the most 
efficient manner possible (efficient, because there are other 
problems to solve, and efficiency allows for the conservation of 
resources that might then be devoted importantly elsewhere). 

Ambition is often—and often purposefully—misidentified with 
the desire for power, and damned with faint praise, and denigrated, 
and punished. And ambition is sometimes exactly that wish for 
undue influence on others. But there is a crucial difference between 
sometimes and always. Authority is not mere power, and it is 


extremely unhelpful, even dangerous, to confuse the two. When 
people exert power over others, they compel them, forcefully. They 
apply the threat of privation or punishment so their subordinates 
have little choice but to act in a manner contrary to their personal 
needs, desires, and values. When people wield authority, by 
contrast, they do so because of their competence—a competence 
that is spontaneously recognized and appreciated by others, and 
generally followed willingly, with a certain relief, and with the sense 
that justice is being served. 

Those who are power hungry—tyrannical and cruel, even 
psychopathic—desire control over others so that every selfish whim 
of hedonism can be immediately gratified; so that envy can destroy 
its target; so that resentment can find its expression. But good 
people are ambitious (and diligent, honest, and focused along with 
it) instead because they are possessed by the desire to solve 
genuine, serious problems. That variant of ambition needs to be 
encouraged in every possible manner. It is for this reason, among 
many others, that the increasingly reflexive identification of the 
striving of boys and men for victory with the “patriarchal tyranny” 
that hypothetically characterizes our modern, productive, and 
comparatively free societies is so stunningly counterproductive 
(and, it must be said, cruel: there is almost nothing worse than 
treating someone striving for competence as a tyrant in training). 
“Victory,” in one of its primary and most socially important aspects, 
is the overcoming of obstacles for the broader public good. Someone 
who is sophisticated as a winner wins in a manner that improves 
the game itself, for all the players. To adopt an attitude of naive or 
willfully blind cynicism about this, or to deny outright that it is true, 
is to position yourself—perhaps purposefully, as people have many 
dark motives—as an enemy of the practical amelioration of 
suffering itself. I can think of few more sadistic attitudes. 

Now, power may accompany authority, and perhaps it must. 
However, and more important, genuine authority constrains the 
arbitrary exercise of power. This constraint manifests itself when 
the authoritative agent cares, and takes responsibility, for those 
over whom the exertion of power is possible. The oldest child can 


take accountability for his younger siblings, instead of domineering 
over and teasing and torturing them, and can learn in that manner 
how to exercise authority and limit the misuse of power. Even the 
youngest can exercise appropriate authority over the family dog. To 
adopt authority is to learn that power requires concern and 
competence—and that it comes at a genuine cost. Someone newly 
promoted to a management position soon learns that managers are 
frequently more stressed by their multiple subordinates than 
subordinates are stressed by their single manager. Such experience 
moderates what might otherwise become romantic but dangerous 
fantasies about the attractiveness of power, and helps quell the 
desire for its infinite extension. And, in the real world, those who 
occupy positions of authority in functional hierarchies are generally 
struck to the core by the responsibility they bear for the people they 
supervise, employ, and mentor. 

Not everyone feels this burden, of course. A person who has 
become established as an authority can forget his origins and come 
to develop a counterproductive contempt for the person who is just 
starting out. This is a mistake, not least because it means that the 
established person cannot risk doing something new (as it would 
mean adopting the role of despised fool). It is also because 
arrogance bars the path to learning. Shortsighted, willfully blind, 
and narrowly selfish tyrants certainly exist, but they are by no 
means in the majority, at least in functional societies. Otherwise 
nothing would work. 

The authority who remembers his or her sojourn as voluntary 
beginner, by contrast, can retain their identification with the 
newcomer and the promise of potential, and use that memory as the 
source of personal information necessary to constrain the hunger 
for power. One of the things that has constantly amazed me is the 
delight that decent people take in the ability to provide 
opportunities to those over whom they currently exercise authority. 
I have experienced this repeatedly: personally, as a university 
professor and researcher (and observed many other people in my 
situation doing the same); and in the business and other 
professional settings I have become familiar with. There is great 


intrinsic pleasure in helping already competent and admirable 
young people become highly skilled, socially valuable, autonomous, 
responsible professionals. It is not unlike the pleasure taken in 
raising children, and it is one of the primary motivators of valid 
ambition. Thus, the position of top dog, when occupied properly, 
has as one of its fundamental attractions the opportunity to identify 
deserving individuals at or near the beginning of their professional 
life, and provide them with the means of productive advancement. 


SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NECESSARY—BUT 
INSUFFICIENT 


Sanity is knowing the rules of the social game, internalizing them, 
and following them. Differences in status are therefore inevitable, 
as all worthwhile endeavors have a goal, and those who pursue 
them have different abilities in relationship to that goal. Accepting 
the fact of this disequilibrium and striving forward nonetheless— 
whether presently at the bottom, middle, or top—is an important 
element of mental health. But a paradox remains. The solutions of 
yesterday and today, upon which our current hierarchies depend, 
will not necessarily serve as solutions tomorrow. Thoughtless 
repetition of what sufficed in the past—or, worse, authoritarian 
insistence that all problems have been permanently solved— 
therefore means the introduction of great danger when changes in 
the broader world makes local change necessary. Respect for 
creative transformation must in consequence accompany 
appropriate regard for the problem-solving hierarchical structures 
bequeathed to us by the past. That is neither an arbitrary moral 
opinion nor a morally relative claim. It is something more akin to 
knowledge of twin natural laws built into the structure of our 
reality. Highly social creatures such as we are must abide by the 
rules, to remain sane and minimize unnecessary uncertainty, 
suffering, and strife. However, we must also transform those rules 
carefully, as circumstances change around us. 


This implies, as well, that the ideal personality cannot remain an 
unquestioning reflection of the current social state. Under normal 
conditions, it may be nonetheless said that the ability to conform 
unquestioningly trumps the inability to conform. However, the 
refusal to conform when the social surround has become 
pathological—incomplete, archaic, willfully blind, or corrupt—is 
something of even higher value, as is the capacity to offer creative, 
valid alternatives. This leaves all of us with a permanent moral 
conundrum: When do we simply follow convention, doing what 
others request or demand; and when do we rely on our own 
individual judgment, with all its limitations and biases, and reject 
the requirements of the collective? In other words: How do we 
establish a balance between reasonable conservatism and 
revitalizing creativity? 

First and foremost on the psychological front is the issue of 
temperament. Some people are temperamentally predisposed to 
conservatism, and others to more liberal creative perception and 
action.+ This does not mean that socialization has no ability to alter 
that predisposition; human beings are very plastic organisms, with a 
long period of preadult development, and the circumstances we find 
ourselves in can change us very drastically. That does not alter the 
fact, however, that there are relatively permanent niches in the 
human environment to which different modes of temperament have 
adapted to fill. 

Those who tend toward the right, politically, are staunch 
defenders of all that has worked in the past. And much of the time, 
they are correct in being so, because of the limited number of 
pathways that produce personal success, social harmony, and long- 
term stability. But sometimes they are wrong: first, because the 
present and the future differ from the past; second, because even 
once-functional hierarchies typically (inevitably?) fall prey to 
internal machinations in a manner that produces their downfall. 
Those who rise to the top can do so through manipulation and the 
exercise of unjust power, acting in a manner that works only for 
them, at least in the short term; but that kind of ascendance 
undermines the proper function of the hierarchy they are nominally 


part of. Such people generally fail to understand or do not care what 
function the organization they have made their host was designed to 
fulfill. They extract what they can from the riches that lie before 
them and leave a trail of wreckage in their wake. 

It is this corruption of power that is strongly objected to by those 
on the liberal/left side of the political spectrum, and rightly so. But 
it is critically important to distinguish between a hierarchy that is 
functional and productive (and the people who make it so) and the 
degenerate shell of a once-great institution. Making that distinction 
requires the capacity and the willingness to observe and 
differentiate, rather than mindless reliance on ideological proclivity. 
It requires knowing that there is a bright side to the social 
hierarchies we necessarily inhabit, as well as a dark (and the 
realization that concentrating on one to the exclusion of the other is 
dangerously biased). It also requires knowledge that on the more 
radical, creative side—the necessary source of revitalization for what 
has become immoral and outdated—there also lurks great danger. 
Part of the danger is that very tendency of those who think more 
liberally to see only the negative in well-founded institutions. The 
further danger stems from the counterpart to the corrupt but 
conservative processes that destabilize and destroy functional 
hierarchies: there are unethical radicals, just as there are crooked 
administrators, managers, and executives. These individuals tend to 
be profoundly ignorant of the complex realities of the status quo, 
unconscious of their own ignorance, and ungrateful for what the 
past has bequeathed to them. Such ignorance and ingratitude are 
often conjoined with the willingness to use tired clichés of cynicism 
to justify refusal to engage either in the dull but necessary rigors of 
convention or the risks and difficulties of truly generative endeavor. 
It is this corruption of creative transformation that renders the 
conservative—and not only the conservative—appropriately cautious 
of change. 

A few years before writing this, I had a discussion with a young 
woman in her early twenties—the niece of someone who emailed 
me after watching some of my online lectures. She appeared 
severely unhappy, and said that she had spent much of the past six 


months lying in bed. She came to talk to me because she was 
becoming desperate. The only thing that stood between her and 
suicide, as far as she was concerned, was the responsibility she still 
maintained for an exotic pet, a serval cat. This was the last 
remaining manifestation of an interest in biology that once gripped 
her, but which she abandoned, much to her current regret, when 
she dropped out of high school. She had not been well attended to 
by her parents, who had allowed her to drift in the manner that had 
become disastrous over the span of several years. 

Despite her decline, she had formulated a bit of a plan. She said 
she had thought about enrolling in a two-year program that would 
enable her to finish high school, as a prerequisite for applying to a 
veterinary college. But she had not made the necessary detailed 
inquiries into what would be required to carry out this ambition. 
She lacked a mentor. She had no good friends. It was far too easy for 
her to remain inactive and disappear into her isolation. We had a 
good conversation, for about three quarters of an hour. She was a 
nice kid. I offered to discuss her future in more detail if she would 
complete an online planning program designed by my professorial 
colleagues and me.* 

All was going well until the discussion twisted toward the 
political. After discussing her personal situation, she began to voice 
her discontent with the state of the world at large—with the looming 
catastrophe, in her opinion, of the effects of human activity on the 
environment. Now, there is nothing wrong, in principle, with the 
expression of concern for planet-wide issues. That is not the point. 
There is something wrong, however, with overestimating your 
knowledge of such things—or perhaps even considering them— 
when you are a mid-twenty-year-old with nothing positive going on 
in your life and you are having great difficulty even getting out of 
bed. Under those conditions, you need to get your priorities straight, 
and establishing the humility necessary to attend to and solve your 
own problems is a crucial part of doing just that. 

As the verbal exchange continued, I found myself no longer 
engaged in a genuine conversation with a lost young woman who 
had come to speak with me. Instead, I became a hypothetically 


equal partner in a debate with an ideologue who knew what was 
wrong, globally speaking; who knew who was at fault for those 
global problems; who knew that participating in the continuing 
destruction by manifesting any personal desire whatsoever was 
immoral; and who believed, finally, that we were all both guilty and 
doomed. Continuing the conversation at that point meant I was (1) 
speaking not with this young woman so much as with whatever or 
whomever took possession of her while in the grip of generic, 
impersonal, and cynical ideas, and (2) implying that discussion of 
such topics under the circumstances was both acceptable and 
productive. 

There was no point in either outcome. So, I stopped (which did 
not mean that the entire meeting had been a waste). It was 
impossible for me not to conclude that some of what had reduced 
her to her monthslong state of moral paralysis was not so much 
guilt about potentially contributing to the negative effects of human 
striving on the broader world, as it was the sense of moral 
superiority that concern about such things brought her (despite the 
exceptional psychological danger of embracing this dismal view of 
human possibility). Excuse the cliché, but it is necessary to walk 
before you can run. You may even have to crawl before you can 
walk. This is part of accepting your position as a beginner, at the 
bottom of the hierarchy you so casually, arrogantly, and self- 
servingly despise. Furthermore, the deeply antihuman attitude that 
often accompanies tears shed for environmental degradation and 
man’s inhumanity to man cannot but help but have a marked effect 
on the psychological attitude that defines a person’s relationship to 
him or herself. 

It has taken since time immemorial for us to organize ourselves, 
biologically and socially, into the functional hierarchies that both 
specify our perceptions and actions, and define our interactions 
with the natural and social world. Profound gratitude for that gift is 
the only proper response. The structure that encompasses us all has 
its dark side—just as nature does, just as each individual does—but 
that does not mean careless, generic, and self-serving criticism of 


the status quo is appropriate (any more than knee-jerk objection to 
what might be necessary change). 


THE NECESSITY OF BALANCE 


Because doing what others do and have always done so often works, 
and because, sometimes, radical action can produce success beyond 
measure, the conservative and the creative attitudes and actions 
constantly propagate themselves. A functional social institution—a 
hierarchy devoted to producing something of value, beyond the 
mere insurance of its own survival—can utilize the conservative 
types to carefully implement processes of tried-and-true value, and 
the creative, liberal types to determine how what is old and out of 
date might be replaced by something new and more valuable. The 
balance between conservatism and originality might therefore be 
properly struck, socially, by bringing the two types of persons 
together. But someone must determine how best to do that, and 
that requires a wisdom that transcends mere temperamental 
proclivity. Because the traits associated with creativity, on the one 
hand, and comfort with the status quo, on the other, tend to be 
mutually exclusive, it is difficult to find a single person who has 
balanced both properly, who is therefore comfortable working with 
each type, and who can attend, in an unbiased manner, to the 
necessity for capitalizing on the respective forms of talent and 
proclivity. But the development of that ability can at least begin with 
an expansion of conscious wisdom: the articulated realization that 
conservatism is good (with a set of associated dangers), and that 
creative transformation—even of the radical sort—is also good (with 
a set of associated dangers). Learning this deeply—truly 
appreciating the need for both viewpoints—means at least the 
possibility of valuing what truly diverse people have to offer, and of 
being able to recognize when the balance has swung too far in one 
direction. The same is true of the knowledge of the shadow side of 
both. To manage complex affairs properly, it is necessary to be cold 
enough in vision to separate the power hungry and self-serving 


pseudoadvocate of the status quo from the genuine conservative; 
and the self-deceptive, irresponsible rebel without a cause from the 
truly creative. And to manage this means to separate those factors 
within the confines of one’s own soul, as well as among other 
people. 

And how might this be accomplished? First, we might come to 
understand consciously that these two modes of being are integrally 
interdependent. One cannot truly exist without the other, although 
they exist in genuine tension. This means, first, for example, that 
discipline—subordination to the status quo, in one form or another 
—needs to be understood as a necessary precursor to creative 
transformation, rather than its enemy. Thus, just as the hierarchy of 
assumptions that make up the structure that organizes society and 
individual perceptions is shaped by, and integrally dependent on, 
restrictions, so too is creative transformation. It must strain against 
limits. It has no use and cannot be called forth unless it is struggling 
against something. It is for this reason that the great genie, the 
granter of wishes—God, in a microcosm—is archetypally trapped in 
the tiny confines of a lamp and subject, as well, to the will of the 
lamp’s current holder. Genie—genius—is the combination of 
possibility and potential, and extreme constraint. 

Limitations, constraints, arbitrary boundaries—rules, dread rules, 
themselves—therefore not only ensure social harmony and 
psychological stability, they make the creativity that renews order 
possible. What lurks, therefore, under the explicitly stated desire for 
complete freedom—as expressed, say, by the anarchist, or the 
nihilist—is not a positive desire, striving for enhanced creative 
expression, as in the romanticized caricature of the artist. It is 
instead a negative desire—a desire for the complete absence of 
responsibility, which is simply not commensurate with genuine 
freedom. This is the lie of objections to the rules. But “Down with 
Responsibility” does not make for a compelling slogan—being 
sufficiently narcissistic to negate itself self-evidently—while the 
corresponding “Down with the Rules” can be dressed up like a 
heroic corpse. 


Alongside the wisdom of true conservatism is the danger that the 
status quo might become corrupt and its corruption self-servingly 
exploited. Alongside the brilliance of creative endeavor is the false 
heroism of the resentful ideologue, who wears the clothes of the 
original rebel while undeservedly claiming the upper moral hand 
and rejecting all genuine responsibility. Intelligent and cautious 
conservatism and careful and incisive change keep the world in 
order. But each has its dark aspect, and it is crucial, once this has 
been realized, to pose the question to yourself: Are you the real 
thing, or its opposite? And the answer is, inevitably, that you are 
some of both—and perhaps far more of what is shadowy than you 
might like to realize. That is all part of understanding the 
complexity we each carry within us. 


PERSONALITY AS HIERARCHY—AND CAPACITY FOR 
TRANSFORMATION 


How, then, is the personality that balances respect for social 
institutions and, equally, creative transformation to be understood? 
It is not so easy to determine, given the complexity of the problem. 
For that reason, we turn to stories. Stories provide us with a broad 
template. They outline a pattern specific enough to be of 
tremendous value, if we can imitate it, but general enough (unlike a 
particular rule or set of rules) to apply even to new situations. In 
stories, we capture observations of the ideal personality. We tell 
tales about success and failure in adventure and romance. Across 
our narrative universes, success moves us forward to what is better, 
to the promised land; failure dooms us, and those who become 
entangled with us, to the abyss. The good moves us upward and 
ahead, and evil drags us backward and down. Great stories are about 
characters in action, and so they mirror the unconscious structures 
and processes that help us translate the intransigent world of facts 
into the sustainable, functional, reciprocal social world of values.* 


The properly embodied hierarchy of values—including the value 
of conservatism and its twin, creative transformation—finds its 
expression as a personality, in narrative—an ideal personality. Every 
hierarchy has something at its pinnacle. It is for this reason that a 
story, which is a description of the action of a personality, has a 
hero (and even if that someone is the antihero, it does not matter: 
the antihero serves the function of identifying the hero through 
contrast, as the hero is what the antihero is most decidedly not). 
The hero is the individual at the peak, the victor, the champion, the 
wit, the eventually successful and deserving underdog, the speaker 
of truth under perilous circumstances, and more. The stories we 
create, watch, listen to, and remember center themselves on actions 
and attitudes we find interesting, compelling, and worthy of 
communication as a consequence of our personal experience with 
both admirable and detestable people (or fragments of their specific 
attitudes and actions), or because of our proclivity to share what has 
gripped our attention with those who surround us. Sometimes we 
can draw compelling narratives directly from our personal 
experience with individual people; sometimes we create amalgams 
of multiple personalities, often in concert with those who compose 
our social groups. 

The client whose story was told in part earlier had a life usefully 
employed as an example of the necessity of social engagement. That 
tale did not, however, exhaust the significance of his transformed 
attitudes and actions. While he was reconstructing his social life, 
becoming an active participant in a range of collective activities, he 
simultaneously developed a certain creative expertise that was 
equally unexpected. He had not benefited from formal education 
beyond the high school level, and did not have a personality that 
immediately struck the external observer as markedly creative. 
However, the personally novel social pursuits that attracted him 
were in the main oriented toward aesthetic endeavor. 

He first developed his eye for form, symmetry, novelty, and 
beauty as a photographer. The social advantages of this pursuit were 
manifold: he joined a club that had its members attend biweekly 
photography walks, where they would sojourn as a group of twenty 


or so to parts of the city that were visually interesting, either for 
their natural beauty or uniqueness or for the attraction they held as 
industrial landscapes. He learned a fair bit about photographic 
equipment, technically, because of doing so. The group members 
also critiqued one another’s work—and they did this constructively, 
which meant that all of them appeared to indicate what errors had 
been made but also what of value had been managed. 

This all helped my client learn to communicate in a productive 
manner about topics that might otherwise have been 
psychologically difficult (touching as they did on criticisms that, 
because of their association with creative vision, could easily have 
generated counterproductively sensitive overreactions) and, as well, 
to increasingly distinguish between visual images that were trite or 
dull or conformist and those of genuine quality. After a few months, 
his perception had developed sufficiently so that he began to win 
local contests and generate small professional commissions. I had 
believed from the beginning that his participation in the 
photography club was well advised from the perspective of 
personality development, but I was genuinely struck by the rapid 
development of his visual and technical ability and very much 
enjoyed the times we spent in our sessions reviewing his work. 

After a few months of work on the photography front, my client 
began to produce and to show me other images he had created, as 
well—which were in their first incarnation decidedly amateurish 
abstract line drawings done in pen. These essentially consisted of 
loops of various sizes, joined continuously, on a single page: 
scribbles, really, although more controlled and evidently purposeful 
than mere scribbles. As I had with the photographs (and the 
photography club), I regarded these as psychologically useful—as an 
extension of creative ability—but not as worthwhile artistic 
endeavors in their own right. He kept at it, however, generating 
several drawings a week, all the while bringing what he had created 
to our sessions. What he produced increased in sophistication and 
beauty with dramatic rapidity. Soon, he was drawing complex, 
symmetrical, and rather dramatic black-and-white pen-and-ink 


drawings of sufficient intrinsic beauty to serve as commercially 
viable T-shirt designs. 

I had seen this sort of development clearly in the case of two 
other clients, both characterized by intrinsically creative 
temperaments (very well hidden in one of the cases; more 
developed, nurtured, and obvious in the other). In addition, I had 
read accounts of clinical cases and personal development by Carl 
Jung, who noted that the production of increasingly ordered and 
complex geometrical figures—often circles within squares, or the 
reverse—regularly accompanied an increase in organization of the 
personality. This certainly seemed true not only of my client, as 
evidenced by his burgeoning expertise at photography and the 
development of his skill as a graphic artist, but also of the two 
others I had the pleasure of serving as a clinical therapist. What I 
observed repeatedly was, therefore, not only the reconstruction of 
the psyche as a consequence of further socialization (and the 
valuation of social institutions) but the parallel transformation of 
primarily interior processes, indicated by a marked increase in the 
capacity to perceive and to create what was elegant, beautiful, and 
socially valued. My clients had learned not only to submit properly 
to the sometimes arbitrary but still necessary demands of the social 
world, but to offer to that world something it would not have had 
access to had it not been for their private creative work. 

My granddaughter, Scarlett, also came to exhibit behaviors that 
were indicative of, if not her creative ability, then at least her 
appreciation for creative ability, in addition to her socialization as 
an agent of socially valued pointing. When people discuss a story— 
presented as a movie, or a play, or a book—they commonly attempt 
to come to a sophisticated consensus about its point (sophisticated 
because a group of people can generally offer more viewpoints than 
a single individual; consensus because the discussion usually 
continues until some broad agreement is reached as to the topic at 
hand). Now, the idea that a story is a form of communication—and 
entertainment—is one of those facts that appears self-evident upon 
first consideration, but that becomes more mysterious the longer it 
is pondered. If it is true that a story has a point, then it is clear that 


it is pointing to something. But what, and how? What constitutes 
pointing is obvious when it is an action specifying a particular thing, 
or a person by a particular person, but much less obvious when it is 
something typifying the cumulative behavior, shall we say, of a 
character in a story. 

The actions and attitudes of J. K. Rowling’s heroes and heroines 
once again provide popular examples of precisely this process. Harry 
Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger are typified in large 
part by the willingness and ability to follow rules (indicating their 
expertise as apprentices) and, simultaneously, to break them. While 
those who supervise them are inclined, equally, to reward both 
apparently paradoxical forms of behavior. Even the technologies 
used by the young wizards during their apprenticeship are 
characterized by this duality. The Marauder’s Map, for example 
(which provides its bearer with an accurate representation of 
explored territory in the form of the physical layout or geography of 
Hogwarts, the wizarding school, as well as the locale of all its living 
denizens), can be activated as a functional tool only by uttering a set 
of words that seem to indicate the very opposite of moral behavior: 
“T solemnly swear that I am up to no good,” and deactivated, so that 
its function remains secret, with the phrase “Mischief managed.” 

It is no easy matter to understand how an artifact that requires 
such statements to make it usable could possibly be anything but 
“no good’”—a tool of evil purpose, apparently. But, like the fact that 
Harry and his friends regularly but carefully break rules, and are 
equally regularly and carefully rewarded for doing so, the 
Marauder’s Map varies in its ethical desirability with the intent of 
its users. There is a strong implication throughout the series that 
what is good cannot be simply encapsulated by mindless or rigid 
rule following, no matter how disciplined that following, or how 
vital the rules so followed. What this all means is that the Harry 
Potter series does not point to drone-like subservience to social 
order as the highest of moral virtues. What supersedes that 
obedience is not so obvious that it can be easily articulated, but it is 
something like “Follow rules except when doing so undermines the 
purpose of those selfsame rules—in which case take the risk of 


acting in a manner contrary to what has been agreed upon as 
moral.” This is a lesson that seems more easily taught by 
representations of the behaviors that embody it than transmitted 
by, say, rote learning or a variant rule. Meta-rules (which might be 
regarded as rules about rules, rather than rules themselves) are not 
necessarily communicated in the same manner as simple rules 
themselves. 

Scarlett, with her emphasis on pointing, learned soon after 
mastering the comparatively straightforward physical act, to grasp 
the more complex point of narratives. She could signify something 
with her index finger at the age of a year and a half. By two and a 
half years, however, she could understand and imitate the far more 
intricate point of a story. For a period of approximately six months, 
at the latter age, she would insist, when asked, that she was 
Pocahontas, rather than Ellie (the name preferred by her father) or 
Scarlett (preferred by her mother). This was a staggering act of 
sophisticated thought, as far as I was concerned. She had been given 
a Pocahontas doll, which became one of her favorite toys, along with 
a baby doll (also very well loved), who she named after her 
grandmother, my wife, Tammy. When she played with the infant 
doll, Ellie was the mother. With Pocahontas, however, the situation 
differed. That doll was not a baby, and Ellie was not its mother. My 
granddaughter regarded herself, instead, as the grown Pocahontas— 
mimicking the doll, which was fashioned like a young woman, as 
well as the character who served as the lead in the Disney movie of 
the same name, which she had raptly observed on two separate 
occasions. 

The Disney Pocahontas bore marked similarities to the main 
protagonists of the Harry Potter series. She finds herself promised 
by her father to Kocoum, a brave warrior who embodies, in all 
seriousness, the virtues of his tribe, but whose behavior and 
attitudes are too rule bound for the more expansive personality of 
his bride-to-be. Pocahontas falls in love, instead, with John Smith, 
captain of a ship from Europe and representative of that which falls 
outside of known territory but is (potentially) of great value. 
Paradoxically, Pocahontas is pursuing a higher moral order in 


rejecting Kocoum for Smith—breaking a profoundly important rule 
(value what is most valued in the current culture’s hierarchy of 
rules)—very much in the same manner as the primary Potter 
characters. That is the moral of both narratives: follow the rules 
until you are capable of being a shining exemplar of what they 
represent, but break them when those very rules now constitute the 
most dire impediment to the embodiment of their central virtues. 
And Elizabeth Scarlett, not yet three years of age, had the intrinsic 
wisdom to see this as the point of what she was watching (the 
Disney movie) and using as a role-playing aid (the doll Pocahontas). 
Her perspicacity in this regard bordered on the unfathomable. 

The same set of ideas—respect for the rules, except when 
following those rules means disregarding or ignoring or remaining 
blind to an even higher moral principle—is represented with 
stunning power in two different Gospel narratives (which serve, 
regardless of your opinion about them, as central traditional or 
classical stories portraying a personality for the purposes of evoking 
imitation). In the first, Christ is presented, even as a child, as a 
master of the Jewish tradition. This makes him fully informed as to 
the value of the past, and portrays him as characterized by the 
respect typical, say, of the genuine conservative. According to the 
account in Luke 2:42—52,* Jesus’s family journeyed to Jerusalem 
every year at the Jewish holiday of Passover: 


And when he was twelve years old, they went up to 
Jerusalem after the custom of the feast. 

And when they had fulfilled the days, as they returned, 
the child Jesus tarried behind in Jerusalem; and Joseph 
and his mother knew not of it. 

But they, supposing him to have been in the company, 
went a day’s journey; and they sought him among their 
kinsfolk and acquaintance. 

And when they found him not, they turned back again 
to Jerusalem, seeking him. 


And it came to pass, that after three days they found 
him in the temple, sitting in the midst of the doctors, both 
hearing them, and asking them questions. 

And all that heard him were astonished at his 
understanding and answers. 

And when they saw him, they were amazed: and his 
mother said unto him, Son, why hast thou thus dealt with 
us? behold, thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing. 

And he said unto them, How is it that ye sought me? 
wist ye not that I must be about my Father’s business? 

And they understood not the saying which he spake 
unto them. 

And he went down with them, and came to Nazareth, 
and was subject unto them: but his mother kept all these 
sayings in her heart. 

And Jesus increased in wisdom and stature, and in 
favour with God and man. 


A paradox emerges, however, as the entirety of the Gospel 
accounts are considered—one closely associated with the tension 
between respect for tradition and the necessity for creative 
transformation. Despite the evidence of His thorough and even 
precocious understanding and appreciation of the rules, the adult 
Christ repeatedly and scandalously violates the Sabbath traditions— 
at least from the standpoint of the traditionalists in His community, 
and much to His own peril. He leads His disciples through a 
cornfield, for example, plucking and eating the grains (Luke 6:1). He 
justifies this to the Pharisees who object by referring to an account 
of King David acting in a similar manner, feeding his people when 
necessity demanded it on bread that was reserved for the priests 
(Luke 6:4). Christ tells his interlocutors quite remarkably “that the 
Son of man is Lord also of the sabbath” (Luke 6:5). 

An ancient document known as the Codex Bezae,* a noncanonical 
variant of part of the New Testament, offers an interpolation just 
after the section of the Gospel of Luke presented above, shedding 


profound light on the same issue. It offers deeper insight into the 
complex and paradoxical relationship between respect for the rules 
and creative moral action that is necessary and desirable, despite 
manifesting itself in apparent opposition to those rules. It contains 
an account of Christ addressing someone who, like Him, has broken 
a sacred rule: “On that same day, observing one working on the 
Sabbath, [Jesus] said to him O Man, if indeed thou knowest what 
thou doest, thou art blest; but if thou knowest not, thou art 
accursed, and a transgressor of the Law.”*= 

What does this statement mean? It sums up the meaning of Rule 
I perfectly. If you understand the rules—their necessity, their 
sacredness, the chaos they keep at bay, how they unite the 
communities that follow them, the price paid for their 
establishment, and the danger of breaking them—but you are 
willing to fully shoulder the responsibility of making an exception, 
because you see that as serving a higher good (and if you are a 
person with sufficient character to manage that distinction), then 
you have served the spirit, rather than the mere law, and that is an 
elevated moral act. But if you refuse to realize the importance of the 
rules you are violating and act out of self-centered convenience, 
then you are appropriately and inevitably damned. The carelessness 
you exhibit with regard to your own tradition will undo you and 
perhaps those around you fully and painfully across time. 

This is in keeping with other sentiments and acts of Christ 
described in the Gospels. Matthew 12:11 states: “And he said unto 
them, What man shall there be among you, that shall have one 
sheep, and if it fall into a pit on the Sabbath day, will he not lay hold 
on it, and lift it out?” Luke chapter 6 describes Him healing a man 
with a withered hand on another Sabbath, stating “It is lawful on 
the Sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or destroy 
it?” (Luke 6:9). This psychologically and conceptually painful 
juxtaposition of two moral stances (the keeping of the Sabbath 
versus the injunction to do good) is something else that constantly 
enrages the Pharisees, and is part of the series of events that 
eventually leads to Christ’s arrest and Crucifixion. These stories 
portray the existential dilemma that eternally characterizes human 


life: it is necessary to conform, to be disciplined, and to follow the 
rules—to do humbly what others do; but it is also necessary to use 
judgment, vision, and the truth that guides conscience to tell what is 
right, when the rules suggest otherwise. It is the ability to manage 
this combination that truly characterizes the fully developed 
personality: the true hero. 

A certain amount of arbitrary rule-ness must be tolerated—or 
welcomed, depending on your point of view—to keep the world and 
its inhabitants together. A certain amount of creativity and rebellion 
must be tolerated—or welcomed, depending on your point of view— 
to maintain the process of regeneration. Every rule was once a 
creative act, breaking other rules. Every creative act, genuine in its 
creativity, is likely to transform itself, with time, into a useful rule. 
It is the living interaction between social institutions and creative 
achievement that keeps the world balanced on the narrow line 
between too much order and too much chaos. This is a terrible 
conundrum, a true existential burden. We must support and value 
the past, and we need to do that with an attitude of gratitude and 
respect. At the same time, however, we must keep our eyes open— 
we, the visionary living—and repair the ancient mechanisms that 
stabilize and support us when they falter. Thus, we need to bear the 
paradox that is involved in simultaneously respecting the walls that 
keep us safe and allowing in enough of what is new and changing so 
that our institutions remain alive and healthy. The very world 
depends for its stability and its dynamism on the subsuming of all 
our endeavors under the perfection—the sacredness—of that dual 
ability. 

Do not carelessly denigrate social institutions or creative 
achievement.

RULE Il 


IMAGINE WHO YOU COULD BE, AND THEN AIM 
SINGLE-MINDEDLY AT THAT 


WHO ARE YOU—AND WHO COULD YOU BE? 


How do you know who you are? After all, you are complex beyond 
your own understanding; more complex than anything else that 
exists, excepting other people; complex beyond belief. And your 
ignorance is further complicated by the intermingling of who you 
are with who you could be. You are not only something that is. You 
are something that is becoming—and the potential extent of that 
becoming also transcends your understanding. Everyone has the 
sense, I believe, that there is more to them than they have yet 
allowed to be realized. That potential is often obscured by poor 
health, misfortune, and the general tragedies and mishaps of life. 
But it can also be hidden by an unwillingness to take full advantage 
of the opportunities that life offers—abetted by regrettable errors of 
all sorts, including failures of discipline, faith, imagination, and 
commitment. Who are you? And, more importantly, who could you 
be, if you were everything you could conceivably be? 

Are such questions impossible to answer, or are there sources 
available to us from which guidance might be derived? After all, we 
have been observing ourselves behave—in our successes and 
failures—for tens (perhaps hundreds) of thousands of years. During 
that time, our shamans, prophets, mystics, artists, poets, and bards 
have distilled something vital from such observations—some 
concentrated essence of what makes us human in actuality and 


possibility. In doing so, they have provided us with representations 
of that vital essence, presenting itself to us as that which can be 
neither ignored nor forgotten. Those creative people write and act 
out the dramas and tell us the stories that capture our imagination, 
and they fill our dreams with visions of what might be. The deepest 
and most profound of these are remembered, discussed, and 
otherwise honed collectively, and made the focus of rituals that 
unite us across the centuries, forming the very basis of our cultures. 
These are the stories upon which the ritual, religious, and 
philosophical edifices characterizing sophisticated, populous, 
successful societies are built. 

The stories we can neither ignore nor forget are unforgettable for 
this reason (among others): They speak to something we know, but 
do not know that we know. The ancient Greek philosopher Socrates 
believed that all learning was a form of remembering. Socrates 
posited that the soul, immortal in its essence, knew everything 
before it was born anew as an infant. However, at the point of birth 
all previous knowledge was forgotten and had to be recalled through 
the experiences of life. There is much to be said for this hypothesis, 
strange as it might now appear. There is much that we could do— 
much that our bodies and minds are capable of doing—that remains 
dormant, right down to the genetic level. Exposure to new 
experience activates this dormant potential, releasing abilities built 
into us over the vast span of our evolutionary history.* This is 
perhaps the most basic manner in which our bodies retain past 
wisdom and draw upon it when necessaty. It is in this way, although 
not only in this way, that human possibility exists. Thus, there is 
something profound to be said for the concept of learning as 
remembering. 

Obviously, as well as “remembering” (as in the turning on of 
innate but hidden possibilities), we can learn much that is new. This 
is one of the primary factors differentiating us from animals. Even 
complex and intelligent mammals such as chimpanzees and 
dolphins tend to repeat their species-typical behaviors generation 
after generation, with very little change. Humans, by contrast, can 
and continually do seek out and encounter what is new, investigate 


and adapt to it, and make it part of themselves. We can, as well, 
translate something we already know at one level of representation 
into knowledge at another. We can watch the actions of a living 
creature, animal or human, and then imitate them, translating our 
perceptions of their movement into new movements of our own. 
We can even generalize such imitative acts, catching the “spirit” of 
what or whom we are observing, and producing new ways of seeing 
and acting that are in some manner similar to that spirit.* This is 
part of what makes up the basis of the deeply embodied implicit 
knowledge that forms so much of the basis of our true 
understanding. We can also observe someone act or something 
occur and write down what we see, translating action into language 
that outlasts its utterance—and then communicate it later in the 
absence of what or whom is being described. Finally, and most 
mysteriously, we can imagine and then act out something that has 
simply not been seen before, something that is truly original. And 
we can code and represent all that ability—adaptive action and its 
transformation—in the stories we tell about those we admire, as 
well as those we hate. And that is how we determine who we are, 
and who we could perhaps become. 

Stories become unforgettable when they communicate 
sophisticated modes of being—complex problems and equally 
complex solutions—that we perceive, consciously, in pieces, but 
cannot fully articulate. It was for this reason, for example, that the 
biblical story of Moses and the Israelites’ exodus from Egypt 
became such a powerful touchstone for black slaves seeking 
emancipation in the United States: 


Go down, Moses, way down in Egypt land 
Tell old Pharaoh 
To let my people go. 


The biblical story of Exodus is properly regarded as archetypal (or 
paradigmatic or foundational) by psychoanalytic and religious 
thinkers alike, because it presents an example of psychological and 


social transformation that cannot be improved upon. It emerged as 
a product of imagination and has been transformed by constant 
collective retelling and reworking into an ultimately meaningful 
form that applies politically, economically, historically, personally, 
and spiritually, all at the same time. This is the very definition of 
literary depth—something that reaches its apogee in certain forms 
of ancient, traditional stories. The fact of that depth means that 
such accounts can be used diversely as a meaningful frame for any 
process of profound change experienced by any individual or society 
(stable state, descent into chaos, reestablishment of stability), and 
can lend that process multidimensional reality, context, powerful 
meaning, and motivation. 


THE EMERGENCE OF THE UNFORGETTABLE 


How might an unforgettable story come to be? What might precede 
its revelation? It is at the very least the consequence of a long 
period of observation. Imagine a scientist monitoring the behavior 
of a wolf pack, or a troop of chimps—indeed, any group of complex 
social animals. He or she attempts to identify regularities in the 
behavior of the individuals and the group (patterns, in a word) and 
to articulate those regularities—to encapsulate them in language. 
The scientist might first relate a series of anecdotes about animal 
actions emblematic of the general behavior of the species. He or she 
might then abstract even further, attempting to generalize across 
anecdotes with rule-like descriptions. I say “rule-like” because the 
animals are not following rules. Rules require language. Animals 
are merely acting out regularities. They cannot formulate, 
understand, or follow rules. 

But human beings? We can observe ourselves acting, as a 
scientist might—more accurately, as a storyteller might. Then we 
can tell the stories to each other. The stories are already distillations 
of observed behavior (if they are not distillations, they will not be 
interesting; relating a sequence of everyday actions does not make 
for a good story). Once the story is established, we can analyze it, 


looking for deeper patterns and regularities. If that analysis is 
successful, we can generalize across anecdotes with the formulation 
of rules, and then we can learn, consciously, to follow those rules. 
Here is how this might happen. We all react judgmentally when a 
child or adult—or, indeed, a society—is acting improperly, unfairly, 
or badly. The error strikes us emotionally. We intuit that a pattern 
upon which individual and social adaptation depends has been 
disrupted and violated. We are annoyed, frustrated, hurt, or grief- 
stricken at the betrayal. This does not mean that each of us, reacting 
emotionally, has been successful at articulating a comprehensive 
philosophy of good and evil. We may never put our finger on what 
has gone wrong. However, like children unfamiliar with a new game 
but still able to play it, we know that the rules are being broken. 
Something precisely like this is portrayed in the biblical story of 
Exodus, the ancient account of the flight of the Hebrew slaves from 
their Egyptian masters. Moses, who leads the escaping people, is 
continually called upon by his followers to draw very fine moral 
distinctions when they struggle with one another and seek his 
advice. In consequence, he spends a very long time observing and 
contemplating their behavior. It is as if the desert prophet had to 
discover what rules he and his Israelite followers were already 
struggling to act out, prior to his receipt of the explicit 
commandments from God. Remember: Every society is already 
characterized by patterned behavior; otherwise it would be pure 
conflict and no “society” at all. But the mere fact that social order 
reigns to some degree does not mean that a given society has come 
to explicitly understand its own behavior, its own moral code. It is 
therefore no accident that in this story Moses serves as a judge for 
his followers—and does so with sufficient duration and intensity to 
exhaust himself—before he receives the Ten Commandments: 


And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to 
judge the people: and the people stood by Moses from the 
morning unto the evening. 


And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to 
the people, he said, What is this thing that thou doest to 
the people? why sittest thou thyself alone, and all the 
people stand by thee from morning unto even? 

And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the 
people come unto me to inquire of God: 

When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I 
judge between one and another, and I do make them know 
the statutes of God, and his laws. 

And Moses’ father in law said unto him, The thing that 
thou doest is not good. 

Thou wilt surely wear away, both thou, and this people 
that is with thee: for this thing is too heavy for thee; thou 
art not able to perform it thyself alone. (Exodus 18: 13- 
18) 


This difficult exercise in discrimination and judgment, observing 
and weighing, is an integral part of what prepared the biblical 
patriarch for the receipt of divine revelation. If there had been no 
behavioral base for those rules—no historical precedent codified in 
traditional ethics, no conventions, and no endless hours of 
observation of the moral patterns—the commandments simply 
could not have been understood and communicated, much less 
obeyed. 

An unforgettable story captures the essence of humanity and 
distills, communicates, and clarifies it, bringing what we are and 
what we should be into focus. It speaks to us, motivating the 
attention that inspires us to imitate. We learn to see and act in the 
manner of the heroes of the stories that captivate us. These stories 
call to capacities that lie deep within our nature but might still 
never develop without that call. We are dormant adventurers, 
lovers, leaders, artists, and rebels, but need to discover that we are 
all those things by seeing the reflection of such patterns in dramatic 
and literary form. That is part of being a creature that is part nature 
and part culture. An unforgettable story advances our capacity to 


understand our behavior, beyond habit and expectation, toward an 
imaginative and then verbalized understanding. Such a story 
presents us in the most compelling manner with the ultimate 
adventure, the divine romance, and the eternal battle between good 
and evil. All this helps us clarify our understanding of moral and 
immoral attitude and action, personal and social. This can be seen 
everywhere, and always. 

Question: Who are you—or, at least, who could you be? Answer: 
Part of the eternal force that constantly confronts the terrible 
unknown, voluntarily; part of the eternal force that transcends 
naivete and becomes dangerous enough, in a controlled manner, to 
understand evil and beard it in its lair; and part of the eternal force 
that faces chaos and turns it into productive order, or that takes 
order that has become too restrictive, reduces it to chaos, and 
renders it productive once again. 

And all of this, being very difficult to understand consciously but 
vital to our survival, is transmitted in the form of the stories that we 
cannot help but attend to. And it is in this manner that we come to 
apprehend what is of value, what we should aim at, and what we 
could be. 


MATERIA PRIMA: WHO YOU COULD BE (1) 


I would like to try my hand at explaining the meaning of the 
illustration, based on an ancient alchemical woodcut, that opens 
this chapter. Describing what it signifies reveals how much 
information can be contained within an image without the viewer 
possessing any explicit understanding of its contents (such a picture 
is in fact better considered an early stage in the process by which 
such explicit understanding develops). The ancient alchemist* who 
produced the picture was dreaming, in a very real sense, while doing 
so—dreaming about what a person could be, and how that might 
come about. 

At the very base of the image is a winged sphere. Atop that 
perches a dragon. Standing on the dragon is a two-headed human 


figure—one head male, the other female. The male head is 
associated with an image of the Sun; the female, with the Moon. In 
between but also above the two heads is the symbol for Mercury: 
god, planet, and metal, simultaneously. A variety of additional 
symbols round out the picture. Everything portrayed is enveloped in 
an egg-shaped container. This arrangement indicates that the image 
is of many things inside one thing—a multiplicity in a unity—just as 
an unhatched chick is encapsulated within a single container but is 
many increasingly differentiated and complex biological parts, 
particularly in its later stages of development. In its entirety, the 
image is labeled materia prima—Latin for the “primal element.” 

The alchemists regarded the materia prima as the fundamental 
substance from which everything else—matter and spirit included, 
equally—emerged, or was derived. You can profitably consider that 
primal element the potential we face when we confront the future, 
including our future selves—or the potential we cannot help 
upbraiding ourselves and others for wasting. It can also be usefully 
conceptualized as the information from which we build ourselves 
and the world, instead of the matter out of which we generally 
consider reality composed. Each interpretation—potential and 
information—has its advantages. 

What does it mean that the world can be usefully considered as 
potential or information? Think about what happens, for example, 
when you stop by the mailbox and pick up your mail. Consider, as 
well, what that mail is “made of.” Materially speaking, it is merely 
paper and ink. But that material substrate is essentially irrelevant. It 
would not matter if the message was delivered by email or voice—or 
in Morse code, for that matter. What is relevant is the content. And 
that means that each piece of mail is a container of content—of 
potential or information, positive, neutral, or negative. Maybe, for 
example, it is a notification of investigation from your country’s tax 
department. This means that, despite its apparently harmless 
presence in your hand, the letter is tightly and inextricably 
connected to a gigantic, complex and oft-arbitrary structure that 
may well not have your best interests in mind. Alternatively, 
perhaps it is something joyful, such as an unexpected letter from 


someone loved or a long-awaited check. From such a perspective, an 
envelope is a container—a mysterious container, at least in potential 
—from which an entire new world might emerge. 

Everyone understands this idea, even if they do not know it. If 
you have been having trouble with the tax authorities, for example, 
and you receive an official piece of mail from their agency, your 
blood pressure will increase (or drop precipitously), your heart will 
pound, your palms will sweat, and a feeling of intense fear, even 
doom, may sweep over you. That is the instinctive response, 
associated with preparation for action, that accompanies exposure 
to danger. And now you will have to decide: are you going to open 
the letter and face what is “inside”? And, having done so, are you 
going to think your way through the problem, terrible as that might 
be, and begin to address it? Or are you going to ignore what you now 
know, pretend that everything is all right (even though you know, 
emotionally—as a consequence of your anxiety—that it is not), and 
pay the inevitable psychological and physical price? It is the former 
route that will require you to voluntarily confront what you are 
afraid of—the terrible, abstract monster—and, hypothetically, to 
become stronger and more integrated as a result. It is the latter 
route that will leave the problem in its monstrous form and force 
you to suffer like a scared animal confronted by a predator’s vicious 
eyes in the pitch of night. 

A winged sphere, inscribed with a square, a triangle, and the 
numerals 3 and 4 occupies the bottom third of the image in 
question.* This singular entity or object was known by the 
alchemists as the “round chaos.” It is a container—the initial 
container of the primordial element—the container of what the 
world, and the psyche, consists of before it becomes differentiated. 
This is the potential, or information. This is what attracts your 
attention unconsciously and compels you to attend to something 
before you know why it has gripped your interest. This is when and 
where what is new makes its entrance into what is predictable and 
certain (for better or worse); what flits about you, with little 
voluntary control—as if it is something winged—as your 
imagination and your attention move unpredictably but 


meaningfully from association to association; and it is what you are 
looking at when you have no idea what it is you are confronting. 
Finally, it is what you cannot look away from when you are 
possessed by horror, even as such potential for horror 
simultaneously adds vital interest to life. 

Strangely, the round chaos may be familiar to modern audiences 
(again, even if they do not know it), because of the Harry Potter 
series of books and films. J. K. Rowling, the series author, takes 
some pains to describe a sporting event, Quidditch, which helps to 
define and unify Hogwarts. The point of Quidditch is to drive a ball 
(the Quaffle) through one of the three hoops guarded by the 
opposing team, while flying about the playing pitch on enchanted 
brooms. Success in doing so gains the scorer’s team 10 points. 
Simultaneously, two separate players (one from each team) play 
another game—a game within the game. Chosen for their 
exceptional skill in attention and flight, these two competitors— 
known as Seekers—attempt to locate, chase, and capture a winged 
ball, the Snitch, which is identical in appearance to the round chaos 
that sits at the bottom of the alchemist’s image. The Snitch is 
golden—indicating its exceptional value and purity*—and zips 
around chaotically, at a very fast rate, darting, weaving, bobbing, and 
racing the Seekers as they pursue it astride their brooms. If a Seeker 
captures the Snitch, his or her team gains 150 points (typically 
enough to ensure victory) and the entire game comes to an end. 
This indicates that chasing and capturing whatever is represented by 
the Snitch—and, by implication, the round chaos—is a goal whose 
importance supersedes any other.* Why is Rowling’s game, 
conjured up for us by her deep imagination, structured in that 
manner? What does her narrative idea signify? There are two ways 
of answering these questions (although both answers relate 
importantly to each other): 

First: In Rule I, we discussed the idea that the true winner of any 
game is the person who plays fair. This is because playing fair, 
despite the particularities of any given game, is a higher-order 
accomplishment than mere victory. Striving to play fair, in the 
ultimate sense—following the spirit of the rules, as well as the letter 


—is an indication of true personality development, predicated as it is 
on concern for true reciprocity. The Seekers of the Snitch must 
ignore the details of the game of Quidditch, of which they are still a 
part, while attempting to find and seize the Snitch, just as the player 
of a real-world game must ignore the particularities of that game 
while attending to what constitutes truly ethical play, regardless of 
what is happening on the playing field. Thus, the ethical player, like 
the Seeker, indomitably pursues what is most valuable in the midst 
of complex, competing obligations. 

Second: Among the alchemists, the round chaos was associated 
with the winged god Mercury, who served as messenger from the 
realm of the divine, guide of souls to the underworld, and bringer of 
good fortune. It is for this reason that the ancient symbol for 
Mercury is located at the very pinnacle (the most important 
location) of the image in question. It is an attempt to indicate what 
guides the process that the picture represents. Centuries ago, prior 
to the dawn of modern chemistry, the god Mercury represented 
what inspires or attracts interest involuntarily. He was the spirit 
who possessed a person when his or her attention was drawn 
irresistibly to some person, situation, or event. Imagine that there 
are very complex processes going on in your mind unconsciously, 
highlighting events of potential worth and distinguishing them from 
everything else constantly unfolding around you. Imagine that 
those processes that distinguish value are alive, which is certainly 
the case, and that they are complex and integrated enough to be 
conceptualized as a personality. That is Mercury. The draw he exerts 
on our attention reveals itself in a sense of significance—in the 
sense that something happening around you is worth attending to, 
or contains something of value. The Seeker—in real life, as well as 
in Rowling’s Potter series and its Quidditch game—is he or she who 
takes that sense of significance more seriously than anything else. 
The Seeker is therefore the person who is playing the game that 
everyone else is playing (and who is disciplined and expert at the 
game), but who is also playing an additional, higher-order game: the 
pursuit of what is of primary significance. The Snitch (like the 
round chaos) can therefore be considered the “container” of that 


primary significance—that meaning—and, therefore, something 
revelatory when pursued and caught. We might in this context 
remember what has come to be known as the Golden Rule: “And as 
ye would that men should do to you, do ye also to them likewise” 
(Luke 6:31). There is nothing more important than learning to strive 
under difficult and frustrating circumstances to play fair. This is 
what should be chased, so to speak, during any game (even though 
it is also important to try to obtain victory in the game).* 

Each of us, when fortunate, is compelled forward by something 
that grips our attention—love of a person; a sport; a political, 
sociological, or economic problem, or a scientific question; a 
passion for art, literature, or drama—something that calls to us for 
reasons we can neither control nor understand (try to make yourself 
interested in something you just do not care about and see how well 
that works). The phenomena that grip us (phenomena: from the 
Greek word phainesthai, “to appear, or to be brought to light”) are 
like lamps along a dark path: they are part of the unconscious 
processes devoted to integrating and furthering the development of 
our spirits, the furtherance of our psychological development. You 
do not choose what interests you. It chooses you. Something 
manifests itself out of the darkness as compelling, as worth living 
for; following that, something moves us further down the road, to 
the next meaningful manifestation—and so it goes, as we continue 
to seek, develop, grow, and thrive. It is a perilous journey, but it is 
also the adventure of our lives. Think of pursuing someone you 
love: catch them or not, you change in the process. Think, as well, of 
the traveling you have done, or of the work you have undertaken, 
whether for pleasure or necessity. In all these cases you experience 
what is new. Sometimes that is painful; sometimes it is better than 
anything else that has ever happened to you. Either way, it is deeply 
informative. It is all part of the potential of the world, calling you 
into Being, changing you forever—for better or worse—in 
consequence of your pursuit. 

Atop the round chaos perches a dragon. This is because what is 
interesting and meaningful (and novel and unexpected, as those all 
go together) manifests itself in a form that is both dangerous and 


promising, particularly when its grip is intense and irresistible. The 
danger is, of course, signified by the presence of the immortal, 
predatory reptile; the promise is hinted at, as a dragon archetypally 
guards a great treasure. Thus, the drawing represents a 
psychological progression. First, you find yourself interested in 
something. That something (the round chaos) contains or is 
composed of potential, or information. If it is pursued and caught, it 
releases that information. Out of that information we build the 
world we perceive, and we build ourselves as perceivers. Thus, the 
round chaos is the container from which both matter (the world) 
and spirit (our psyches) emerge. There is some numerological 
indication of this on the spherical body of the round chaos itself: the 
number 3, accompanied by a triangle, which is traditionally 
associated with spirit (because of its association with the Holy 
Trinity), and the number 4, associated with the world of matter 
(because of its association with the four traditional elements: earth, 
water, wind, and fire). The dragon, in turn, perched on top of the 
round chaos, represents the danger and possibility of the 
information within. 

Atop the dragon stands a figure known as a Rebis, a single body 
with two heads, one male, one female. The Rebis is a symbol of the 
fully developed personality that can emerge from forthright and 
courageous pursuit of what is meaningful (the round chaos) and 
dangerous and promising (the dragon). It has a symbolically 
masculine aspect, which typically stands for exploration, order, and 
rationality (indicated by the Sun, which can be seen to the left of the 
male head), and a symbolically feminine aspect, which stands for 
chaos, promise, care, renewal, and emotion (indicated by the Moon, 
to the right of the female). In the course of normal socialization, it 
is typical for one of these aspects to become more developed than 
the other (as males are socialized in the male manner, to which they 
are also inclined biologically, and females in the female manner). 
Nonetheless, it is possible—with enough exploration, enough 
exposure to the round chaos and the dragon—to develop both 
elements. That constitutes an ideal—or so goes the alchemical 
intuition. 


Out of the unknown—the potential that makes up the world— 
comes the terrible but promising form of the dragon, peril and 
promise united. It is an eternal dichotomy echoed by the presence 
of the two remaining symbols to the right and above the dragon’s 
tail: Jupiter, representing the positive, and Saturn, the negative. Out 
of the confrontation with peril and promise emerges the masculine 
and feminine aspects of the psyche, working together in harmony. 
Guiding the process is the spirit Mercurius, manifesting itself as 
meaning in the world, working through unconscious means to 
attract exploration to what will unite the various discordant and 
warring elements of the personality. This can all be read, 
appropriately, as a story of the development of the ideal personality 
—an attempt, in image, to describe what each of us could be. 


POLYTHEISM INTO MONOTHEISM, AND THE 
EMERGENCE OF THE VIRTUOUS HERO: WHO YOU 
COULD BE (II) 


Now we are going to attempt a description of “who you could be” 
from another perspective, taken from one of the earliest stories we 
have been fortunate enough to rediscover. In the ancient 
Mesopotamian Enuma Elish (translation: When on High) we have 
the oldest near-complete hero myth known, estimated at four 
thousand years of age in its written form and, no doubt, far older as 
an oral tradition. The story begins when the primordial goddess 
Tiamat, embodiment of salt water (as well as a monstrous aquatic 
dragon), enters into sexual union with her equally primordial male 
consort, Apsu, the embodiment of fresh water. This union gives rise 
to the initial realm of being, inhabited by the elder gods, the first 
children of Tiamat and Apsu. 

To understand the beginning of this story, we need to know a few 
things the ancients held to be fundamentally true. These are 
markedly different from the truths of modern science. Before the 
dawn of the scientific worldview, a mere six hundred years ago, 


reality was construed as all that which human beings experience. 
That which we experience can be distinguished, conceptually, from 
reality as objective world—pure physical being—by its more 
comprehensive contents, which include subjective experiences such 
as emotions, dreams, visions, and motivational states such as 
hunger, thirst, and pain. That which we experience is better 
compared to a novel or a movie, which concentrates on the 
communication and sharing of subjective as well as objective states, 
than is reality as objective world, which we might liken to a 
scientific description of physical reality. It is the actual, particular, 
and unique demise of someone you love, for example, compared to 
the listing of that death in the hospital records. It is the drama of 
lived experience. It is because our own experience is genuinely 
literary, narrative, embodied, and storylike that we are so attracted 
to fictional representations. Movies, plays, operas, TV dramas—even 
the lyrics of songs—help us deal with our lived experiences, which 
are something different and broader than the mere material from 
which our experience hypothetically rises. 

Engaging with the first part of the Enuma Elish requires us to 
understand a second fundamental realization of the ancients: the 
fundamentally social nature of our cognitive categories. That is why 
everything is personified in children’s books: the Sun, the Moon, 
toys, animals—even machines. We see nothing strange in this, 
because it so profoundly mirrors our perceptual tendencies. We 
expect children to view and understand the world in this manner, 
and we can easily fall back into doing so ourselves. Something 
should be clarified here: It is not truly accurate to state that the 
reality portrayed in children’s fiction is personified. It is the case, 
instead (and this is a genuine reversal of the presumption in 
question), that we directly and naturally perceive reality as 
personified, and then must work very diligently to strip that 
personification away, so that we can detect “objective reality.”* We 
understand reality, therefore, as if it is constructed of personalities. 
That is because so much of what we encounter in our hypersocial 
reality, our complex societies, is in fact personality—and gendered 
personality, at that, reflecting the billion years or so since the 


emergence of sexual reproduction (ample time for its existence to 
have profoundly structured our perceptions). We understand male, 
and abstract from that the masculine. We understand female, and 
abstract from that the feminine. Finally, we understand the child, 
and abstract from that, most commonly, the son. These basic 
divisions are clearly reflected in the creation story of the Enuma 
Elish, just as they are reflected in, or more accurately underpin, our 
understanding of the stories we all know. 

Tiamat, the primordial goddess, is chaos, a female monster, a 
dragon. She is the terror of nature, creative and destructive, mother 
and slayer of us all. Apsu, her husband, is the eternal father. He is 
the order that we depend upon for security, and by which we are 
simultaneously tyrannized.* These two most primal of deities come 
together in a productive, sexual union, “mingling their waters,” in 
the ancient words. In this fashion, they produce their first progeny, 
the elder gods of Mesopotamia. These gods represent elements of 
the world more differentiated than the primordial mother and 
father—such as heaven and earth, mud and silt, and war and fire.* 
However, they are also careless, noisy, and impulsive as two-year- 
old children (who are, after all, primal forces in their own right). 
Their continual ceaseless, thoughtless activity and general 
unconsciousness culminates in a catastrophe: their mutual decision 
to wage war upon and then slay Apsu, and consequent attempt to 
build a stable dwelling place on his corpse. 

Tiamat—chaos itself—already irritated by the brainless racket of 
her children, is murderously enraged by the heedless slaughter of 
her husband. The Terrible Goddess builds an army of eleven 
monsters to deal with her wayward offspring, placing a demonic 
figure named Kingu, whom she takes as a second husband, at their 
head, and delivering to him the Tablet of Destinies (indicating his 
authority as ultimate ruler of the universe). The relationship 
between this brilliant dramatic representation and how we use, or 
misuse, the gifts of our culture is obvious: the careless demolition 
of tradition is the invitation to the (re)emergence of chaos. When 
ignorance destroys culture, monsters will emerge. 


While Tiamat busily arranges her army, the elder gods continue 
their activity, pairing off, producing children, and then 
grandchildren, of their own. One of the latter, Marduk, appears 
particularly talented, powerful, and promising. He is born with eyes 
encircling his head. He can see everywhere. He can speak magic 
words. He is something entirely new—and this is noted early by his 
progenitors. While Marduk matures, the elder gods are compelled to 
confront Tiamat, with whom they are now at war. One after another 
they attempt to defeat her. All return in abject failure. Finally, 
someone suggests that Marduk, though still young, should be sent 
to confront his terrible grandmother. Approached with this idea, he 
agrees, but only on the condition that he is awarded the right, 
henceforth—if he is victorious—to hold the Tablet of Destinies, and 
sit atop the dominance hierarchy of the gods. 

It is in this manner that this ancient story describes the 
emergence of monotheism out of polytheism. The Enuma Elish 
appears to be a dramatized account of the psychological or spiritual 
processes comprising this transformation. The ancient 
Mesopotamian civilization faced the necessity of incorporating and 
unifying many diverse tribes and peoples, each of whom had their 
own gods. The god who arose out of the conflict between all those 
gods (“Whose god is supreme?”) was, therefore, a meta-god—a god 
composed of what was most important about all gods. It was for 
such a reason, for example, that fifty different names characterized 
Marduk. This emergence of one from many is a very common 
process, described by the scholar of myth Mircea Eliade as the war 
of the gods in heaven, a typical mythological motif, as well as 
alluded to earlier.* It is the psychological counterpart, in the world 
of imagination, to the genuine struggle of concepts of divinity and 
value on earth. Tribes unite. Each has its gods. The people 
comprising these multitudinous groups go to war, concretely and 
conceptually, for what they believe—sometimes for generations. It 
is as if the gods they follow were battling for dominance over 
periods exceeding single human lives, using their followers as 
proxies. That is reflected in the ancient stories. If and when the gods 
come to an agreement about their relative positions—more 


particularly, if they arrange themselves into a hierarchy—it means 
that peace has genuinely been established, because peace is the 
establishment of a shared hierarchy of divinity, of value. Thus, an 
eternal question emerges whenever people of different backgrounds 
are required to deal with one another on a relatively permanent 
basis: What do all gods share that makes them gods? What is God, 
in essence? 

That is a very difficult question. It is, on the one hand, the 
question of value: What is of the highest importance? It is, on the 
other hand, the question of sovereignty: What principle should 
rule? These are the questions posed by those pondering the 
ultimate source of divine significance itself. Their difficulty meant 
that they, and by extension the question of God, had to be answered 
over centuries, over millennia. The answer emerged first in story 
form. The Mesopotamians brilliantly intuited that the highest god— 
the highest good—involved careful attention (the multiple, head- 
circling eyes of Marduk) and effective language (the magic words of 
Marduk, capable of generating a cosmos), in addition to the courage 
and strength to voluntarily confront and overcome chaos, the 
unknown. It could be argued that these are the defining features of 
the great central spirit of mankind, at least insofar as that spirit is 
noble and admirable. 

The ancient Egyptians formulated an idea similar in many 
important regards—which we will discuss later in detail—associating 
their savior-god Horus, son of Osiris, with the sharp-eyed falcon, 
and identifying him with the vision willing to search out, detect, 
understand, and defeat evil (symbolized with the famous Egyptian 
image of the single eye). Representing that reality—pay attention, 
above all, even to what is monstrous and malevolent, and speak 
wisely and truthfully—could be the single most important 
accomplishment of our species.* It allows us to apprehend in 
dramatic form the fundamental necessity of coming to grips with 
what our senses demonstrate to us, no matter how terrifying the 
reality revealed. It allows for the possibility of bringing our explicit 
understanding closer in line with our deepest being, making 
possible a truer union of body and spirit through the partial 


comprehension and imitation of the story. Most importantly, 
perhaps, it allows us to realize the immense importance of words in 
transforming potential into actuality, and helps us understand that 
the role we each play in that transformation is in some vital sense 
akin to the divine. 

After his election to the highest of places, Marduk challenges 
Tiamat directly, encloses her, defeated, in a giant net, and cuts her 
into pieces, fashioning the heavens and the earth from her remains. 
One of Marduk’s many names is, in fact, “he who makes ingenious 
things as a consequence of the conflict with Tiamat.”° It might be 
noted, in this regard, that tens of thousands of years ago, men 
literally did construct the habitable world out of the pieces of 
monsters, making their early dwellings from the giant bones of 
animals they had so courageously speared.° Marduk simultaneously 
defeats his grandmother’s monstrous army, including the leader, 
Kingu, from whom he takes the Tablet of Destinies, confirming his 
place as supreme leader of the cosmos. Then he returns home, 
enemies in tow. His compatriots celebrate his victory and accede yet 
more completely to his leadership, before he assigns them their 
various duties. Then, after consulting Ea, the god of wisdom, 
Marduk determines to create man, to aid the gods most 
fundamentally in the eternal task of maintaining the proper balance 
between order and chaos—to release those very gods from their 
service, and to transfer their burden onto our all-too-human 
shoulders.* 

The basic story is this: when order (Apsu) is carelessly threatened 
or destroyed, the terrible forces of chaos from which the world was 
originally derived appear once again in their most destructive, 
monstrous, predatory guise. Then a hero, representing the highest 
of values, must arise or be elected to confront this chaotic force. He 
does so successfully, deriving or producing something of great 
worth. What the hero represents is the most important of the great 
forces that make up the human psyche. To think of it another way: 
the hero is the embodied principle of action and perception that 
must rule over all the primordial psychological elements of lust, 
rage, hunger, thirst, terror, and joy. For chaos to remain effectively 


at bay (or, even better, tamed and therefore harnessed), this heroic 
principle must be regarded as the most important of all things that 
can organize and motivate mankind. This means, at least, that it 
must be continually acted out, which is what “regarded as 
important” actually means. It is in this way that the spirit of Marduk 
still possesses each individual who engages courageously in the 
processes of encounter and confrontation that eternally create and 
renew society. It is this that happens when each small child learns 
to regulate and unite his emotions and motivations into a coherent 
personality, and then goes out to challenge the unknown world. 

In slightly altered form, this is the story of St. George: The 
inhabitants of an ancient city must obtain water from a well beside 
the nest of a dragon. To do so, however, they have to offer the 
dragon some sacrifice—a sheep, under most circumstances, but a 
maiden, if no sheep can be found. The young women of the city 
draw lots when the supply of sheep is exhausted. One day it is the 
daughter of the king herself who loses. St. George appears, 
confronts the dragon with the sign of the cross—symbol of the 
eternal Redeemer, the archetypal hero—and frees the doomed 
princess. The city’s inhabitants then convert to Christianity. Victory 
over the dragon—the predator, as such, the ruler of unexplored 
territory—is victory over all the forces that have threatened the 
individual and society, over evolutionary and historical spans of 
time, as well as the more abstract evil we all still face, without and 
within. The cross, for its part, is the burden of life. It is a place of 
betrayal, torture, and death. It is therefore a fundamental symbol of 
mortal vulnerability. In the Christian drama, it is also the place 
where vulnerability is transcended, as a consequence of its 
acceptance. This voluntary acceptance is also equivalent to victory 
over the dragon, representation of chaos, death, and the unknown. 
By accepting life’s suffering, therefore, evil may be overcome. The 
alternative is hell, at least in its psychological form: rage, 
resentment, and the desire for revenge and destruction. 

The same story is echoed in the tales of St. Patrick, who chases 
the snakes out of Ireland, and St. Michael, who defeats the Christian 
equivalent of Kingu, “that ancient serpent called the devil” 


(Revelation 12:9). This is the same story recounted by J. R. R. 
Tolkien in The Hobbit, which was in turn derived from the ancient 
poem Beowulf, the tale of a hero defeating a pair of intelligent 
monsters—son, and then worse, mother.* In The Hobbit, the hero 
develops character and wisdom (as a thief, strangely enough) during 
his quest to help discover the ancient treasure hoarded by the 
dragon. The story of Perseus and Medusa, whose visage was so 
terrible that it turned onlookers to stone, is another variant, as is 
Pinocchio, who rescues his father from a subaquatic monster, and 
dies and is reborn while doing so. Something similar is portrayed in 
the first of the recent Avengers movies, in which Iron Man—the 
man who has transformed himself into a partly golden superhero— 
defeats the alien dragon worms of the Chitauri (allied with the 
satanic Loki). He then dies, is reborn, and gets the maiden (in the 
nonswooning guise of Ms. Pepper Potts). It must be understood: 
Such stories would not even be comprehensible (not least to 
children, as well as adults) if our evolutionary history had 
importantly differed, and if our entire culture had not been shaped, 
implicitly and explicitly, by these ancient patterns. 

All these heroes act out what was perhaps the greatest discovery 
ever made by man’s primordial ancestors: if you have the vision and 
the courage (and a good stout stick, when necessary), you can chase 
away the worst of snakes. No doubt the greatest of our ancestors 
were beginning to threaten snakes with sticks when we still lived in 
trees. No doubt it was those voluntarily snake-chasing ancestors 
who reaped the benefits of their bravery in the form of nearby 
grateful maidens (or their ancestral arboreal equivalents)—and 
perhaps this is why dragons hoard virgins, as well as gold. What 
constitutes the worst of all snakes and the stoutest of all sticks, 
however, might be regarded as the central religious questions of 
humanity. It is interesting to note that in The Hobbit, the worst 
snake is “only” a dragon, but in The Lord of the Rings, the worst 
snake, so to speak, is the much more abstract evil of the wizard 
Sauron. As humanity became more sophisticated in its capacity to 
abstract, we increasingly appreciated the fact that predatory 
monsters can come in many guises, only some of which are animal 


in their form. Literature of an arguably more sophisticated form 
endlessly echoes this realization. 


HERO, DRAGON, DEATH, AND REBIRTH: WHO YOU 
COULD BE (III) 


In the second volume of J. K. Rowling’s fantasy series, Harry Potter 
and the Chamber of Secrets, the castle of Hogwarts is threatened by 
strange, chaotic forces, due to the earlier and ongoing misbehavior 
of several powerful adult wizards (as established in volume one). 
Now, it is significant that Harry is orphaned: it is an integral part of 
the heroic pattern. He has his earthly parents, the thick and 
conventional Dursleys, willfully blind, shortsighted, and terribly 
overprotective of (and, therefore, tragically dangerous to) Dudley, 
their unfortunate but predictably self-centered and bullying natural 
son. But Harry has his heavenly parents, too, his true mother and 
father—symbolically, Nature and Culture (variants of chaos and 
order). They exist as part of his intrinsically magical potential—the 
magical potential of all of us, in fact, as we are all children of Nature 
and Culture, with the tremendous potential that implies, as well as 
the more mundane offspring of our particular parents.® 

When Harry returns to Hogwarts after his summer vacation, he 
can detect strange and ominous noises emanating from somewhere 
in the building. At the same time, various students and residents of 
Hogwarts are found paralyzed—turned to stone—in diverse 
locations around the building. Turned to stone: What could that 
possibly mean? It certainly means to be unable to move—but it also 
signifies something deeper. It means to be hunted; to become a 
rabbit confronted by a wolf; to become the horrified and awestruck 
object of the predatory gaze. Many herbivores, comparatively 
defenseless, facing imminent and brutal death, freeze in place, 
paralyzed by fear, depending on camouflage and immobility to 
render them invisible to the terrible intentions of nearby red- 
toothed and razor-clawed carnivores. Predatory, reptilian forms still 


particularly have that effect on human beings (hence our awed 
fascination, for example, with dinosaurs). But to have no more 
courage than a rabbit is definitely not to be everything you could be. 

Eventually Harry learns that the force turning his friends into 
stone is a gigantic snake, a basilisk, whose gaze exerts a paralyzing 
force. He discovers that this serpent is continually slithering around 
the very foundation of Hogwarts, in the immense waterworks that 
serve the great castle. This basilisk is an analog to the great dragon 
faced by Beowulf, hero of the thousand-year-old story that served as 
pattern for Tolkien’s adventures, perhaps the twentieth century’s 
closest cousins to J. K. Rowling’s extensive fantasy. It is, as well, the 
great devouring shark of the movie Jaws, lurking in the black water 
of night, ready at a moment’s notice to pull the naked and unwary 
below; the fragility of our homes and our institutions, which can 
collapse and leave us stripped of their protective walls in a single 
terrible moment; and more comprehensively, the underworld of the 
ancients, whose doors gape open when everything predictable 
collapses. At the deepest of levels, this is the chaos and potential 
that continually lurks under the order of our familiar worlds, 
psychological and social. 

After much searching, Harry gains entrance to this underworld 
labyrinth of pipes and tunnels, and finds the central chamber. He 
does this, significantly, through the sewer, acting out the ancient 
alchemical dictum, in sterquilinis invenitur: in filth it will be 
found.* What does this mean? That which you most need to find 
will be found where you least wish to look.* There, underground, 
Ginny (Virgin-ia), his best friend’s sister and Harry’s eventual 
serious romantic interest, lies unconscious. She is the maiden—or 
the anima, the soul—forever incarcerated by the dragon, as in the 
tale of St. George. It is up to Harry, orphaned hero, to wake and 
rescue her Gust as Tolkien’s Bilbo helps take the gold from the 
terrible Smaug; just as Disney’s Prince Phillip rescues Sleeping 
Beauty—both rescuing what is most valuable from the clutches of a 
great dragon).* 

And of course, the unknown is a great predator—the basilisk 
Harry faces—and of course, that predator guards a great treasure, 


gold beyond measure or the sleeping virgin, because the individual 
brave enough to voluntarily beard the serpent in his lair is most 
likely to gain access to the untold riches that exist in potential, 
awaiting us in the adventure of our life, away from security and 
what is currently known. Who dares wins*—if he does not perish. 
And who wins also makes himself irresistibly desirable and 
attractive, not least because of the development of character that 
adventure inevitably produces. And this is what makes us forever 
more than rabbits. 

And Harry, like Bilbo, can only manage this—can only perceive 
the serpent, when it is invisible to everyone else—because he has a 
dark side. Tolkien’s Bilbo must become a thief before he can 
become a hero. He must incorporate his monstrousness, so that he 
can supersede his naive harmlessness, before he is tough enough to 
face the terrors that confront him. Harry is touched by evil in 
another manner, as part of the incomparably dark wizard 
Voldemort’s soul is embedded within him (although neither he nor 
Voldemort are initially aware of this). It is for this reason that the 
young wizard can speak with and hear (that is, perceive) snakes. It 
is in keeping with this that he is disciplined and courageous, but 
also willing and ready to break the rules when necessary. 

While in the bowels of Hogwarts, Harry comes under attack by 
the basilisk, which is under the control of Voldemort. Voldemort 
therefore bears the same relationship to the basilisk in Hogwarts as 
Satan does, strangely and incomprehensibly, to the vision-granting 
serpent in the Genesis story of the Garden of Eden. Why might this 
be? It could be said—and should be—that one form of serpentine 
chaos and danger is the threat of the reptilian predator itself. But 
another form, more abstract—more psychological, more spiritual—is 
human evil: the danger we pose to one another. At some point in 
our evolutionary and cultural history, we began to understand that 
human evil could rightly be considered the greatest of all snakes. So, 
the symbolic progression might be (1) snake as evil predator, then 
(2) external human enemy as snake/evil/predator, then (3) 
subjective, personal, or psychological darkness/vengefulness/deceit 
as snake/evil/predator. Each of these representations, which took 


untold centuries, perhaps millennia to conceptualize, constitute a 
tangible increase in the sophistication of the image of evil.* 

All such manifestations of serpentine chaos and danger are 
apparently still first detected, processed, and symbolically 
interassociated by the ancient brain systems that evolved to protect 
us from predatory reptiles.*° And freezing—prompted by those 
systems—solves the problem now, maybe, by hiding the individual 
who is currently being preyed upon, but it leaves the predator alive 
for tomorrow. Instead, the danger must be hunted down and 
destroyed—and even that is too concrete to constitute a permanent 
solution to the problem of evil itself (rather than a solution to any 
particular exemplar of evil). Most profoundly and abstractly 
(paralleling the idea that the greatest predator, the greatest snake, is 
the evil that lurks within), evil’s destruction manifests as the life of 
virtue that constrains malevolence in its most abstracted and 
comprehensive form. It is for this reason, for example, that the 
Disney prince Phillip of Sleeping Beauty fame is armed for his 
conflict with the great Dragon of Chaos by benevolent Nature (in 
the form of the feminine fairies that accompany him and aid in his 
escape from Maleficent, the Evil Queen) with the Sword of Truth 
and Shield of Virtue. 

Harry directly confronts the basilisk, down in the Chamber of 
Secrets, deep below the wizarding castle, but is cornered and in 
great peril. At that propitious moment, a phoenix kept by the wise 
headmaster of Hogwarts arrives, provides the young hero with a 
sword, and then attacks the giant snake, providing Harry with time 
to regroup. Harry slays the basilisk with the weapon, but is fatally 
bitten in the process. This is another deep mythological echo: In the 
story of Genesis, for example, the encounter with the snake proves 
fatal to man and woman alike, who become aware of their fragility 
and inevitable death soon after they awaken and gain vision. It is 
also a harsh truth: predators devour, dragons lay waste, chaos 
destroys. The threat is real. Even truth, virtue, and courage are not 
necessarily enough, but they are our best bet. And sometimes a little 
death is the medication necessary to forestall death itself. 
Fortunately, the phoenix has magical, revivifying tears, which it 


cries into Harry’s wounds. Thus, the young wizard revives, defeats 
Voldemort (a much more challenging task than merely overcoming 
the gargantuan serpent), rescues Ginny, and saves the school. 

It is with the introduction of the phoenix to the story of St. 
George that Rowling reveals another element of her intuitive 
genius. The phoenix is a fowl that can die and be reborn forever. It 
has, therefore, throughout the ages, been a symbol of Christ, with 
whom the magical bird shares many features. It is also, equally, that 
element of the individual human personality that must die and 
regenerate, as it learns, painfully, through the oft-tragic experience 
that destroys previous certainty, replacing it first with doubt, and 
then—when successfully confronted—with new and more complete 
knowledge. A voluntary death-and-rebirth transformation—the 
change necessary to adapt when terrible things emerge—is therefore 
a solution to the potentially fatal rigidity of erroneous certainty, 
excessive order, and stultification. 


HOW TO ACT 


People exchange information about how to act in many ways. They 
observe each other and imitate what they see. When they imitate, 
they use their bodies to represent the bodies of others. But this 
imitation is not mindless, automatized mimicry. It is instead the 
ability to identify regularities or patterns in the behavior of other 
people, and then to imitate those patterns. When a young girl plays 
at being a mother, for example, she does not duplicate, gesture for 
gesture, what she has previously observed of her mother’s actions. 
Instead she acts “as if” she were a mother. If you ask the girl what 
she is doing, she will tell you that she is pretending to be a mother, 
but if you get her to describe what that means, particularly if she is 
a young child, her description will be far less complete than her 
actions would indicate. This means she can act out more than she 
can say—just as we all can. If you observed many little girls, acting 
out many mothers, you could derive a very good idea of what 
“mother” meant, in its purest form, even if you had never seen an 


actual mother. If you were good with words, then perhaps you could 
describe the essential elements of maternal behavior and transmit 
them. You might do that best in the form of a story. 

It is easier and more direct to represent a behavioral pattern with 
behavior than with words. Outright mimicry does that directly, 
action for action. Imitation, which can produce new behaviors akin 
to those that motivated the mimicry, takes that one step further. 
Drama—formalized imitation, enacted upon a stage—is precisely 
behavior portraying behavior, but distilled ever closer to the 
essence. Literature takes that transmission one more difficult step, 
portraying action in the imagination of the writer and the reader, in 
the complete absence of both real actors and a material stage. It is 
only the greatest of storytellers who can manage that 
transformation, representing the greatest and most vitally necessary 
of acts in the most interesting, profound, and memorable words. 
Generations of great storytellers, retelling, modifying, and editing 
great stories, therefore end up jointly creating the greatest of 
stories. Once cultures become literate (something that has 
happened only recently, from the historical perspective), those 
stories can be written down. It is at this point, roughly, that myth 
and ritual might be said to transform themselves into religion. 

The imitation and communication of the greatest, most 
memorable acts necessitates distillation and communication of the 
patterns of the deepest wisdom of mankind. If a great and 
memorable act is one undertaken by a particularly admirable 
individual, a local hero, then the greatest and most memorable acts 
possible would be those undertaken by the spirit (embodied in part 
by particular individuals) who exemplified what all local heroes 
everywhere have in common. That hero of heroes—that meta-hero— 
would have to exist, logically, in turn, in a place that was common 
across all places requiring heroism. That place might be regarded as 
a meta-world—even though it is real, even hyperreal (that is, more 
real in its abstraction across places than our direct perceptions of a 
given, singular time or place). It is precisely this hyperreal meta- 
world that consists of the continual interactions between chaos and 
order, which eternally serve as the battleground between good and 


evil characterizing the hero. The undying pattern that hero 
embodies, in turn—upon whose actions the individual and society 
both depend—is the highest of all Gods. He is both child of and 
mediator between those twin forces, transforming chaos into 
habitable order (as well as recasting order into chaos, so that it can 
be renewed, when it has become anachronistic and corrupt), as well 
as battling mightily so that good might prevail. 

Everyone requires a story to structure their perceptions and 
actions in what would otherwise be the overwhelming chaos of 
being. Every story requires a starting place that is not good enough 
and an ending place that is better. Nothing can be judged in the 
absence of that end place, that higher value. Without it, everything 
sinks into meaninglessness and boredom or degenerates and spirals 
into terror, anxiety, and pain. But, as time changes all things 
inexorably, every specific, value-predicated story may fail, in its 
particular incarnation and locale, and need replacement by 
something newer, more complete, but different. In consequence, 
the actor of a given story (and, therefore, someone deeply affiliated 
with the plot and the characterization) still must bow to the spirit of 
creative transformation that originally created and may need to 
destroy and re-create that story. It is for this reason that spirit 
eternally transcends dogma, truth transcends presupposition, 
Marduk transcends the elder gods, creativity updates society, and 
Christ transcends the law (as does Harry Potter, along with his 
courageous but continually rule-breaking friends). But it is 
important to remember, as we discussed in Rule I: Those who break 
the rules ethically are those who have mastered them first and 
disciplined themselves to understand the necessity of those rules, 
and break them in keeping with the spirit rather than the letter of 
the law. 

The second volume of Rowling’s series proposes that predatory 
evil can be overcome by the soul willing to die and be reborn. The 
complete series ends with a creatively transformed repetition of the 
same message. The analogy with Christianity is obvious, and the 
message, in essence, the same: The soul willing to transform, as 
deeply as necessary, is the most effective enemy of the demonic 


serpents of ideology and totalitarianism, in their personal and social 
forms. The healthy, dynamic, and above all else truthful personality 
will admit to error. It will voluntarily shed—let die—outdated 
perceptions, thoughts, and habits, as impediments to its further 
success and growth. This is the soul that will let its old beliefs burn 
away, often painfully, so that it can live again, and move forward, 
renewed. This is also the soul that will transmit what it has learned 
during that process of death and rebirth, so that others can be 
reborn along with it. 

Aim at something. Pick the best target you can currently 
conceptualize. Stumble toward it. Notice your errors and 
misconceptions along the way, face them, and correct them. Get 
your story straight. Past, present, future—they all matter. You need 
to map your path. You need to know where you were, so that you do 
not repeat the mistakes of the past. You need to know where you 
are, or you will not be able to draw a line from your starting point to 
your destination. You need to know where you are going, or you will 
drown in uncertainty, unpredictability, and chaos, and starve for 
hope and inspiration. For better or worse, you are on a journey. You 
are having an adventure—and your map better be accurate. 
Voluntarily confront what stands in your way. The way—that is the 
path of life, the meaningful path of life, the straight and narrow 
path that constitutes the very border between order and chaos, and 
the traversing of which brings them into balance. 

Aim at something profound and noble and lofty. If you can find a 
better path along the way, once you have started moving forward, 
then switch course. Be careful, though; it is not easy to discriminate 
between changing paths and simply giving up. (One hint: if the new 
path you see forward, after learning what you needed to learn along 
your current way, appears more challenging, then you can be 
reasonably sure that you are not deluding or betraying yourself 
when you change your mind.) In this manner, you will zigzag 
forward. It is not the most efficient way to travel, but there is no 
real alternative, given that your goals will inevitably change while 
you pursue them, as you learn what you need to learn while you are 
disciplining yourself. 


You will then find yourself turning across time, incrementally 
and gracefully, to aim ever more accurately at that tiny pinpoint, the 
X that marks the spot, the bull’s-eye, and the center of the cross; to 
aim at the highest value of which you can conceive. You will pursue 
a target that is both moving and receding: moving, because you do 
not have the wisdom to aim in the proper direction when you first 
take aim; receding, because no matter how close you come to 
perfecting what you are currently practicing, new vistas of possible 
perfection will open up in front of you. Discipline and 
transformation will nonetheless lead you inexorably forward. With 
will and luck, you will find a story that is meaningful and 
productive, improves itself with time, and perhaps even provides 
you with more than a few moments of satisfaction and joy. With 
will and luck, you will be the hero of that story, the disciplined 
sojourner, the creative transformer, and the benefactor of your 
family and broader society. 

Imagine who you could be, and then aim single-mindedly at that. 


RULE III 


DO NOT HIDE UNWANTED THINGS IN THE FOG 


THOSE DAMNED PLATES 


I love my father-in-law. I respect him, too. He is extremely stable 
emotionally—one of those tough or fortunate people (perhaps a 
little of both) who can let the trials and tribulations of life roll off 
him and keep moving forward with little complaint and plenty of 
competence. He is an old guy now, Dell Roberts—eighty-eight. He 
has had a knee replaced, and is planning to get the remaining one 
done. He has had stents inserted into his coronary arteries and a 
heart valve replaced. He suffers from drop foot and sometimes slips 
and falls because of it. But he was still curling a year ago, pushing 
the heavy granite rock down the ice with a stick specifically 
designed for people who can no longer crouch down as easily as 
they once could. 

When his wife, Beth, now deceased, developed dementia at a 
relatively young age, he took care of her in as uncomplaining and 
unresentful a manner as anyone could imagine. It was impressive. I 
am by no means convinced that I could have fared as well. He cared 
for her right to the point where it became impossible for him to lift 
her out of whatever chair she had settled into. This was long after 
she had lost the ability to speak. But it was obvious by the way her 
eyes lit up when he entered the room that she still loved him—and 
the feeling was mutual. I would not describe him as someone who is 
prone to avoidance when the going gets tough. Quite the contrary. 


When Dell was a much younger man, he was for several decades 
a real estate dealer in Fairview, Alberta—the small town where I 
grew up (we lived right across the street from the Roberts family, in 
fact). During that time, he habitually went home for lunch, in 
accordance with the general custom. Beth typically prepared him 
soup (probably Campbell’s, which everyone ate at that time—“M’m! 
M’m! Good!”), and a sandwich. One day, without warning, he 
snapped at his wife: “Why in the world do we always eat off these 
tiny plates? I hate eating off these tiny plates!” 

She had been serving the sandwiches on bread-and-butter plates, 
which average about six or seven inches in diameter, instead of full- 
size dinner plates of ten to twelve inches. She related this story to 
her daughters, soon after, in a state of mild shock. This story has 
been retold to much laughter at family gatherings many times since. 
After all, she had been serving him lunch on those plates for at least 
twenty years by the time he finally said anything. She had no idea 
that he was annoyed by her table settings. He had never objected. 
And there is something inexhaustibly amusing about that. 

Now, it is possible that he was irritated by something else 
altogether that day and did not really care about the plates. And in 
one sense, it is a trivial issue. But seen another way, it is not trivial 
at all, for two reasons. First, if something happens every day, it is 
important, and lunch was happening every day. In consequence, if 
there was something about it that was chronically bothersome, even 
in a minor sort of way, it needed to be attended to. Second, it is very 
common to allow so-called minor irritations (which are not minor, 
as I said, if they happen constantly) to continue for years without 
comment or resolution. 

Here is the problem: Collect a hundred, or a thousand, of those, 
and your life is miserable and your marriage doomed. Do not 
pretend you are happy with something if you are not, and if a 
reasonable solution might, in principle, be negotiated. Have the 
damn fight. Unpleasant as that might be in the moment, it is one 
less straw on the camel’s back. And that is particularly true for those 
daily events that everyone is prone to regard as trivial—even the 


plates on which you eat your lunch. Life is what repeats, and it is 
worth getting what repeats right. 


JUST NOT WORTH THE FIGHT 


Here is a more serious story of the same type. I had a client who had 
come to see me about her plans to move to private practice after 
many years as an accountant with a large corporation. She was well 
respected in her profession, and was a competent, kind, and careful 
person. But she was also very unhappy. I presumed initially that her 
unhappiness stemmed from anxiety about her career transition. But 
she managed that move without a hitch during the time we 
continued our sessions, while other issues rose to the forefront. 

Her problem was not her career change. It was her marriage. She 
described her husband as extraordinarily self-centered and 
simultaneously overly concerned with how he appeared in the eyes 
of others. It was a contradictory combination, in some manner, 
although it is common enough to see this touching of opposites in a 
personality: If you lean too far in one direction, something else in 
you leans equally far in the other. So, despite the husband’s 
narcissism (at least from his wife’s perspective), he was in thrall to 
the opinions of everyone he met—excepting the members of his 
own family. He also drank too much—a habit which exaggerated his 
temperamental defects. 

My client was not comfortable in her own home. She did not feel 
there was anything truly of her within the apartment she shared 
with her husband (the couple had no children). Her situation 
provided a good example of how what is outside can profoundly 
reflect what is inside (which is why I suggest to people who are in 
psychological trouble that they might begin their recovery by 
cleaning up—and then beautifying, if possible—their rooms). All 
their household furnishings, which she described as showy, ornate, 
and uncomfortable, had been chosen by her husband. Furthermore, 
he avidly collected 1960s and 70s pop art, and the walls of the house 
were crowded with these items, which he had spent time seeking 


out in galleries and otherwise gathering for many years, often while 
she sat waiting outside in the car. 

She told me that she did not care about the furnishings and the 
excess of decorative objects, but that was not really true. What was 
true was that she did not care for them—not a bit. Neither the 
showiness nor the furnishings nor the plethora of art works that 
made up her husband’s collection appealed to her taste. She tended 
toward a minimalist aesthetic (or perhaps that preference was a 
consequence of her husband’s decorative excesses). It was never 
quite clear what she might have preferred, and perhaps that was 
part of the problem: because she did not know what she liked (and 
was equally vague about her dislikes), she was not in the strongest 
position to put forward her own opinions. It is difficult to win an 
argument, or even begin one, if you have not carefully articulated 
what you want (or do not) and need (or do not). 

However, she certainly did not enjoy feeling like a stranger in her 
own home. For that reason, she never had friends over to visit, 
which was also a nontrivial problem, contributing as it did to her 
feelings of isolation. But the furnishings and paintings continued to 
accrue, one shopping expedition at a time, in Canada and abroad, 
and with each purchase there was less of her in the house and in the 
marriage, and increasingly more of her husband. Nonetheless, my 
client never went to war. She never had a fit of anger. She never put 
her fist through a particularly objectionable canvas hanging on the 
living room wall. In all the decades of her married life, she never 
had an outburst of genuine rage; she never directly and conclusively 
confronted the fact that she hated her home and her subordination 
to her husband’s taste. Instead, she let him have his way, 
repeatedly, increment by increment, because she claimed that such 
trivialities were not worth fighting for. And with each defeat, the 
next disagreement became more necessary—although less likely, 
because she understood that a serious discussion, once initiated, 
risked expanding to include all the things that were troublesome 
about her marriage, and that a real, no-holds-barred battle would 
therefore likely ensue. Then everything wrong might spill out and 
have to be faced and dealt with, by one means or another. So, she 


kept silent. But she was chronically repressed and constantly 
resentful, and felt that she had wasted much of the opportunity of 
her life. 

It is a mistake to consider the furnishings and the pop art 
paintings as simple material objects. They were more truly and 
importantly containers of information, so to speak, about the state 
of the marriage, and were certainly experienced as such by my 
client. Every single object of art was the concrete realization of a 
victory (Pyrrhic though it may have been) and a defeat (or, at least, 
a negotiation that did not occur and, therefore, a fight that was over 
before it started). And there were dozens or perhaps hundreds of 
these: each a weapon in an unspoken, destructive, and decades-long 
war. Unsurprisingly, given the circumstances, the couple split up— 
after thirty years of marriage. I believe the husband retained all the 
furniture and art. 

Here is a thought, a terrifying and dispiriting thought, to motivate 
improvement in your marriage—to scare you into the appalling 
difficulties of true negotiation. Every little problem you have every 
morning, afternoon, or evening with your spouse will be repeated 
for each of the fifteen thousand days that will make up a forty-year 
marriage. Every trivial but chronic disagreement about cooking, 
dishes, housecleaning, responsibility for finances, or frequency of 
intimate contact will be duplicated, over and over, unless you 
successfully address it. Perhaps you think (moment to moment, at 
least) that it is best to avoid confrontation and drift along in 
apparent but false peace. Make no mistake about it, however: you 
age as you drift, just as rapidly as you age as you strive. But you 
have no direction when you drift, and the probability that you will 
obtain what you need and want by drifting aimlessly is very low. 
Things fall apart of their own accord, but the sins of men speed their 
deterioration: that is wisdom from the ages. It may well be that 
conscious apprehension of the horror of the same small hell forever 
repeated is precisely what is necessary to force you to confront the 
problems in your marriage and negotiate in good and desperate 
faith to solve them. However, it is the easiest of matters, 
particularly in the short term, to ignore the prick of conscience and 


let the small defeats slide, day after day. This is not a good strategy. 
Only careful aim and wakeful striving and commitment can 
eliminate the oft-incremental calamity of willful blindness, stem the 
entropic tide, and keep catastrophe—familial and social alike—at 
bay. 


CORRUPTION: COMMISSION AND OMISSION 


Corruption of the form we are discussing is, in my opinion, 
integrally linked to deception—to lying, more bluntly—and more 
important, to self-deception. Now, strict logicians regard self- 
deception as an impossibility. They cannot understand how it is 
possible for a person to believe one thing and its opposite 
simultaneously. Logicians are not psychologists, however—and they 
obviously do not notice, or else fail to take into account, the fact 
that they themselves have family members, for example, for whom 
they at least occasionally feel love and hate at the same time. 
Furthermore, it is not obvious what “believe” means when 
discussing human belief, nor what is meant by “simultaneously.” I 
can believe one thing today and another tomorrow and very often 
get away with it, at least in the short term. And on many occasions I 
have experienced what was very nearly simultaneous belief in one 
thing and its opposite while reading undergraduate university 
papers, in which the writer made a claim in one paragraph and a 
completely contradictory claim in the next. (Sometimes that 
happened within the span of a single sentence.) 

There are many conditions or circumstances under which self- 
deception can theoretically occur. Psychoanalysts have explored 
many of these, with Freud leading the way. Freud believed that 
much of mental illness was due to repression, which is arguably and 
reasonably considered a form of self-deception. For him, memories 
of traumatically troubling events were unconsciously banished to 
perdition in the unconscious, where they rattled around and caused 
trouble, like poltergeists in a dungeon. Freud understood that the 
human personality was not unitary. Instead, it consists of a loose, 


fragmented cacophony of spirits, who do not always agree or even 
communicate. The truth of this claim is self-evident, at least in one 
simple manner: we can think about things—we can simulate 
potential or alternative actions or events—without immediately 
having to act them out. Dissociation of thought and action is 
necessary for abstract thought even to exist. Thus, we can clearly 
think or say one thing and do another. This is fine when merely 
thinking, prior to acting, but perhaps not so good when we promise 
or claim to believe something and then act in a manner indicating 
that we truly have faith in something else. This is a form of 
deception, a disjunction in character, a contradiction between 
modes of being. It has even been named: to claim one belief and 
then to act (or speak) in a different or even opposite manner 
constitutes a performative contradiction, according to certain 
modern philosophers:* an implicit lie, in my opinion. The holding of 
contradictory beliefs also becomes a problem when the holder 
attempts to act out both simultaneously and discovers, often to his 
or her great chagrin, the paradox that makes such an attempt 
impossible. 

Freud catalogued an extensive list of phenomena akin to 
repression—the active rejection of potentially conscious 
psychological material from awareness—which he termed “defense 
mechanisms.” These include denial (“the truth is not so bad”), 
reaction formation (“I really, really, really love my mother”), 
displacement (“the boss yells at me, I yell at my wife, my wife yells 
at the baby, the baby bites the cat”), identification (“I am bullied, so 
I am motivated to be a bully”), rationalization (a self-serving 
explanation for a low-quality action), intellectualization (a favorite 
of the early, funny, neurotic Woody Allen), sublimation (“I can 
always paint nude women”), and projection (“I am not touchy; you 
are just annoying”). Freud was an outstanding philosopher of deceit. 
He was not afraid to point out the relationship between dishonesty 
and psychopathology. Nonetheless, his ideas of self-deception 
suffer, in my opinion, from two major errors. 

First error: Freud failed to notice that sins of omission 
contributed to mental illness as much as, or more than, the sins of 


commission, listed above, that constitute repression. In doing so, he 
merely thought in the typical manner. People generally believe that 
actively doing something bad (that is the sin of commission) is, on 
average, worse than passively not doing something good (that is the 
sin of omission). Perhaps this is because there are always good 
things we are not doing; some sins of omission are therefore 
inevitable. In any case, there are still times when willful blindness 
nonetheless produces more serious catastrophes, more easily 
rationalized away, than the active or the unconscious repression of 
something terrible but understood (the latter being a sin of 
commission, because it is known). The former problem—willful 
blindness—occurs when you could come to know something but 
cease exploring so that you fail to discover something that might 
cause you substantial discomfort. Spin doctors call this self-imposed 
ignorance “plausible deniability,” which is a phrase that indicates 
intellectualized rationalization of the most pathological order. It 
should be noted that such blindness is often regarded as an outright 
crime. If you are a CEO, for example, and you suspect that your 
treasurer is cooking the books, and you do not investigate because 
you do not want to know, you may still be liable for your inaction— 
as is appropriate. Failing to look under the bed when you strongly 
suspect a monster is lurking there is not an advisable strategy. 

Second error: Freud assumed that things experienced are things 
understood. In accordance with that assumption, he believed that a 
memory trace existed, somewhere in the mind, that accurately 
represented the past, like an objective video recording. These would 
be reasonable presumptions, if our experience was simply a series 
of objectively real and self-evident events transmitted through our 
senses, thought about, evaluated, and then acted upon. If this was 
all true, traumatic experience would be accurately represented in 
memory, even when pushed out of awareness by unconscious 
mechanisms (or conscious—but Freud presumed the former) 
because of its understood but terrible nature. However, neither 
reality nor our processing of reality is as objective or articulated as 
Freud presupposed. 


Imagine, for example, that you have been ignored, romantically— 
more than you can tolerate—for several months by your wife or 
husband. Then you encounter him or her leaning over the fence, 
talking in a friendly manner (and perhaps no more than that) to an 
attractive neighbor. How we process such anomalous, novel, 
troublesome, or even traumatic experience is very rarely a matter of 
perception, followed by conscious understanding and thought, then 
emotion or motivation derived from that thought, then action. What 
happens instead is akin to what we discussed at length in Rule I and 
Rule II: We process the unknown world from the bottom up. We 
encounter containers of information, so to speak, whose full import 
is by no means self-evident. Upon witnessing your spouse talking to 
the neighbor, therefore, it is not as if you think, in an altogether 
articulated and fully developed philosophical form: “I have been 
lonesome and deprived physically for months by my spouse. 
Although I have not said anything in detail, this has caused me 
constant frustration and pain. Now he (or she) is rubbing it in, as far 
as I am concerned, by being so outgoing with a comparative stranger 
when I have experienced so little attention.” It is much more likely 
that anger, grief, and loneliness have accumulated within you with 
each rejection, bit by bit, until you are filled to the brim—and, now, 
overflowing. 

That sudden appearance of negative emotion does not necessarily 
mean that you are even now fully conscious of its accumulation. 
You may well (as in the case of my father-in-law, or my client) have 
experienced the frustration build up gradually enough so that you 
found yourself more irritable and unhappy, but that does not 
necessarily mean that you noticed the cause. And what is the cause? 
The range of possibilities is uncomfortably broad. Perhaps you are 
not being ignored at all. Instead, you have been having trouble at 
work, and that has produced a decrease in your overall confidence. 
In consequence, you have become sensitized to any signs of 
rejection, even imaginary, within your marriage. So, what you must 
determine is not so much why your wife or husband is no longer 
attentive to you, but what it is about your boss, colleagues, or career 
that is destabilizing you. That puts the true cause of your discomfort 


a long distance away from the symptoms (the feelings of rejection) 
that are making you irritable, sensitive, and hurt. There is nothing 
obvious about the relationship between cause and effect in such 
cases. Perhaps you really are being ignored, just as you suspect. 
Perhaps it is a sign of an impending affair and a manifestation of 
the trajectory that leads to divorce. Both of those, if true, are serious 
problems. It is no wonder you are upset. But you may remain 
stubbornly unwilling to consider that your career or marriage is in 
trouble. And that is no surprise. But it is not helpful. 

On top of all that is the general complexity of life, complicating 
the search for clarity. Consider the question “What really 
happened?” say, in a failed marriage, divorce, and child-custody 
battle. The answer to that query is so complex that settling the 
disagreements frequently requires court evaluation and multi-party 
assessment. Even then, one or even both of the protagonists is 
unlikely to believe that the truth has been served. This is partly 
because events in general and interpersonal events specifically do 
not exist as simple, objective facts, independent of one another. 
Everything depends for its meaning—for the information it truly 
represents—on the context in which it is embedded, much of which 
is not available for perception or consideration when the event in 
question occurs. The meaning of what someone’s wife says to him 
today is dependent on everything both have ever said to each other, 
everything they have ever done together, and the contents of their 
mutual imaginations—and that does not exhaust the complexity. 
Such meaning may even be importantly dependent on how, for 
example, the wife’s mother treated her father (or her grandmother 
treated her grandfather), as well as the relationship between men 
and women in the broader culture. That is why domestic arguments 
so often spiral out of control, particularly when a pattern of 
continual and effective communication has never been established. 
One thing leads to a deeper thing, and that leads deeper yet, until an 
argument that started over what size plates are best used at 
lunchtime turns into a no-holds-barred war about whether the 
marriage in question would be better dissolved. And there is 
certainly fear of falling down a hole of that size (again, particularly 


when much has remained unspoken) that motivates the proclivity 
to keep things to yourself when they would be better, but 
dangerously, said. 


WHAT IS THE FOG? 


Imagine that you are afraid. You have reason to be. You are afraid of 
yourself. You are afraid of other people. You are afraid of the world. 
You are nostalgic for the innocence of the past; for the time before 
you learned the terrible things that shattered the trust 
characterizing your childhood. The knowledge you have gained of 
yourself, other people, and the world has embittered more than 
enlightened. You have been betrayed, hurt, and disappointed. You 
have become distrustful even of hope itself, as your hope has been 
repeatedly shattered (and that is the very definition of 
hopelessness). The last thing you want is to know more. Better to 
leave what is enshrouded in mystery. Better, as well, to avoid 
thinking too much (or at all) about what could be. When ignorance 
is bliss, after all, ’tis folly to be wise. 

Imagine, more precisely, that you are so afraid that you will not 
allow yourself even to know what you want. Knowing would 
simultaneously mean hoping, and your hopes have been dashed. 
You have your reasons for maintaining your ignorance. You are 
afraid, perhaps, that there is nothing worth wanting; you are afraid 
that if you specify what you want precisely you will simultaneously 
discover (and all too clearly) what constitutes failure; you are afraid 
that failure is the most likely outcome; and, finally, you are afraid 
that if you define failure and then fail, you will know beyond a 
shadow of a doubt that it was you that failed, and that it was your 
fault. 

So, you do not allow yourself to know what you want. You 
manage this by refusing to think it through. You are happy, 
satisfied, and engaged sometimes and unhappy, frustrated, and 
nihilistic other times, but you will not enquire deeply into why, 
because then you would know, and then you would encounter yet- 


again shattered hope and confirmed disappointment. You are also 
afraid, but for different reasons, to allow others to know what you 
want. First, if they were to find out just what you wanted, then they 
might tell you, and then you would know, even if you were fighting 
against gathering that very knowledge. Second, if they knew, they 
could then deny you what you truly wanted, even needed, and hurt 
you much more efficiently than they might if your deepest desires 
(and, therefore, your vulnerabilities) remained secret. 

The fog that hides is the refusal to notice—to attend to—emotions 
and motivational states as they arise, and the refusal to 
communicate them both to yourself and to the people who are close 
to you. A bad mood signifies something. A state of anxiety or 
sadness signifies something, and not likely something that will 
please you to discover. The most probable outcome of successfully 
articulating an emotion that has accrued without expression over 
time is tears—an admission of vulnerability and pain (which are 
also feelings that people do not like to allow, particularly when they 
are feeling distrustful and angry). Who wants to dig down into the 
depths of pain and grief and guilt until the tears emerge? And 
voluntary refusal to take notice of our emotional states is not the 
only impediment to dealing with them. If your wife or husband (or 
whomever else you are tangled up with, unhappily, at the moment) 
says something that comes too close to the painful truth, for 
example, then a sharp and insulting remark will often shut them up 
—and is therefore very likely to be offered. This is partly a test: does 
the person being insulted care enough about you and your suffering 
to dig past a few obstacles and unearth the bitter truth? It is also 
partly, and more obviously, defensive: if you can chase someone 
away from something you yourself do not want to discover, that 
makes your life easier in the present. Sadly, it is also very 
disappointing if that defense succeeds, and is typically accompanied 
by a sense of abandonment, loneliness, and self-betrayal. You must 
nonetheless still live among other people, and they with you. And 
you have desires, wants, and needs, however unstated and unclear. 
And you are still motivated to pursue them, not least because it is 


impossible to live without desire, want, and need.sf'Your strategy, 
under such conditions? Show your disappointment whenever 
someone close to you makes you unhappy; allow yourself the luxury 
and pleasure of resentment when something does not go your way; 
ensure that the person who has transgressed against you is frozen 
out by your disapproval; force them to discover with as much 
difficulty as possible exactly what they have done to disappoint you; 
and, finally, let them grope around blindly in the fog that you have 
generated around yourself until they stumble into and injure 
themselves on the sharp hidden edges of your unrevealed 
preferences and dreams. And maybe these responses are tests, too— 
tests deeply associated with the lack of courage to trust: “If you 
really loved me, you would brave the terrible landscape that I have 
arrayed around myself to discover the real me.” And perhaps there 
is even something to such claims, implicit though they may be. A 
certain testing of commitment might have its utility. Everything 
does not have to be given away for free. But even a little 
unnecessary mystery goes a long way. 

And you still must live with yourself. In the short term, perhaps 
you are protected from the revelation of your insufficiency by your 
refusal to make yourself clear. Every ideal is a judge, after all: the 
judge who says, “You are not manifesting your true potential.” No 
ideals? No judge. But the price paid for that is purposelessness. This 
is a high price. No purpose? Then, no positive emotion, as most of 
what drives us forward with hope intact is the experience of 
approaching something we deeply need and want. And worse, when 
we are without purpose: chronic, overwhelming anxiety, as focused 
purpose constrains what is otherwise likely to be the intolerable 
chaos of unexploited possibility and too much choice. 

If you make what you want clear and commit yourself to its 
pursuit, you may fail. But if you do not make what you want clear, 
then you will certainly fail. You cannot hit a target that you refuse to 
see. You cannot hit a target if you do not take aim. And, equally 
dangerously, in both cases: you will not accrue the advantage of 
aiming, but missing. You will not benefit from the learning that 


inevitably takes place when things do not go your way. Success at a 
given endeavor often means trying, falling short, recalibrating (with 
the new knowledge generated painfully by the failure), and then 
trying again and falling short—often repeated, ad nauseam. 
Sometimes all that learning, impossible without the failure, leads 
you to see that aiming your ambition in a different direction would 
be better (not because it is easier; not because you have given up; 
not because you are avoiding—but because you have learned 
through the vicissitudes of your experience that what you seek is 
not to be found where you were looking, or is simply not attainable 
in the manner by which you chose to pursue it). 

So, what might you do—what should you do—as an alternative to 
hiding things in the fog? Admit to your feelings. This is a very tricky 
matter (and it does not simply mean “give in” to them). First, 
noting, much less communicating, feelings of (petty) anger or pain 
due to lonesomeness, or anxiety about something that might be 
trivial, or jealousy that is likely unwarranted is embarrassing. The 
admission of such feelings is a revelation of ignorance, 
insufficiency, and vulnerability. Second, it is unsettling to allow for 
the possibility that your feelings, however overwhelming and 
convincing, might be misplaced and, in your ignorance, pointing you 
in the wrong direction. It is possible that you have misinterpreted 
the situation entirely, for reasons of which you remain 
fundamentally unconscious. It is for such reasons that trust is vital: 
but trust of the mature and tragic sort. A naive person trusts 
because he or she believes that people are essentially or even 
universally trustworthy. But any person who has truly lived has 
been—or has—betrayed. 

Someone with experience knows that people are capable of 
deception and willing to deceive. That knowledge brings with it an 
arguably justified pessimism about human nature, personal and 
otherwise, but it also opens the door to another kind of faith in 
humanity: one based on courage, rather than naivete. I will trust 
you—I will extend my hand to you—despite the risk of betrayal, 
because it is possible, through trust, to bring out the best in you, 
and perhaps in me. So, I will accept substantial risk to open the door 


to cooperation and negotiation. And even if you do betray me, in a 
not-too unforgivable manner (assuming a certain degree, shall we 
say, of genuine apology and contrition on your part), I will continue 
to extend my hand. And part of the way I will do that is by telling 
you what I am feeling. 

A certain necessary humility must accompany such raw 
revelations. I should not say—at least not ideally—“You have been 
ignoring me lately.” I should say, instead, “I feel isolated and lonely 
and hurt, and cannot help but feel that you have not been as 
attentive to me over the last few months as I would have liked or 
that might have been best for us as a couple. But I am unsure if I 
am just imagining all this because I am upset or if I am genuinely 
seeing what is going on.” The latter statement gets the point across, 
but avoids the accusatory stance that so often serves as the first 
defense against a serious, get-to-the-bottom-of-things conversation. 
And it is very possible that you are wrong about just what is causing 
you to feel the way you do. If you are, you need to know it, because 
there is no point in propagating errors that are causing you and 
others pain and interfering with your future. Best to find out what is 
true—best to disperse the fog—and find out if the sharp objects you 
feared were lurking there are real or fantastical. And there is always 
the danger that some of them are real. But it is better to see them 
than to keep them occluded by the fog, because you can at least 
sometimes avoid the danger that you are willing to see. 


EVENTS AND MEMORIES 


Events, as they lay themselves out in front of us, do not simply 
inform us of why they occur, and we do not remember the past in 
order to objectively record bounded, well-defined events and 
situations. The latter act is impossible, in any case. The information 
in our experience is latent, like gold in ore—the case we made in 
Rule II. It must be extracted and refined with great effort, and often 
in collaboration with other people, before it can be employed to 
improve the present and the future. We use our past effectively 


when it helps us repeat desirable—and avoid repeating undesirable 
—experiences. We want to know what happened but, more 
importantly, we want to know why. Why is wisdom. Why enables 
us to avoid making the same mistake again and again, and if we are 
fortunate helps us repeat our successes. 

Extracting useful information from experience is difficult. It 
requires the purest of motivations (“things should be made better, 
not worse”) to perform it properly. It requires the willingness to 
confront error, forthrightly, and to determine at what point and why 
departure from the proper path occurred. It requires the willingness 
to change, which is almost always indistinguishable from the 
decision to leave something (or someone, or some idea) behind. 
Therefore, the simplest response imaginable is to look away and 
refuse to think, while simultaneously erecting unsurmountable 
impediments to genuine communication. 

Unfortunately, in the longer term, this willful blindness leaves 
life murky and foggy; leaves it void, unseen, without form, confused 
—and leaves you bewildered and astonished.* This is all a strange 
concatenation of the psychological and the real, the subjective and 
the objective. Is something frightening, or am I afraid? Is something 
beautiful, or am I imposing the idea of beauty upon it? When I 
become angry with someone, is it because of something they have 
done, or my lack of control? Such questions define the state of 
confusion you occupy chronically when the bottom has fallen out of 
your world. That state can have an objective element, because a fall 
is often caused by something real, such as a death, a serious illness, 
or a bout of unemployment; but it is also subjective, associated with 
a state composed of pain, doubt, confusion, and the inability to 
choose—or even perceive—a path forward. 

The ground of Being is subject and object simultaneously— 
motivation, emotion, and material thing all at once—before 
perception is clarified, before the world is articulated. The wife 
remains uncomprehended. The context of her speech remains 
unexplored, for fear of what that exploration might reveal. The 
situation cannot be described because the word is left vague and 
unformed. Our own personal motivations begin in hidden form, and 


remain that way, because we do not want to know what we are up 
to. The wheat remains unseparated from the chaff. The gold 
remains in the clutches of the dragon, as does the virgin. The 
philosopher’s stone remains undiscovered in the gutter; and the 
information hidden in the round chaos, beckoning, remains 
unexplored. Such omission is the voluntary refusal of expanded 
consciousness. After all, the pathway to the Holy Grail has its 
beginnings in the darkest part of the forest, and what you need 
remains hidden where you least want to look. 

If you pile up enough junk in your closet, one day, when you are 
least prepared, the door will spring open, and all of what has been 
packed inside, growing inexorably in the darkness, will bury you, 
and you may not have enough time or energy left in your life to 
confront it, sort through it, keep what you need, and discard the 
rest. This is what it means to be crushed under excess baggage. This 
is the return of Tiamat, the great Mesopotamian Goddess of Chaos, 
destroyer of those who act improperly. 

The world is full of hidden dangers and obstacles—and 
opportunities. Leaving everything hidden in the fog because you are 
afraid of the danger you may find there will be of little help when 
fate forces you to run headlong toward what you have refused to 
see. Impaling yourself on sharp branches, stumbling over boulders, 
and rushing by places of sanctuary, you will finally refuse to admit 
you could have burned away the haze with the bright light of your 
consciousness, had you not hidden it under a bushel. Then you will 
come to curse man, reality, and God himself for producing such an 
impenetrable maze of impediments and barriers. Corruption will 
beckon to you, led as you increasingly will be by dark, unexamined 
motivations—bred by failure, amplified by frustration—viciously 
culminating in the resentful belief that those who have transgressed 
against you are getting from you exactly what they deserve. This 
attitude and the actions and inactions it will inevitably produce will 
impoverish your life, your community, your nation, and the world. 
This will in turn impoverish Being itself (and that will be exactly 
what your darkest unexamined motivations desire). 


With careful searching, with careful attention, you might tip the 
balance toward opportunity and against obstacle sufficiently so that 
life is clearly worth living, despite its fragility and suffering. If you 
truly wanted, perhaps you would receive, if you asked. If you truly 
sought, perhaps you would find what you seek. If you knocked, truly 
wanting to enter, perhaps the door would open. But there will be 
times in your life when it will take everything you have to face what 
is in front of you, instead of hiding away from a truth so terrible 
that the only thing worse is the falsehood you long to replace it 
with. 

Do not hide unwanted things in the fog. 


RULE IV 


NOTICE THAT OPPORTUNITY LURKS WHERE 
RESPONSIBILITY HAS BEEN ABDICATED 


MAKE YOURSELF INVALUABLE 


In my dual role as clinical psychologist and professor, I have 
coached many people in the development of their careers. 
Sometimes those I am coaching consult me because their 
coworkers, subordinates, or bosses will not do their jobs properly. 
They are supervised by, working alongside, or managing people who 
are narcissistic, incompetent, malevolent, or tyrannical. Such things 
happen and must be dealt with in whatever reasonable manner will 
bring them to a halt. I do not encourage people to martyr 
themselves. It is a bad idea to sacrifice yourself uncomplainingly so 
that someone else can take the credit. Nonetheless, under such 
circumstances—if you are a wise and attentive person—you might 
still notice that your unproductive coworkers are leaving a plethora 
of valuable tasks undone. You might then ask yourself, “What 
would happen if I took responsibility for doing them?” It is a 
daunting question. What is left undone is often risky, difficult, and 
necessary. But that also means—does it not?—that it is worthwhile 
and significant. And you may have the eyes to see that there is a 
problem, despite your all-too-frequent blindness. How do you know 
that it is not, therefore, your problem? Why do you notice this issue 
and not some other? This is a question worth considering in depth. 
If you want to become invaluable in a workplace—in any 
community—just do the useful things no one else is doing. Arrive 


earlier and leave later than your compatriots (but do not deny 
yourself your life). Organize what you can see is dangerously 
disorganized. Work, when you are working, instead of looking like 
you are working. And finally, learn more about the business—or 
your competitors—than you already know. Doing so will make you 
invaluable—a veritable lynchpin. People will notice that and begin to 
appreciate your hard-earned merits. 

You might object, “Well, I just could not manage to take on 
something that important.” What if you began to build yourself into 
a person who could? You could start by trying to solve a small 
problem—something that is bothering you, that you think you could 
fix. You could start by confronting a dragon of just the size that you 
are likely to defeat. A tiny serpent might not have had the time to 
hoard a lot of gold, but there might still be some treasure to be won, 
along with a reasonable probability of succeeding in such a quest 
(and not too much chance of a fiery or toothsome death). Under 
reasonable circumstances, picking up the excess responsibility is an 
opportunity to become truly invaluable. And then, if you want to 
negotiate for a raise, or more autonomy—or more free time, for that 
matter—you can go to your boss and say, “Here are ten things that 
were crying out to be done, each of them vital, and I am now doing 
all of them. If you help me out a bit, I will continue. I might even 
improve. And everything, including your life, will improve along 
with me.” And then, if your boss has any sense—and sometimes 
bosses do—then your negotiation will be successful. That is how 
such things work. And do not forget that there is no shortage of 
genuinely good people who are thrilled if they can give someone 
useful and trustworthy a hand up. It is one of the truly altruistic 
pleasures of life, and its depth is not to be underestimated, or to be 
disregarded with the cheap cynicism that masks itself as world- 
weary wisdom. 

It appears that the meaning that most effectively sustains life is 
to be found in the adoption of responsibility. When people look 
back on what they have accomplished, they think, if they are 
fortunate: “Well, I did that, and it was valuable. It was not easy. But 
it was worth it.” It is a strange and paradoxical fact that there is a 


reciprocal relationship between the worth of something and the 
difficulty of accomplishing it. Imagine the following conversation: 
“Do you want difficulty?” “No, I want ease.” “In your experience, has 
doing something easy been worthwhile?” “Well, no, not very often.” 
“Then perhaps you really want something difficult.” I think that is 
the secret to the reason for Being itself: difficult is necessary. 

It is for this reason that we voluntarily and happily place 
limitations on ourselves. Every time we play a game, for example, 
we accept a set of arbitrary restrictions. We narrow and limit 
ourselves, and explore the possibilities thereby revealed. That is 
what makes the game. But it does not work without the arbitrary 
rules. You take them on voluntarily, absurdly, as in chess: “I can 
only move this knight in an L. How ridiculous. But how fun!” 
Because it is not fun, oddly enough, if you can move any piece 
anywhere. It is not a game anymore if you can make any old move 
at all. Accept some limitations, however, and the game begins. 
Accept them, more broadly speaking, as a necessary part of Being 
and a desirable part of life. Assume you can transcend them by 
accepting them. And then you can play the limited game properly. 

And this is all not merely of psychological import, and it is by no 
means just a game. People need meaning, but problems also need 
solving. It is very salutary, from the psychological perspective, to 
find something of significance—something worth sacrificing for (or 
to), something worth confronting and taking on. But the suffering 
and malevolence that characterize life are real, with the terrible 
consequences of the real—and our ability to solve problems, by 
confronting them and taking them on, is also real. By taking 
responsibility, we can find a meaningful path, improve our personal 
lot psychologically, and make what is intolerably wrong genuinely 
better. Thus, we can have our cake and eat it, too. 


RESPONSIBILITY AND MEANING 


The idea that life is suffering is a relatively universal truism of 
religious thinking. This is the first of the Four Noble Truths of 


Buddhism as well as a key Hindu concept. There is a tradition that 
the ancient Indian word for suffering—dukkha (from the Pali 
language) or duhka (from Sanskrit)—is derived from dus (bad) and 
kha (hole)—particularly the hole in a horse-drawn cart wheel, 
through which the axle passes. The proper place for such a hole is 
dead center, right on target. The ride is likely to be very bumpy, 
otherwise—with the bumps directly proportional in magnitude to 
the degree of offset. This is quite reminiscent, to me, of the Greek 
term hamartia, which is frequently translated as “sin,” in the 
context of Christian thought. 

Hamartia was originally an archery term, and it meant to miss 
the mark or target. There are many ways that a target can be missed. 
Frequently, in my clinical practice—and in my personal life—I 
observed that people did not get what they needed (or, equally 
importantly perhaps, what they wanted) because they never made it 
clear to themselves or others what that was. It is impossible to hit a 
target, after all, unless you aim at it. In keeping with this: People are 
more commonly upset by what they did not even try to do than by 
the errors they actively committed while engaging with the world.* 
At least if you misstep while doing something, you can learn from 
doing it wrong. But to remain passive in the face of life, even if you 
excuse your inaction as a means of avoiding error—that is a major 
mistake. As the great blues musician Tom Waits insists (in his song 
“A Little Rain”): “You must risk something that matters.” 

This is the colossal blunder made, for example, by the fictional 
Peter Pan. “Pan”—a name echoing the Greek god of the wilds— 
means “encompassing everything.” Peter Pan, the magical boy, is 
capable of everything. He is potential itself, like every child, and that 
makes him magical, in the same way that every child is magical. But 
time whittles that magic away, transforming the fascinating 
potentiality of childhood into the oft-apparently more mundane but 
genuine actuality of adulthood. The trick, so to speak, is to trade 
that early possibility for something meaningful, productive, long 
term, and sustainable. Peter Pan refuses to do so. This is at least in 
part because his major role model is Captain Hook. Captain Hook is 
the archetypal Tyrannical King, the pathology of order—a parasite 


and a tyrant, terrified of death. He has his reasons. Death stalks 
Hook in the form of a crocodile with a clock in his stomach. That is 
time: ticktock, ticktock. That is life vanishing, as the seconds march 
by. The crocodile has had a taste of Hook, too, and liked it. That is 
life, as well. It is not only cowards who are terrified by what lurks 
down in the chaotic depths. It is a rare person who has not suffered 
through disappointment, disease, and the death of a loved one by 
the time childhood ends. Such experiences can leave those who 
have had them bitter, resentful, predatory, and tyrannical—just like 
Hook. With a role model like the captain, it is no wonder Peter Pan 
does not want to grow up. Better to remain king of the Lost Boys. 
Better to remain lost in fantasy with Tinkerbell, who provides 
everything a female partner can provide—except that she does not 
exist. 

Wendy, the great love of Pan’s life, chooses to grow up, despite 
her admiration for her friend Peter. She takes a husband, facing— 
even welcoming—her maturation, and its lurking hints of mortality 
and death. She consciously chooses to sacrifice her childhood for 
the realities of adulthood, but gains real life in return. Peter remains 
a child: magical, to be sure, but still a child—and life, limited, finite, 
and unique, passes him by. In the J. M. Barrie play Peter Pan or The 
Boy Who Would Not Grow Up, Pan is portrayed as unafraid of 
death, which he faces on Marooners’ Rock. His attitude might be 
misunderstood by inattentive viewers as courage. After all, Pan says, 
“To die will be an awfully big adventure.”* But the psychologically 
insightful unseen narrator objects: “To live would be an awfully big 
adventure” (truly, a statement about what might have happened had 
the Boy King chosen Wendy), noting, immediately afterward, “but 
he can never quite get the hang of it.”* Pan’s hypothetical lack of 
fear of death is not courage, but the manifestation of his basically 
suicidal nature, the sickness of life (which he is constantly 
manifesting by his very refusal to mature). 

It is by no means a good thing to be the oldest person at the frat 
party. It is desperation, masquerading as cool rebelliousness—and 
there is a touchy despondence and arrogance that goes along with it. 
It smacks of Neverland. In the same manner, the attractive potential 


of a directionless but talented twenty-five-year-old starts to look 
hopeless and pathetic at thirty, and downright past its expiration 
date at forty. You must sacrifice something of your manifold 
potential in exchange for something real in life. Aim at something. 
Discipline yourself. Or suffer the consequence. And what is that 
consequence? All the suffering of life, with none of the meaning. Is 
there a better description of hell? 

Life is duhka for the Buddhists—equally, perhaps, although less 
explicitly, for the Hindus. The Hebrew Scriptures, for their part, 
chronicle the history of the suffering of the Jewish people, 
individually and as a nation, although the triumphs are not ignored. 
Even those who are called on by YHWH Himself to move into the 
adventure of life by no means escape catastrophe. Perhaps 
Abraham, the archetypal Patriarch, had an intuition of this. He was 
clearly something of a Peter Pan himself. The biblical account 
insists that Abraham stayed safely ensconced within his father’s 
tent until he was seventy-five years old (a late start, even by today’s 
standards). Then, called by God—inspired by the voice within, let us 
say, to leave family and country—he journeys forward into life. And 
what does he encounter, after heeding the divine call to adventure? 
First, famine. Then tyranny in Egypt; the potential loss of his 
beautiful wife to more powerful men; exile from his adopted 
country; conflicts over territory with his kinsmen; war, and the 
kidnapping of his nephew; extended childlessness (despite God’s 
promise to make him the progenitor of a great nation); and finally, 
terrible conflict between his spouses. 

The Abrahamic story made a great impact on me when I began to 
study and appreciate it more deeply. It has at its core a strange 
combination of pessimism and realistic, genuine encouragement. 
The pessimism? Even if you are called by God Himself to venture 
out into the world, as Abraham was, life is going to be exceptionally 
difficult. Even under the best of all conceivable circumstances, 
almost insuperable obstacles will emerge and obstruct your path. 
The encouragement? You will have the opportunity to reveal 
yourself as much stronger and more competent than you might 
imagine. There is a potential within you (some of that magic so 


evident in childhood) that will emerge when circumstances demand 
and transform you—God willing—into someone who can prevail. 

There is a very old idea, which I have only recently come to 
comprehend, at least in part. It is something you see manifested in 
many literary, imagistic, and dramatic forms, ancient and modern. It 
has to do with responsibility and meaning, but its true significance 
appears hidden, in precisely the same way that the wisdom dreams 
can bring forth is so often hidden. It is associated with the 
labyrinthine myth of the hero: He who speaks magic words, sees 
what others cannot (or refuse to see), overcomes the giant, leads his 
people, slays the dragon, finds the treasure hard to attain, and 
rescues the virgin. These are all variants of the same perceptual and 
behavioral pattern, which is an outline of the universally adaptive 
pattern of being. The hero is also he who rescues his father from the 
belly of the beast. What could this idea, expressed so commonly in 
narrative form, possibly mean? 


RESCUE YOUR FATHER: OSIRIS AND HORUS 


Consider the ancient Egyptian story of Osiris, Set, Isis, and Horus.* 
The Egyptians regarded Osiris as the founding deity of the state. 
You can profitably consider him to be an amalgam of all the 
personality characteristics of all the people who established the 
astonishing civilization on the Nile River. Osiris was worshipped as 
the culture-establishing hero, whose world-creating exploits as a 
young, vibrant god produced one of the first great and enduring 
civilizations. But he aged, as all things do, and became willfully 
blind. The Egyptians insisted that this crucially important figure in 
their mythology possessed both of these attributes—and that 
insistence constituted a great truth. The great founder-god became 
anachronistic but, more importantly, he began to close his eyes 
when he knew full well he should have kept them open. Osiris 
stopped paying attention to how his kingdom was being run. That 
was willful blindness, and there is no blaming that on mere age. It is 
a terrible temptation, as it allows for the sequestration into the 


future the trouble we could face today. That would be fine if trouble 
did not compound, like interest—but we all know that it does. 

Osiris’s decision to close his eyes when he should have kept them 
open exacted a brutally heavy price: subjugation to his evil brother, 
Set. The idea that the state had a malevolent brother was an axiom, 
we might say, of the Egyptian worldview—no doubt the 
consequence of a complex, long-standing civilization observing its 
own flaws—and something that has retained its relevance to the 
current day. Once a properly functional hierarchy has been 
established, an opportunity opens for its positions of authority to be 
usurped, not by people who have the competence demanded by the 
task at hand, but by those willing to use manipulation, deceit, and 
compulsion to gain status and control. It was all those 
counterproductive forces that the Egyptians were attempting to 
conceptualize in the figure of Set, the enemy of illumination, 
enlightenment, vision, and consciousness.®* It was Set’s greatest 
ambition to rule Egypt, to take the place of the rightful Pharaoh. By 
turning a blind eye to his evil brother’s machinations—by refusing 
to see—Osiris allowed Set to gain strength. This proved fatal (or as 
fatal as an error can be to an immortal). Set bided his time, until he 
caught Osiris in a moment of weakness. Then he dismembered him 
and scattered the pieces over the Egyptian countryside. It was not 
(is not) possible to finally kill Osiris, the eternal human impulse 
toward social organization. That is a force that will not die. But it is 
possible to break him into pieces—to make it difficult for him to get 
his act together—and that is exactly what Set managed. 

Osiris, god of order, falls apart. This happens all the time, in 
people’s individual lives, and equally in the history of families, 
cities, and states. Things fall apart when love affairs collapse, 
careers deteriorate, or cherished dreams die; when despair, anxiety, 
uncertainty, and hopelessness manifest themselves in the place of 
habitable order; and when nihilism and the abyss make their dread 
appearance, destroying the desirable and stable values of current 
life. Under such circumstances, chaos emerges. And that is why the 
goddess Isis, Queen of the Underworld and consort of Osiris, makes 
her appearance when Osiris is destroyed by Set. Isis scours the 


countryside, searching for the vital essence of Osiris. She finds it in 
the form of his dismembered phallus—vessel of the seminal idea, 
the spermatic word, the fructifying principle—and makes herself 
pregnant. What does this mean? The queen of the underworld, the 
goddess of chaos, is also the force that eternally renews. All the 
potential constrained by the previous system of apprehension, of 
category, of assumption—all the invisible limitation imposed upon 
the inhabitants of that orderly state—is released, for better and 
worse, when that system breaks into pieces. Thus, when the center 
will no longer hold—even at the darkest hour—new possibility 
makes itself manifest. It is for this reason that the archetypal Hero 
is born when things are at their worst. 

The now pregnant Isis returns to her home in the underworld and 
gives birth, in due time, to Horus, rightful son of the long-lost king, 
alienated as he matures from his now corrupted kingdom 
(something we all experience during our maturation). His primary 
attribute is the eye—the famous Egyptian single eye—while his 
avatar is the falcon, a bird that takes precise aim at its prey, strikes 
the target with deadly accuracy, and possesses an acuity of vision 
unparalleled in the kingdom of living things. More importantly, 
however, Horus has the will to see, along with the ability. This is 
courage itself: the refusal to shrink from what makes itself known, 
no matter how terrible it seems. Horus is the great god of attention, 
and the Egyptians determined, in their strange narrative manner— 
in a form of imaginative thinking that stretched over thousands of 
years—that the faculty of attention should rule over all others. 
Horus differs from Osiris, his father, in his willingness to see. He 
sees his uncle Set, for example, precisely for what he is. Set is pure 
malevolence; evil itself. Nonetheless, upon his maturity, Horus 
returns to the kingdom usurped from his father and confronts his 
uncle. They engage in an epic battle. The young god and rightful heir 
to the throne sees the opportunity lurking where responsibility has 
been abdicated, and is unwilling to look away. This is no feat for the 
faint of heart—not when it is taken all the way to its logical 
conclusion; not when the corruption and the willful blindness is 
exposed, all the way to the bottom. To look upon evil with eyes 


unshielded is dangerous beyond belief, regardless of how necessary 
it is to look. This is represented by Horus’s initial partial defeat: 
During their confrontation, Set tears out one of his courageous 
nephew’s eyes. 

Despite the damage he sustains, Horus emerges victorious. It is 
of vital importance to reiterate, in light of this victory, the fact that 
he enters the battle voluntarily. It is a maxim of clinical 
intervention—a consequence of observation of improvement in 
mental health across many schools of practical psychological 
thought—that voluntary confrontation with a feared, hated, or 
despised obstacle is curative. We become stronger by voluntarily 
facing what impedes our necessary progress. This does not mean 
“bite off more than you can chew” (any more than “voluntarily enter 
battle” means “seek conflict carelessly”). We are well advised to take 
on challenges at precisely the rate that engages and compels 
alertness, and forces the development of courage, skill, and talent, 
and to avoid foolhardy confrontation with that which lies beyond 
current comprehension. 

How is it possible to gauge the rate at which challenges should be 
sought? It is the instinct for meaning—something far deeper and 
older than mere thought—that holds the answer. Does what you are 
attempting compel you forward, without being too frightening? 
Does it grip your interest, without crushing you? Does it eliminate 
the burden of time passing? Does it serve those you love and, 
perhaps, even bring some good to your enemies? That is 
responsibility. Constrain evil. Reduce suffering. Confront the 
possibility that manifests in front of you every second of your life 
with the desire to make things better, regardless of the burden you 
bear, regardless of life’s often apparently arbitrary unfairness and 
cruelty. All other approaches merely deepen the pit, increase its 
heat, and doom those who inhabit it to continual worsening of their 
already serious problems. Everyone knows it. Everyone’s conscience 
proclaims it. Everyone’s true friend or loved one observes it and 
despairs when they see someone for whom they care failing to do 
what needs to be done. 


Horus takes his eye back from the defeated Set and banishes him 
beyond the borders of the kingdom. There is no killing Set. He is 
eternal as Osiris, eternal as Isis and Horus. The evil that threatens 
at all levels of experience is something—or someone—that everyone 
has to contend with always, psychologically and socially. But for a 
time evil can be overcome, banished, and defeated. Then peace and 
harmony can prevail for as long as people do not forget what 
brought them both about. 

Horus recovers his eye. A sensible person, in such a situation, 
would thank his lucky stars, place his eye back into its empty socket, 
and get on with his life. But that is not what Horus does. He returns, 
instead, to the underworld, to the belly of the beast, to the kingdom 
of the dead, where he knows he will find the spirit of Osiris. 
Dismembered though he may be, near death—even dead, in a sense 
—Osiris inhabits the underworld domain of chaos itself. That is the 
dead father in the belly of the beast. Horus finds the once-great king 
and grants to him the eye torn out by Set. Once again—because of 
the sacrifice and vision of his son—the ancient of days can see. 
Horus then takes his father, vision restored, and returns with him 
to the kingdom, so they can rule in tandem. The Egyptians insisted 
that it was this combination of vision, courage, and regenerated 
tradition that constituted the proper sovereign of the kingdom. It 
was this juxtaposition of wisdom and youth that comprised the 
essence of the power of the Pharaoh, his immortal soul, the source 
of his authority. 

When you face a challenge, you grapple with the world and 
inform yourself. This makes you more than you are. It makes you 
increasingly into who you could be. Who could you be? You could 
be all that a man or woman might be. You could be the newest 
avatar, in your own unique manner, of the great ancestral heroes of 
the past. What is the upper limit to that? We do not know. Our 
religious structures hint at it. What would a human being who was 
completely turned on, so to speak, be like? How would someone 
who determined to take full responsibility for the tragedy and 
malevolence of the world manifest himself? The ultimate question 
of Man is not who we are, but who we could be. 


When you peer into an abyss, you see a monster. If it is a small 
abyss, then it is a small monster. But if it is the ultimate abyss, then 
it is the ultimate monster. That is certainly a dragon—perhaps even 
the dragon of evil itself. The conceptualization of the monster in the 
abyss is the eternal predator lurking in the night, ready and able to 
devour its unsuspecting prey. That is an image that is tens of 
millions of years old, something coded as deeply in the recesses of 
our biological structure as anything conceptual can be coded. And it 
is not just the monsters of nature, but the tyrants of culture and the 
malevolence of individuals. It is all of that, with the latter dominant, 
terrible as that is to consider. And it is in the nature of mankind not 
to cower and freeze as helpless prey animals, nor to become a 
turncoat and serve evil itself, but to confront the lions in their lairs. 
That is the nature of our ancestors: immensely courageous hunters, 
defenders, shepherds, voyagers, inventors, warriors, and founders of 
cities and states. That is the father you could rescue; the ancestor 
you could become. And he is to be discovered in the deepest 
possible place, as that is where you must go if you wish to take full 
responsibility and become who you could be. 


AND WHO MIGHT THAT BE? 


Let us agree, to begin with, that you have a minimum moral 
obligation to take care of yourself. Maybe you are just selfishly 
interested in taking care of yourself. But then the questions arise: 
What do you mean by “care”? Which “yourself” are you talking 
about? We will just consider pure selfishness to begin with, 
uncontaminated self-interest. That keeps it simple. That means, for 
starters, that you are free do anything you want—because you do 
not have to care about anyone else. But then something in you 
might well object: “Wait just a moment. That will not work.” Why 
not? Well, which self are you taking care of? Are you taking care of 
the you that specifically exists this minute? What will happen, then, 
in the next? Because the future is coming, as certainly, for all 


intents and purposes, as the sun rises in the morning. And you are 
best advised to be ready for it. 

You know the risks if you choose to maximize now at the expense 
of later. Imagine that you are about to utter something thoughtless 
and angry. You think, “Take no prisoners,” and say whatever comes 
to mind, no matter how unjust and cruel. You experience a release 
of positive emotion and enthusiasm along with that, as well as the 
satisfying venting of resentment. Immediately thereafter, however, 
you are in trouble, and that trouble might stick around for a very 
long time. You have clearly not acted in your best interests, even 
though you did just what you selfishly wanted to. And no one with 
any sense tells their beloved son or daughter, “Look, kid, just do 
exactly what feels good in the moment, and to hell with everything 
else. It does not matter.” You do not say that, because you know full 
well that the future is coming for your child as surely as it comes for 
you. The mere fact that something makes you happy in the moment 
does not mean that it is in your best interest, everything considered. 
Life would be simple if that were the case. But there is the you now, 
and the you tomorrow, and the you next week, and next year, and in 
five years, and in a decade—and you are required by harsh necessity 
to take all of those “yous” into account. That is the curse associated 
with the human discovery of the future and, with it, the necessity of 
work—because to work means to sacrifice the hypothetical delights 
of the present for the potential improvement of what lies ahead. 

Now, there is some utility in discounting the importance of the 
“yous” who exist far enough into the future, because the future is 
uncertain. It is not the case that you should be as concerned about 
the effects of your current actions twenty years down the road as 
you are now, because there is a very high probability that you are 
here right now (if you are reading this) and somewhat less of a 
chance that you will be around then. And then there are the errors 
of prediction you will make when looking so far ahead. But the 
mounting uncertainty of distance in time does not stop sensible 
people from preparing for their later years. Here is what the future 
means: If you are going to take care of yourself, you are already 
burdened (or privileged) with a social responsibility. The you for 


whom you are caring is a community that exists across time. The 
necessity for considering this society of the individual, so to speak, 
is a burden and an opportunity that seems uniquely characteristic of 
human beings. 

Animals do not seem to consider the future in the same manner 
as we do. If you visit the African veldt, and you observe a herd of 
zebras, you will often see lions lazing about around them. And as 
long as the lions are lying around relaxing, the zebras really do not 
mind. This attitude seems a little thoughtless, from the human 
perspective. The zebras should instead be biding their time until the 
lions go to sleep. Then they should run off to a corner of the field in 
a herd and conspire a bit. And then several dozen of them should 
rush the sleeping lions and stomp them to death. That would be the 
end of the lion problem. But that is not what zebras do. They think, 
“Ah, look at those relaxed lions! Relaxed lions are never a problem!” 
Zebras do not seem to have any real sense of time. They cannot 
conceptualize themselves across the temporal expanse. But human 
beings not only manage such conceptualization, they cannot shake 
it. We discovered the future, some long time ago—and now the 
future is where we each live, in potential. We treat that as reality. It 
is a reality that only might be—but it is one with a high probability 
of becoming now, eventually, and we are driven to take that into 
account. 

You are stuck with yourself. You are burdened with who you are 
right now and who you are going to be in the future. That means 
that if you are treating yourself properly, you must consider your 
repetition across time. You are destined to play a game with yourself 
today that must not interfere with the game you play tomorrow, 
next month, next year, and so on. Thus, narrow selfishness is 
destined to be nonproductive. It is for this reason, among others, 
that a strictly individualist ethic is a contradiction in terms. There is 
in fact little difference between how you should treat yourself—once 
you realize that you are a community that extends across time—and 
how you should treat other people. 

In a marriage, for example, you face the same problem with your 
marital partner as you do with yourself: You are stuck with the 


consequences of an iterating game. You can treat your husband or 
wife any old way right now, this moment, no matter how horrid and 
thoughtless that way might be, but you are going to wake up with 
him or her tomorrow, and next month, and a decade from now (and, 
if not that person, then someone else equally unfortunate). If you 
treat the person you are committed to in a manner that does not 
work when it is repeated across time, then you are playing a 
degenerating game, and you are both going to suffer terribly for it. 
This problem is not materially different from failing to make peace 
with your future self. The consequences are identical. 


HAPPINESS AND RESPONSIBILITY 


People want to be happy, and no wonder. I have longed deeply, 
many times, for the return of happiness—hoping for its current 
presence—and I am certainly not alone in that. However, I do not 
believe you should pursue happiness. If you do so, you will run right 
into the iteration problem, because “happy” is a right-now thing. If 
you place people in situations where they are feeling a lot of positive 
emotion, they get present-focused and impulsive.* This means 
“make hay while the sun shines”—take your opportunities while 
things are good and act now. But now is by no means everything, 
and unfortunately, everything must be considered, at least insofar 
as you are able. In consequence, it is unlikely that whatever 
optimizes your life across time is happiness. I am not denying its 
desirability, by the way. If happiness comes to you, welcome it with 
gratitude and open arms (but be careful, because it does make you 
impetuous). 

What might serve as a more sophisticated alternative to 
happiness? Imagine it is living in accordance with the sense of 
responsibility, because that sets things right in the future. Imagine, 
as well, that you must act reliably, honestly, nobly, and in 
relationship to a higher good, in order to manifest the sense of 
responsibility properly. The higher good would be the simultaneous 
optimization of your function and the function of the people around 


you, across time, as we have discussed previously. That is the 
highest good. Imagine that you make that aim conscious, that you 
articulate that aim as an explicit goal. Then a question arises: “What 
is the consequence of that psychologically?” 

First, consider that most of the positive emotion people 
experience does not come from attaining something. There is the 
simple pleasure (more accurately, the satisfaction) that comes from 
having a good meal when hungry, and there is the more complex 
but similar satisfaction that is associated with accomplishing 
something difficult and worthwhile. Imagine, for example, that you 
graduate from grade 12. Graduation Day marks the event. It is a 
celebration. But the next day that is over, and you immediately face 
a new Set of problems (just as you are hungry again only a few 
hours after a satisfying meal). You are no longer king of the high 
school: you are bottom dog in the work force, or a freshman at a 
postsecondary institution. You are in the position of Sisyphus. You 
strove and struggled to push your boulder to the pinnacle, and you 
find yourself, instead, at the foot of the mountain. 

There is a near-instantaneous transformation that comes as a 
consequence of attainment. Like impulsive pleasure, attainment 
will produce positive emotion. But, also like pleasure, attainment is 
unreliable. Another question thus emerges: “What is a truly reliable 
source of positive emotion?” The answer is that people experience 
positive emotion in relationship to the pursuit of a valuable goal. 
Imagine you have a goal. You aim at something. You develop a 
strategy in relationship to that aim, and then you implement it. And 
then, as you implement the strategy, you observe that it is working. 
That is what produces the most reliable positive emotion.® Imagine 
over time that the attitudes and actions that manage this most 
effectively (in a competition that is very Darwinian) come, 
eventually, to dominate over all others.* Imagine that is true 
psychologically and socially, simultaneously. Imagine that this 
occurs in your own life, but also across the centuries, as everyone 
interacts and talks and raises a particular mode of being to primary 
status. 


This implies something crucial: no happiness in the absence of 
responsibility. No valuable and valued goal, no positive emotion. 
You might object, “Well, what exactly constitutes a valid goal?” 
Imagine that you are pursuing something pleasurable, but short 
term and trivial. The wise part of you will be comparing that pursuit 
to the possible goal of acting in the best interest of your community 
of future selves and your community of other people. Perhaps you 
are unwilling to allow yourself to realize that wisdom: You do not 
wish to bear the responsibility—not in place of an immediate, 
impulsive focus on pleasure. You are fooling yourself, however, 
especially at the deeper levels of your being, if you believe such 
avoidance will prove successful. The wise and ancient parts of you, 
seriously concerned with your survival, are neither easy to deceive 
nor to set aside. But you take aim at a trivial goal anyway, and 
develop a rather shallow strategy to attain it, only to find it is not 
satisfying because you do not care enough. It does not matter to you 
—not deeply. Furthermore, the fact that you are not pursuing the 
goal you should rightly be pursuing means that you are feeling 
guilty, ashamed, and lesser at the same time. 

This is not a helpful strategy. It is not going to work. I have never 
met anyone who was satisfied when they knew they were not doing 
everything they should be doing. We are temporally aware 
creatures: We know that we are continually and inescapably playing 
an iterated game from which we cannot easily hide. No matter how 
much we wish to discount the future completely, it is part of the 
price we paid for being acutely self-conscious and able to 
conceptualize ourselves across the entire span of our lives. We are 
stuck with it. There is no escaping from the future—and when you 
are stuck with something and there is no escaping from it, the right 
attitude is to turn around voluntarily and confront it. That works. 
And so, instead of your short-term impulsive goal, you lay out a 
much larger-scale goal, which is to act properly in relationship to 
the long term for everyone. 


PICK UP THE EXTRA WEIGHT 


There is a proper way to behave—an ethic—and you are destined to 
contend with it. You cannot help but calculate yourself across time, 
and everyone else across time, and you are reporting back to 
yourself, inevitably, on your own behavior and misbehavior. What 
works across multiple time frames and multiple places for multiple 
people (including yourself)—that is the goal. It is an emergent ethic, 
hard to formulate explicitly, but inescapable in its existence and its 
consequences, and an ineradicably deep part of the game of Being. 
Great players are attractive. Attractive people attract mates. The 
closer we match the pattern—the emergent pattern—the more likely 
we are to survive and protect our families. The playing field selects 
the players on the basis of their ethical behavior. And we are 
therefore biologically prepared to respond positively to and to 
imitate the Great Player—and to disapprove, even violently, of the 
deceiver, the cheat, and the fraud. And it is your conscience—your 
instinct for moral virtue—that indicates deviation from the path. 
When your child purposefully trips an opponent during a soccer 
game, or fails to pass to an open teammate with a great opportunity 
to score, you frown. You feel shame, as you should, because you are 
witnessing the betrayal of someone you love, by someone you love— 
and that is your child’s self-betrayal. Something similar occurs 
when you violate your own sense of propriety. It is the same 
instinct, and it is best attended to. If you do not follow the right 
path, you will wander off a cliff and suffer miserably—and there is 
simply no way that the most profound parts of yourself are going to 
allow that without protest. 

You might rationalize: “There is no cliff here now. There is no 
cliff I can see nearby. And a cliff I will not tumble off for ten years is 
a long way away.” But the part of your psyche that is most profound 
invariably objects: “Such thinking is not appropriate. It will not do. 
What is ten years away is still real, despite its distance (allowing for 
unavoidable errors of prediction). If there is a catastrophe waiting 
there, we are not going to aim at it now. Not without objection.” If 
your behavior suggests that you are tilting in that direction, then 


you are going to feel guilty and horrible about it, if you are lucky 
and even minimally awake. And thank God for that. If the cost of 
betraying yourself, in the deepest sense, is guilt, shame, and anxiety, 
the benefit of not betraying yourself is meaning—the meaning that 
sustains. That is the most valuable of opportunities that lurks where 
responsibility has been abdicated. 

If you attend to your conscience, you will begin to determine that 
some of the things you are doing are wrong. More precisely: if you 
are alerted to the possibility of your own wrongdoing by your 
conscience, and you then begin to engage in a true dialogue with 
that same agent, you will begin to develop a clear picture of what is 
wrong—and, by implication, of what is right. Right is not least the 
opposite of wrong—and wrong is in some clear sense more blatant 
and obvious. A sense of right can therefore be developed and honed 
through careful attention to what is wrong. You act and betray 
yourself, and you feel bad about that. You do not know exactly why. 
You try to avoid thinking about it, because it is less painful and 
easier in the short term not to think about it. You try with all your 
might to ignore it, but all that does is increase your sense of self- 
betrayal and further divide you against yourself. 

So, you reconsider, perhaps, and you confront your discomfort. 
You note your disunity and the chaos that comes with it. You ask 
yourself—you pray to discover—what you did wrong. And the 
answer arrives. And it is not what you want. And part of you must 
therefore die, so that you can change. And the part that must die 
struggles for its existence, puts forward its rationale, and pleads its 
case. And it will do so with every trick in its possession—employing 
the most egregious lies, the bitterest, most resentment-eliciting 
memories of the past, and the most hopelessly cynical attitudes 
about the future (indeed, about the value of life itself). But you 
persevere, and discriminate, judge, and decide exactly why what you 
did was wrong, and you start to understand, by contrast, what might 
have been right. And then you determine to start acting in 
accordance with your conscience. You decide that it is a partner, 
despite its adversarial form. You put all that you have discovered to 
be right into action, and you begin your ascent. You start to monitor 


yourself, ever more careful to ensure you are doing the right thing— 
listening to what you say, watching yourself act, trying not to 
deviate from the straight and narrow path. That becomes your goal. 

An idea begins to take shape: “I am going to live my life properly. 
I am going to aim at the good. I am going to aim at the highest good 
I can possible manage.” Now, all the parts of you taking care of your 
future self are on board. You are all aimed in one direction. You are 
no longer a house divided against itself. You are standing solidly on 
a firm foundation. You are no longer so easy to dissuade or 
discourage. Your resolution trumps your nihilism and despair. The 
struggle you have had with your own tendency to doubt and 
dissimulate protects you against the unwarranted and cynical 
criticisms of others. There is a high goal, a mountain peak, a star 
that shines in the darkness, beckoning above the horizon. Its mere 
existence gives you hope—and that is the meaning without which 
you cannot live. 

Remember Pinocchio? When Geppetto wants to transform the 
wooden-headed puppet he created into something real, he first 
raises his eyes above the horizon and wishes on a star. It is the same 
star that announces Pinocchio’s birth at the beginning of the movie 
and whose light is reflected in the golden badge granted to Jiminy 
Cricket at the close. It is the same star, symbolically speaking, that 
announces the birth of Christ in the depths of the darkness. 
Geppetto focuses on the star and makes a wish. The wish is that his 
marionette with strings controlled by someone or something else 
will become real. The story of the puppet and his temptations and 
trials is a psychological drama. We all understand it, even though 
we cannot necessarily articulate that understanding. It is necessary 
to lift your eyes above the horizon, to establish a transcendent goal, 
if you wish to cease being a puppet, under the control of things you 
do not understand and perhaps do not want to understand. Then all 
the subsystems or subpersonalities that might otherwise be pursing 
their own limited fulfillment will join together under the aegis of 
the truly ideal, and the consequence of that will be an engagement 
that approximates the ultimate or total. Under such conditions, all 
the parts of you are going to be on board. That is the psychological 


equivalent of monotheism. That is the emergence of the higher self 
that might be the true servant of God, in whatever metaphysical 
reality potentially underlies what is obvious to our blind and limited 
mortal selves. 

What is the antidote to the suffering and malevolence of life? The 
highest possible goal. What is the prerequisite to pursuit of the 
highest possible goal? Willingness to adopt the maximum degree of 
responsibility—and this includes the responsibilities that others 
disregard or neglect. You might object: “Why should I shoulder all 
that burden? It is nothing but sacrifice, hardship, and trouble.” But 
what makes you so sure you do not want something heavy to carry? 
You positively need to be occupied with something weighty, deep, 
profound, and difficult. Then, when you wake up in the middle of 
the night and the doubts crowd in, you have some defense: “For all 
my flaws, which are manifold, at least I am doing this. At least I am 
taking care of myself. At least I am of use to my family, and to the 
other people around me. At least I am moving, stumbling upward, 
under the load I have determined to carry.” You can attain some 
genuine self-respect that way—but it is not a mere shallow 
psychological construct that has to do with how you are construing 
yourself in the moment. It is far deeper than that—and it is not only 
psychological. It is real, as well as psychological. 

Your life becomes meaningful in precise proportion to the depths 
of the responsibility you are willing to shoulder. That is because you 
are now genuinely involved in making things better. You are 
minimizing the unnecessary suffering. You are encouraging those 
around you, by example and word. You are constraining the 
malevolence in your own heart and the hearts of others. A 
bricklayer may question the utility of laying his bricks, 
monotonously, one after another. But perhaps he is not merely 
laying bricks. Maybe he is building a wall. And the wall is part of a 
building. And the building is a cathedral. And the purpose of the 
cathedral is the glorification of the Highest Good. And under such 
circumstances, every brick laid is an act that partakes of the divine. 
And if what you are doing in your day-to-day activity is not enough, 
then you are not aiming at the construction of a proper cathedral. 


And that is because you are not aiming high enough. Because if you 
were, then you would experience the sense of meaning in 
relationship to your sufficiently high goal, and it would justify the 
misery and limitations of your life. If you have something 
meaningful to pursue, then you are engrossed in life. You are on a 
meaningful path. The most profound and reliable instinct for 
meaning—if not perverted by self-deceit and sin (there is no other 
way to state it)—manifests itself when you are on the path of 
maximum virtue. 

The sense of meaning is an indicator that you are on that path. It 
is an indication that all the complexity that composes you is lined 
up within you, and aimed at something worth pursuing—something 
that balances the world, something that produces harmony. It is 
something you hear made manifest in music, and the profound 
sense of meaning that music intrinsically produces. Maybe you are a 
nihilistic death-metal punk. You are deeply skeptical and 
pessimistic. You find meaning nowhere. You hate everything, just 
on principle. But then your favorite nihilistic death-metal punk 
band lead guitarist and his bandmates start to blast out their 
patterned harmonies—each in alignment with the other—and you 
are caught! “Ah, I do not believe in anything—but, God, that music!” 
And the lyrics are destructive and nihilistic and cynical and bitter 
and hopeless but it does not matter, because the music beckons and 
calls to your spirit, and fills it with the intimation of meaning, and 
moves you, so that you align yourself with the patterns, and you nod 
your head and tap your feet to the beat, participating despite 
yourself. It is those patterns of sound, layered one on top of 
another, harmoniously, moving in the same direction, predictably 
and unpredictably, in perfect balance: order and chaos, in their 
eternal dance. And you dance with it, no matter how scornful you 
are. You align yourself with that patterned, directional harmony. 
And in that you find the meaning that sustains. 

You are possessed of an instinct—a spirit—that orients you 
toward the highest good. It calls your soul away from hell and 
toward heaven. And because it is there, you find yourself frequently 
disillusioned. People disappoint you. You betray yourself; you lose a 


meaningful connection to your workplace, boss, or partner. You 
think, “The world is not set right. It is deeply troubling to me.” That 
very disenchantment, however, can serve as the indicator of destiny. 
It speaks of abdicated responsibility—of things left undone, of 
things that still need to be done. You are irritated about that need. 
You are annoyed with the government, you are embittered and 
resentful about your job, you are unhappy with your parents, and 
you are frustrated with all these people around you who will not 
take on responsibility. There are, after all, things that are crying out 
to be accomplished. You are outraged that what needs to be done is 
not being done. That anger—that outrage—is, however, a doorway. 
That observation of abdicated responsibility is the indication of 
destiny and meaning. The part of you that is oriented toward the 
highest good is pointing out the disjunction between the ideal you 
can imagine—the ideal that is possessing you—and the reality you 
are experiencing. There is a gap there, and it is communicating its 
need to be filled. You can give way to fury, in consequence, and 
blame it on someone else—and it is not as if other people are not 
contributing to the problems. Or you can come to understand that 
your very disappointment is an indication to you from the most 
fundamental levels of your being that there is something wrong that 
needs to be set right—and, perhaps, by you. What is it, that concern, 
that care, that irritation, that distraction? It is not the call to 
happiness. It is the call to the action and adventure that make up a 
real life. Consider, once again, the biblical story of Abraham. God 
comes to Abraham, and says, 


Go from your country, your people and your father’s 
household to the land I will show you. 

I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you; 
I will make your name great, and you will be a blessing. 

I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses 
you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed 
through you. (Genesis 12:1—3) 


That late bloomer Abraham has been hanging around his father’s 
tent for far too many years, to put it mildly. But if God’s call comes, 
it is better to heed it, no matter how late (and in that, there is real 
hope, for those who believe that they have delayed too long). 
Abraham leaves his country, and his people, and his father’s 
household, and journeys out into the world, following the still small 
voice; following God’s call. And it is no call to happiness. It is the 
complete bloody catastrophe we previously described: famine, war, 
and domestic strife. All this might make the reasonable individual 
(not to mention Abraham himself) doubt the wisdom of listening to 
God and conscience, and of adopting the responsibility of autonomy 
and the burden of adventure. Better to be lying in a hammock, 
devouring peeled grapes in the security of Dad’s tent. What calls you 
out into the world, however—to your destiny—is not ease. It is 
struggle and strife. It is bitter contention and the deadly play of the 
opposites. It is probable—inevitable—that the adventure of your life 
will frustrate and disappoint and unsettle you, as you heed the call 
of conscience and shoulder your responsibility and endeavor to set 
yourself and the world right. But that is where the deep meaning 
that orients you and shelters you is to be found. That is where 
things will line up for you; where things that have been scattered 
apart and broken will come together; where purpose will manifest 
itself; where what is proper and good will be supported and what is 
weak and resentful and arrogant and destructive will be defeated. 
That is where the life that is worth living is to be eternally found— 
and where you can find it, personally, if only you are willing. 

Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been 
abdicated. 


RULE V 


DO NOT DO WHAT YOU HATE 


PATHOLOGICAL ORDER IN ITS DAY-TO-DAY GUISE 


I once had a client who was subject to a barrage of constant idiocy 
as part of her work in a giant corporation. She was a sensible, 
honest person who had withstood and managed a difficult life and 
who genuinely wished to contribute and work in a manner 
commensurate with her good sense and honesty. She became 
subject while employed in the corporate environment to a long, in- 
person and email-mediated dispute about whether the term “flip 
chart” (a common phrase, referring to a large pad of paper sheets, 
typically supported by a tripod) was in fact a term of abuse. For 
those of you who still find it difficult to believe that conversations 
such as this occupy the hours of corporate workers, try a quick 
Google search. “Flip chart derogatory” will suffice. You will see 
immediately that concern about this issue genuinely and rather 
widely exists. Many meetings were held by her superiors at work to 
discuss this issue. 

“Flip” was apparently at one time a derogatory term for Filipino (1 
could find little evidence for its use now). Even though the former 
slur has nothing whatsoever to do with “flip chart,” the 
administrators of her firm felt that their time was well spent 
discussing the hypothetically prejudicial nature of the phrase and 
formulating a replacement term, the use of which eventually 
became mandatory among employees. This was all despite the fact 
that no employee of Filipino nationality or descent had ever 


complained about the corporation’s use of the term. According to 
the Global Language Monitor (languagemonitor.com), which 
monitors but does not approve politically correct word usage, the 
proper term is now “writing block,” despite the fact that a flip chart 
is in no way a “block.” 

In any case, the corporation in question settled on “easel pad,” 
which seems somewhat more descriptively accurate—not that this 
comparatively elegant solution detracts from the foolishness in 
question. After all, we are still left with “flip-flopped,” “flippant,” 
“flip-flops,” “flippers,” and so on, and at least the first two of those 
sound more derogatory on first exposure than “flip chart,” if we are 
going to concern ourselves with such things. Now, you might 
wonder: “What difference does this minor change in terminology 
really make? It is a trivial problem. Why would someone become 
concerned about the fact that such change is being discussed? Why 
not ignore it, as it is best to ignore so much folly, and concentrate 
on something of more importance?” Because, of course, you could 
claim that paying attention to someone attending to such issues is 
as much a waste of time as attending to the discussion in the first 
place. And I would say that is precisely the conundrum Rule V is 
trying to address. When do you stop participating in a worrisome 
process that you see, or think you see, unfolding in front of you? 

My client first wrote me about the fact that not only was the 
string of communication discussing the use of “flip chart” well 
received by her coworkers, but that a contest of sorts immediately 
emerged to identify and communicate additional words that might 
also be offensive.* “Blackboard” was mentioned, as was “master 
key” (the former perhaps because referring to anything as “black”— 
even if it is black—is somehow racist in our hypersensitive times; 
the latter because of its hypothetical relationship to terminology 
historically associated with slavery). My client tried to make sense 
of what she was witnessing: “Such discussions give people the 
superficial sense of being good, noble, compassionate, openhearted, 
and wise. So, if for the sake of argument anyone disagrees, how 
could that person join the discussion without being considered 
anticompassionate, narrow minded, racist and wicked?” 


She was also perturbed because no one at her workplace was 
apparently bothered that any given group of people might endow 
themselves with the authority to ban words (and to disdain or even 
discipline those who continued to use them) without perceiving any 
ethical overreach on their part, and without perceiving the danger of 
such censorship, which could easily extend, say, to personal 
opinions, topics of conversation—or, for that matter, books. Finally, 
she believed that the entire discussion constituted a prime example 
of “diversity,” “inclusivity,” and “equity”—terms that had become 
veritable mantras for the departments of Human Resources or 
Learning and Development (the latter of which she worked for). She 
regarded them as “engines of corporate indoctrination and 
ideological propaganda” and as part of the manner in which the 
political correctness that characterizes, above all, many university 
programs extends its reach into the broader culture. More 
importantly, however, she asked me in one of her letters, “Is this a 
case where enough is enough?” When and where do we stop? If a 
tiny minority of people even hypothetically finds some words 
offensive, then what? Do we continue to ban words endlessly?” 

What my client was perceiving—at least as far as she was 
concerned—was not a single event, hypothetically capable of 
heading those involved in it down a dangerous path, but a clearly 
identifiable and causally related variety or sequence of events, all 
heading in the same direction. Those events seemed to form a 
coherent pattern, associated with an ideology that was directional in 
its intent, explicitly and implicitly. Furthermore, the effect of that 
directionality had been manifesting itself, by all appearances, for a 
reasonable amount of time, not only in the corporate world my 
client inhabited, but in the broader world of social and political 
institutions surrounding the corporation for which she worked. 
Although rather isolated in the department she happened to work in 
(the very epicenter of the ideological blitz of the corporation in 
question), she could see around her evidence that the processes 
disturbing her were also having a detrimental effect on other 
people. And then there was the effect on her conscience. It is 
important to understand that these issues were not minor 


philosophical concepts to her. They were bothering her deeply and 
upsetting her life. 

It is, of course, the case that being required to do stupid, hateful 
things is demoralizing. Someone assigned a pointless or even 
counterproductive task will deflate, if they have any sense, and find 
within themselves very little motivation to carry out the 
assignment. Why? Because every fiber of their genuine being fights 
against that necessity. We do the things we do because we think 
those things important, compared to all the other things that could 
be important. We regard what we value as worthy of sacrifice and 
pursuit. That worthiness motivates us to act, despite the fact that 
action is difficult and dangerous. When we are called upon to do 
things that we find hateful and stupid, we are simultaneously forced 
to act contrary to the structure of values motivating us to move 
forward stalwartly and protecting us from dissolution into 
confusion and terror. “To thine own self be true,” as Polonius has 
it, in Shakespeare’s Hamlet. That “self’—that integrated psyche—is 
in truth the ark that shelters us when the storms gather and the 
water rises. To act in violation of its precepts—its fundamental 
beliefs—is to run our own ship onto the shoals of destruction. To act 
in violation of the precepts of that fundamental self is to cheat in 
the game we play with ourselves, to suffer the emptiness of 
betrayal, and to perceive abstractly and then experience in embodied 
form the loss that is inevitably to come. 

What price did my client pay for her initial subjugation to the 
arbitrary dictates of her managers? She was an immigrant from a 
former Soviet bloc country and had experienced more than a 
sufficient taste of authoritarian ideology. In consequence, her 
inability to determine how she might object to what was happening 
left her feeling both weak and complicit. Furthermore, no sensible 
person could possibly remain motivated to put forth effort 
anywhere such as her workplace had become, where absurdities of a 
conceptual sort were not only continually occurring but encouraged 
or, even worse, required. Such “action” makes a mockery of 
productive work itself—even the very idea of productive work (and 
that is in fact part of the true motivation for such behavior: those 


jealous of genuine competence and productivity have every reason 
to undermine and denigrate even the concept of both). So, what did 
she do about the demoralizing state in which she found herself? 

My client did not feel sufficiently confident in her position or in 
the ability of her managers to engage in a genuine conversation with 
them about her objections, although it was clear from my 
conversations with her that she wished very much to escape from 
the situation. In consequence, she began to develop what might be 
considered a rearguard action. She was already involved in 
developing in-house education projects for the company, as we 
mentioned. It was possible for her, therefore, to begin to branch out, 
offering her services as a speaker at a variety of corporate 
conferences. Although she never directly confronted the flip chart 
issue (and may have been wise to avoid doing so), she began to 
speak out against the kind of pseudoscience that characterizes many 
of the ideas that corporate managers, particularly in Human 
Resources departments, regard as valid. She presented a number of 
talks, for example, criticizing the widespread fad of “learning 
styles”—a theory predicated on the idea that there are between four 
and eight different modalities that individuals prefer and that aid 
them if used when they are trying to master new ideas. These 
include, for example, visual, auditory, verbal, physical, and logical, 
among others. 

The problem with the learning styles theory? Most basically: 
there is simply no evidence whatsoever for its validity. First, 
although students may express a preference for information being 
delivered in one form over another, practically delivering it in that 
form does not improve their academic performance.* Second (and 
this makes sense, given the first problem), there is no evidence that 
teachers can accurately assess the “learning style” of their students.* 
So, although it was not possible for my client to directly confront 
the particular foolishness that was disturbing her, after long 
strategizing and much work she did manage to push back very 
effectively against the ignorance that characterized what passed for 
psychological knowledge among a substantial subset of her 
coworkers (as well as those who worked in other companies, where 


the same things were taking place). She had also done some work as 
a journalist for one of the major newspapers in Albania, her country 
of origin, and began to make continuing to do so a higher priority. 
This did not pay well, but she developed a stellar professional 
reputation there, and fought hard in print for what she believed in, 
warning the citizens of her once-Communist-dominated state of the 
move toward totalitarian opinion beginning to make itself attractive 
to people in the West. 

What price did she pay for her decision to stand up and fight? To 
begin with, she had to face her fear of reprisal, as well as the fact 
that such fear—in combination with the profound distaste she felt 
for the ideological maneuvers characterizing her workplace—was 
destroying her interest in her office profession, as well as making 
her feel inadequate and cowardly. Then, she had to broaden her 
professional activities: first, taking the risk of offering herself as a 
speaker at corporate conventions (and people are generally very 
loath to talk publicly—it is a common fear, often severe enough to 
interfere with career progression“); second, mastering the literature, 
enabling her to speak in a credible and informed manner; and third, 
presenting material that, given its critical nature, was bound to 
offend a reasonable proportion of those in the audience (precisely 
those who had accepted and who were propagating the theories that 
she was now discrediting). This all meant the facing of her fear—of 
inaction, as well as action. These moves challenged her deeply—but 
the consequence was an expansion of personality and competence, 
as well as the knowledge that she was making a genuine social 
contribution. 

I believe that the good that people do, small though it may 
appear, has more to do with the good that manifests broadly in the 
world than people think, and I believe the same about evil. We are 
each more responsible for the state of the world than we believe, or 
would feel comfortable believing. Without careful attention, culture 
itself tilts toward corruption. Tyranny grows slowly, and asks us to 
retreat in comparatively tiny steps. But each retreat increases the 
possibility of the next retreat. Each betrayal of conscience, each act 
of silence (despite the resentment we feel when silenced), and each 


rationalization weakens resistance and increases the probability of 
the next restrictive move forward. This is particularly the case when 
those pushing forward delight in the power they have now acquired 
—and such people are always to be found. Better to stand forward, 
awake, when the costs are relatively low—and, perhaps, when the 
potential rewards have not yet vanished. Better to stand forward 
before the ability to do so has been irretrievably compromised. 
Unfortunately, people often act in spite of their conscience—even if 
they know it—and hell tends to arrive step by step, one betrayal 
after another. And it should be remembered that it is rare for people 
to stand up against what they know to be wrong even when the 
consequences for doing so are comparatively slight. And this is 
something to deeply consider, if you are concerned with leading a 
moral and careful life: if you do not object when the transgressions 
against your conscience are minor, why presume that you will not 
willfully participate when the transgressions get truly out of hand? 

Part of moving Beyond Order is knowing when you have such a 
reason. Part of moving Beyond Order is understanding that your 
conscience has a primary claim on your action, which supersedes 
your conventional social duty. If you decide to stand up and refuse a 
command, if you do something of which others disapprove but you 
firmly believe to be correct, you must be in a position to trust 
yourself. This means that you must have attempted to live an 
honest, meaningful, productive life (of precisely the sort that might 
characterize someone else you would tend to trust). If you have 
acted honorably, so that you are a trustworthy person, it will be your 
decision to refuse to comply or to act in a manner contrary to public 
expectation that will help society itself maintain its footing. By 
doing so you can be part of the force of truth that brings corruption 
and tyranny to a halt. The sovereign individual, awake and attending 
to his or her conscience, is the force that prevents the group, as the 
necessary structure guiding normative social relations, from 
becoming blind and deadly. 

I do not want to end this section on a falsely optimistic note. I 
know from further correspondence with my client that she shifted 
her employment from one large organization to another several 


times in the years that followed. In one case, she found a good 
position, where it was possible to engage in productive, sensible, 
meaningful work. However, although successful there, she was laid 
off during a corporate reorganization, and has since found the other 
companies she has worked for as thoroughly possessed by the 
current linguistic and identity-politics fads as her original place of 
employment. Some dragons are everywhere, and they are not easy 
to defeat. But her attempts to fight back—her work debunking 
pseudoscientific theories; her work as a journalist—helped buttress 
her against depression and bolster her self-regard. 


FORTIFY YOUR POSITION 


When culture disintegrates—because it refuses to be aware of its 
own pathology; because the visionary hero is absent—it descends 
into the chaos that underlies everything. Under such conditions, the 
individual can dive voluntarily as deeply as he or she dares into the 
depths and rediscover the eternal principles renewing vision and 
life. The alternative is despair, corruption, and nihilism— 
thoughtless subjugation to the false words of totalitarian 
utopianism and life as a miserable, lying, and resentful slave. 

If you wish instead to be engaged in a great enterprise—even if 
you regard yourself as a mere cog—you are required not to do things 
you hate. You must fortify your position, regardless of its meanness 
and littleness, confront the organizational mendacity undermining 
your spirit, face the chaos that ensues, rescue your near-dead father 
from the depths, and live a genuine and truthful life. Otherwise, 
nature hides her face, society stultifies, and you remain a 
marionette, with your strings pulled by demonic forces operating 
behind the scenes—and one more thing: it is your fault. No one is 
destined in the deterministic sense to remain a puppet. 

We are not helpless. Even in the rubble of the most broken-down 
lives, useful weapons might still be found. Likewise, even the giant 
most formidable in appearance may not be as omnipotent as it 
proclaims or appears. Allow for the possibility that you may be able 


to fight back; that you may be able to resist and maintain your soul 
—and perhaps even your job. (But a better job may also beckon if 
you can tolerate the idea of the transformation.) If you are willing to 
conceptualize yourself as someone who could—and, perhaps more 
importantly, should—stand fast, you may begin to perceive the 
weapons at your disposal. If what you are doing is causing you to 
lash out at others impulsively; if what you are doing is destroying 
your motivation to move forward; if your actions and inactions are 
making you contemptuous of yourself and, worse, of the world; if 
the manner in which you conduct your life is making it difficult for 
you to wake happily in the morning; if you are plagued by a deep 
sense of self-betrayal—perhaps you are choosing to ignore that still 
small voice, inclined as you may be to consider it something only 
attended to by the weak and naive. 

If you are at work, and called upon to do what makes you 
contemptuous of yourself—weak and ashamed, likely to lash out at 
those you love, unwilling to perform productively, and sick of your 
life—it is possible that it is time to meditate, consider, strategize, 
and place yourself in a position where you are capable of saying no.* 
Perhaps you will garner additional respect from the people you are 
opposing on moral grounds, even though you may still pay a high 
price for your actions. Perhaps they will even come to rethink their 
stance—if not now, with time (as their own consciences might be 
plaguing them in that same still small manner). 


PRACTICALITIES 


Perhaps you should also be positioning yourself for a lateral move— 
into another job, for example, noting as you may, “This occupation 
is deadening my soul, and that is truly not for me. It is time to take 
the painstaking steps necessary to organize my CV, and to engage in 
the difficult, demanding, and often unrewarding search for a new 
job” (but you have to be successful only once). Maybe you can find 
something that pays better and is more interesting, and where you 
are working with people who not only fail to kill your spirit, but 


positively rejuvenate it. Maybe following the dictates of conscience 
is in fact the best possible plan that you have—at minimum, 
otherwise you have to live with your sense of self-betrayal and the 
knowledge that you put up with what you truly could not tolerate. 
Nothing about that is good. 

I might get fired. Well, prepare now to seek out and ready 
yourself for another job, hopefully better (or prepare yourself to go 
over your manager’s head with a well-prepared and articulate 
argument). And do not begin by presuming that leaving your job, 
even involuntarily, is necessarily for the worst. 

Iam afraid to move. Well, of course you are, but afraid compared 
to what? Afraid in comparison to continuing in a job where the 
center of your being is at stake; where you become weaker, more 
contemptible, more bitter, and more prone to pressure and tyranny 
over the years? There are few choices in life where there is no risk 
on either side, and it is often necessary to contemplate the risks of 
staying as thoroughly as the risks of moving. I have seen many 
people move, sometimes after several years of strategizing, and end 
up in better shape, psychologically and pragmatically, after their 
time in the desert. 

Perhaps no one else would want me. Well, the rejection rate for 
new job applications is extraordinarily high. I tell my clients to 
assume 50:1, so their expectations are set properly. You are going to 
be passed over, in many cases, for many positions for which you are 
qualified. But that is rarely personal. It is, instead, a condition of 
existence, an inevitable consequence of somewhat arbitrary 
subjection to the ambivalent conditions of worth characterizing 
society. It is the consequence of the fact that CVs are easy to 
disseminate and difficult to process; that many jobs have 
unannounced internal candidates (and so are just going through the 
motions); and that some companies keep a rolling stock of 
applicants, in case they need to hire quickly. That is an actuarial 
problem, a statistical problem, a baseline problem—and not 
necessarily an indication that there is something specifically flawed 
about you. You must incorporate all that sustainingly pessimistic 
realism into your expectations, so that you do not become 


unreasonably downhearted. One hundred and fifty applications, 
carefully chosen; three to five interviews thereby acquired. That 
could be a mission of a year or more. That is much less than a 
lifetime of misery and downward trajectory. But it is not nothing. 
You need to fortify yourself for it, plan, and garner support from 
people who understand what you are up to and are realistically 
appraised of the difficulty and the options. 

Now it may also be that you are lagging in the development of 
your skills and could improve your performance at work so that 
your chances of being hired elsewhere are heightened. But there is 
no loss in that. You cannot effectively pronounce “no” in the 
presence of corrupt power when your options to move are 
nonexistent. In consequence, you have a moral obligation to place 
yourself in a position of comparative strength, and to do then what 
is necessary to capitalize on that strength. You may also have to 
think through worst-case situations and to discuss them with those 
who will be affected by your decisions. But it is once again worth 
realizing that staying where you should not be may be the true 
worst-case situation: one that drags you out and kills you slowly 
over decades. That is not a good death, even though it is slow, and 
there is very little in it that does not speak of the hopelessness that 
makes people age quickly and long for the cessation of career and, 
worse, life. That is no improvement. As the old and cruel cliché 
goes: If you must cut off a cat’s tail, do not do it half an inch at a 
time. You may well be in for a few painful years of belated 
recognition of insufficiency, and required to send out four or five or 
ten job applications a week, knowing full well that the majority will 
be rejected with less than a second look. But you need to win the 
lottery only once, and a few years of difficulty with hope beat an 
entire dejected lifetime of a degenerating and oppressed career. 

And let us be clear: It is not a simple matter of hating your job 
because it requires you to wake up too early in the morning, or to 
drag yourself to work when it is too hot or cold or windy or dry or 
when you are feeling low and want to curl up in bed. It is not a 
matter of frustration generated when you are called on to do things 
that are menial or necessary such as emptying garbage cans, 


sweeping floors, cleaning bathrooms, or in any other manner taking 
your lowly but well-deserved place at the bottom of the hierarchy of 
competence—even of seniority. Resentment generated by such 
necessary work is most often merely ingratitude, inability to accept 
a lowly place at the beginning, unwillingness to adopt the position 
of the fool, or arrogance and lack of discipline. Refusal of the call of 
conscience is by no means the same thing as irritation about 
undesirably low status. 

That rejection—that betrayal of soul—is truly the requirement to 
perform demonstrably counterproductive, absurd, or pointless 
work; to treat others unjustly and to lie about it; to engage in deceit, 
to betray your future self; to put up with unnecessary torture and 
abuse (and to silently watch others suffer the same treatment). That 
rejection is the turning of a blind eye, and the agreement to say and 
do things that betray your deepest values and make you a cheat at 
your own game. And there is no doubt that the road to hell, 
personally and socially, is paved not so much with good intentions 
as with the adoption of attitudes and undertaking of actions that 
inescapably disturb your conscience. 

Do not do what you hate.

RULE VI 


ABANDON IDEOLOGY 


THE WRONG PLACES 


After I published my last book, my wife, Tammy, and I embarked on 
a lengthy speaking tour throughout the English-speaking world and 
a good part of Europe, particularly in the north. Most of the theaters 
I spoke at were old and beautiful, and it was a delight to be in 
buildings with such rich architectural and cultural histories, where 
so many of the bands we loved had played, and where other 
performing artists had had their great moments. We booked 160 
theaters—generally with a capacity of about 2,500 to 3,000 people 
(although there were smaller venues in Europe, and larger in 
Australia). I was—and am—struck to the core by the fact that there 
was such an extensive audience for my lectures—and that we found 
that audience seemingly everywhere. The same surprise extends to 
my YouTube and podcast appearances—on my own channels, in 
interviews on others, and in the innumerable clips that people have 
voluntarily cut from my longer talks and discussions with 
journalists. These have been watched or listened to hundreds of 
millions of times. And finally, there is the aforementioned book, 
which will have sold something like four million copies in English 
by the time the present volume is published, and which will be 
translated into fifty additional languages, assuming matters 
continue as they are now. It is not at all easy to know what to think 
about finding myself with an audience like that. 


What is going on? Any sensible person would be taken aback—to 
put it mildly—by all of this. It seems that my work must be 
addressing something that is missing in many people’s lives. Now, 
as I mentioned previously, I am relying for much of my content on 
the ideas of great psychologists and other thinkers, and that should 
count for something. But I have also been continually considering 
what else more specific (if anything) might be attracting people’s 
attention, and have been relying on two sources of information to 
try to determine exactly that. The first is the response I get directly 
from individuals themselves, when I meet them in the immediate 
aftermath of one of my lectures or when they stop me on the street, 
in airports, cafés, or other public places. 

In one midwestern American city (I think it might have been 
Louisville), a young man met me after my lecture and said, “Quick 
story. Two years ago, I was released from prison. Homeless. Broke. I 
started listening to your lectures. Now I have a full-time job, and I 
own my apartment, and my wife and I just had our first child—a 
daughter. Thank you.” And the “thank you” was accompanied with 
direct eye contact and a firm handshake, and the story was told in 
the voice of conviction. And people tell me very similar stories on 
the street, often in tears, although the one I just related was perhaps 
a bit more extreme than the average tale. They share very private 
good news (the kind you share only with people to whom you can 
safely tell such things). And I feel greatly privileged to be one of 
those people, although it is emotionally demanding to be the 
recipient of continual personal revelations, regardless (or maybe 
even because) of the fact that they are so positive. I find it heart- 
wrenching to see how little encouragement and guidance so many 
people have received, and how much good can emerge when just a 
little more is provided. “I knew you could do it” is a good start, and 
goes a long way toward ameliorating some of the unnecessary pain 
in the world. 

So, that is one form of story that I hear, continually, in many 
variants. When we meet, one on one, people also tell me that they 
enjoy my lectures and what I have written because what I say and 
write provides them with the words they need to express things they 


already know, but are unable to articulate. It is helpful for everyone 
to be able to represent explicitly what they already implicitly 
understand. I am frequently plagued with doubts about the role that 
I am playing, so the fact that people find my words exist in 
accordance with their deep but heretofore unrealized or 
unexpressed beliefs is reassuring, helping me maintain faith in what 
I have learned and thought about and have now shared so publicly. 
Helping people bridge the gap between what they profoundly intuit 
but cannot articulate seems to be a reasonable and valuable 
function for a public intellectual. And then there is the final piece of 
information bearing on whatever it is that I am accomplishing. I 
have garnered it as a direct consequence of the live lectures that I 
have had so many opportunities to deliver. It is a privilege and a gift 
to be able to talk repeatedly to large groups of people. It provides a 
real-time opportunity to judge the zeitgeist, the spirit of the times. 
It also allows me to formulate and immediately test new ideas for 
their communicability and their ability to grip attention and, 
thereby, to judge their quality—at least in part. This occurs during 
the talk when I attend to how the audience responds. 

In 12 Rules for Life, Rule 9: Assume that the person you are 
listening to might know something you do not, I suggest that when 
speaking to a large group you should nonetheless always be 
attending to specific individuals—the crowd is somewhat of an 
illusion. However, you can augment your individual-focused visual 
attention by simultaneously listening to the entire group, so that 
you hear them rustling around, laughing, coughing, or whatever 
they happen to be doing, while you concentrate on perceiving 
specific individuals. What you want to see from the person you are 
facing is rapt attention. What you want to hear from the crowd is 
dead silence. You want to hear nothing. Achieving that means your 
listeners are not distracted by everything they could be thinking 
about while in attendance. If you are an audience member at a 
performance, and you are not completely enthralled by the content, 
you become preoccupied by some slight physical discomforts, and 
shift from place to place. You become aware of your own thoughts. 
You begin to think about what you need to do tomorrow. You 


whisper something to the person beside you. That all adds up to 
discontent in the audience, and audible noise. But if you, as speaker, 
are positioned properly on stage, physically and spiritually, then 
everybody’s attention will be focused with laser-like intensity on 
whatever you are saying, and no one will make a sound. In this 
manner, you can tell what ideas have power. 

While watching and listening in the way I just described to all the 
gatherings I have spoken to, I became increasingly aware that the 
mention of one topic in particular brought every audience (and I 
mean that without exception) to a dead-quiet halt: responsibility— 
the very topic we made central in this book in Rule IV: Notice that 
opportunity lurks where responsibility has been abdicated. That 
response was fascinating—and not at all predictable. Responsibility 
is not an easy sell. Parents have been striving forever to make their 
kids responsible. Society attempts the same thing, with its 
educational institutions, apprenticeships, volunteer organizations, 
and clubs. You might even consider the inculcation of responsibility 
the fundamental purpose of society. But something has gone wrong. 
We have committed an error, or a series of errors. We have spent 
too much time, for example (much of the last fifty years), clamoring 
about rights, and we are no longer asking enough of the young 
people we are socializing. We have been telling them for decades to 
demand what they are owed by society. We have been implying that 
the important meanings of their lives will be given to them because 
of such demands, when we should have been doing the opposite: 
letting them know that the meaning that sustains life in all its 
tragedy and disappointment is to be found in shouldering a noble 
burden. Because we have not been doing this, they have grown up 
looking in the wrong places. And this has left them vulnerable: 
vulnerable to easy answers and susceptible to the deadening force of 
resentment. What about the unfolding of history has left us in this 
position? How has this vulnerability, this susceptibility, come 
about? 


PERHAPS HE IS ONLY SLEEPING 


In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the German 
philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche famously announced “God is dead.” 
This utterance has become so famous that you can even see it 
scribbled on the walls of public bathrooms, where it often takes the 
following form: “God is dead” —Nietzsche. “Nietzsche is dead” — 
God. Nietzsche did not make this claim in a narcissistic or 
triumphant manner. The great thinker’s opinion stemmed from his 
fear that all the Judeo-Christian values serving as the foundation of 
Western civilization had been made dangerously subject to casual 
rational criticism, and that the most important axiom upon which 
they were predicated—the existence of a transcendent, all-powerful 
deity—had been fatally challenged. Nietzsche concluded from this 
that everything would soon fall apart, in a manner catastrophic both 
psychologically and socially. 

It does not require a particularly careful reader to note that 
Nietzsche described God, in The Gay Science, as the “holiest and 
mightiest of all that the world has yet owned,” and modern human 
beings as “the murderers of all murderers.”* These are not the sorts 
of descriptions you might expect from a triumphant rationalist 
celebrating the demise of superstition. It was instead a statement of 
absolute despair. In his other works, particularly in The Will to 
Power, Nietzsche describes what would occur in the next century 
and beyond because of this murderous act.* He prophesied (and 
that is the correct word for it) that two major consequences would 
arise—apparent opposites, although each linked inextricably and 
causally together—and both associated with the death of traditional 
ritual, story, and belief. 

As the purpose of human life became uncertain outside the 
purposeful structure of monotheistic thought and the meaningful 
world it proposed, we would experience an existentially devastating 
rise in nihilism, Nietzsche believed. Alternatively, he suggested, 
people would turn to identification with rigid, totalitarian ideology: 
the substitute of human ideas for the transcendent Father of All 
Creation. The doubt that undermines and the certainty that crushes: 


Nietzsche’s prognostication for the two alternatives that would arise 
in the aftermath of the death of God. 

The incomparable Russian novelist Fyodor Dostoyevsky 
addressed the same question as Nietzsche—at about the same time 
—in his masterwork The Possessed (alternatively known as Demons 
or The Devils).*: The protagonist in that novel, Nikolai Stavrogin, is 
wed to the same ideals that eventually birthed revolutionary 
communism, although he lives his fictional life decades before the 
full-fledged turmoil began in what became the Soviet Union. The 
appearance of these ideals was not a positive development, in 
Dostoevsky’s view. He could see that the adoption of a rigid, 
comprehensive utopian ideology, predicated on a few apparently 
self-evident axioms, presented a political and spiritual danger with 
the potential to far exceed in brutality all that had occurred in the 
religious, monarchical, or even pagan past. Dostoyevsky, like 
Nietzsche, foresaw that all of this was coming almost fifty years (!) 
before the Leninist Revolution in Russia. That incomprehensible 
level of prophetic capacity remains a stellar example of how the 
artist and his intuition brings to light the future far before others 
see it. 

Nietzsche and Dostoevsky both foresaw that communism would 
appear dreadfully attractive—an apparently rational, coherent, and 
moral alternative to religion or nihilism—and that the consequences 
would be lethal. The former wrote, in his inimitably harsh, ironic, 
and brilliant manner, “In fact, I even wish a few experiments might 
be made to show that in socialistic society life denies itself, and 
itself cuts away its own roots. The earth is big enough and man is 
still unexhausted enough for a practical lesson of this sort and 
demonstratio ad absurdum—even if it were accomplished only by a 
vast expenditure of lives—to seem worthwhile to me.”* The 
socialism Nietzsche referred to was not the relatively mild version 
later popular in Britain, Scandinavia, and Canada, with its 
sometimes genuine emphasis on the improvement of working-class 
life, but the full-blown collectivism of Russia, China, and a host of 
smaller countries. Whether we have truly learned the “practical 
lesson”—the demonstration of the absurdity of the doctrine—as a 


consequence of Nietzsche’s predicted “vast expenditure of lives” 
remains to be seen. 

Nietzsche appears to have unquestioningly adopted the idea that 
the world was both objective and valueless in the manner posited by 
the emergent physical sciences. This left him with a single 
remaining escape from nihilism and totalitarianism: the emergence 
of the individual strong enough to create his own values, project 
them onto valueless reality, and then abide by them. He posited that 
a new kind of man—the Ubermensch (the higher person or 
superman)—would be necessary in the aftermath of the death of 
God, so that society would not drift toward the opposing rocky 
shoals of despair and oversystematized political theorizing. 
Individuals who take this route, this alternative to nihilism and 
totalitarianism, must therefore produce their own cosmology of 
values. 

However, the psychoanalysts Freud and Jung put paid to that 
notion, demonstrating that we are not sufficiently in possession of 
ourselves to create values by conscious choice. Furthermore, there 
is little evidence that any of us have the genius to create ourselves 
ex nihilo—from nothing—particularly given the extreme limitations 
of our experience, the biases of our perceptions, and the short span 
of our lives. We have a nature—or, too often, it has us—and only a 
fool would now dare to claim that we have sufficient mastery of 
ourselves to create, rather than discover, what we value. We have 
the capacity for spontaneous revelatory experience—artistic, 
inventive, and religious. We discover new things about ourselves 
constantly, to our delight—and also to our dismay, as we are so 
often overcome by our emotions and motivations. We contend with 
our nature. We negotiate with it. But it is not at all obvious that the 
individual will ever be capable of bringing the new values that 
Nietzsche so fervently longed for into being. 

There are other problems with Nietzsche’s argument, as well. If 
each of us lives by our own created and projected values, what 
remains to unite us? This is a philosophical problem of central 
importance. How could a society of Ubermenschen possibly avoid 
being at constant odds with one another, unless there was 


something comparable about their created values? Finally, it is by 
no means obvious that any such supermen have ever come into 
existence. Instead, over the last century and a half, with the modern 
crisis of meaning and the rise of totalitarian states such as Nazi 
Germany, the USSR, and Communist China, we appear to have 
found ourselves in exactly the nihilistic or ideologically possessed 
state that Nietzsche and Dostoevsky feared, accompanied by 
precisely the catastrophic sociological and psychological 
consequences they foretold. 

It is also by no means self-evident that value, subjective though it 
appears to be, is not an integral part of reality, despite the 
undeniable utility of the scientific method. The central scientific 
axiom left to us by the Enlightenment—that reality is the exclusive 
domain of the objective—poses a fatal challenge to the reality of 
religious experience, if the latter experience is fundamentally 
subjective (and it appears to be exactly that). But there is something 
complicating the situation that seems to lie between the subjective 
and the objective: What if there are experiences that typically 
manifest themselves to one person at a time (as seems to be the 
case with much of revelation), but appear to form a meaningful 
pattern when considered collectively? That indicates something is 
occurring that is not merely subjective, even though it cannot be 
easily pinned down with the existing methods of science. It could 
be, instead, that the value of something is sufficiently idiosyncratic 
—sufficiently dependent on the particularities of time, place, and 
the individual experiencing that thing—that it cannot be fixed and 
replicated in the manner required for it to exist as a scientific object. 
This does not mean, however, that value is not real: It means only 
that it is so complex that it cannot yet and may never fit itself within 
the scientific worldview. The world is a very strange place, and there 
are times when the metaphorical or narrative description 
characteristic of culture and the material representation so integral 
to science appear to touch, when everything comes together—when 
life and art reflect each other equally. 

The psyche—the soul—that produces or is the recipient of such 
experiences appears incontrovertibly real: the proof lying not least 


in our actions. We all axiomatically assume the reality of our 
individual existences and conscious experiences, and we extend the 
same courtesy to others (or else). It is by no means unreasonable to 
suggest that such existence and experience has a deep underlying 
biological and physical structure. Those with a psychoanalytic bent 
certainly assume so, as do many who study biological psychology, 
particularly if they focus on motivation and emotion.°* That 
structure, accepted as a given by scientists and by the general 
population in equal measure, appears to manifest religious 
experience as part of its basic function—and that religious function 
has enough commonality across people to make us at least 
understand what “religious experience” means—particularly if we 
have had a taste of it at some point in life. 

What does that imply? It might be that the true meaning of life is 
available for discovery, if it can be discovered at all, by each 
individual, alone—although in communication with others, past and 
present. It may well be, therefore, that the true meaning of life is 
not to be found in what is objective, but in what is subjective (but 
still universal). The existence of conscience, for example, provides 
some evidence for that, as does the fact that religious experiences 
can reliably be induced chemically, as well as through practices such 
as dancing, chanting, fasting, and meditating. Additionally, the fact 
that religious ideas are capable of uniting vast numbers of people 
under a single moral umbrella (although such ideas can divide 
across sects, as well) also indicates something universal calling 
from within. Why do we so easily assume that nothing about that is 
real, given its apparent commonality and necessity—given, as well, 
the near certainty that the capacity for valuing is an ancient evolved 
function, selected for by the very reality we are attempting to define 
and understand? 

We have seen the consequences of the totalitarian alternatives in 
which the collective is supposed to bear the burdens of life, lay out 
the proper pathway, and transform the terrible world into the 
promised utopia. The communists produced a worldview that was 
attractive to fair-minded people, as well as those who were envious 
and cruel. Perhaps communism may even have been a viable 


solution to the problems of the unequal distribution of wealth that 
characterized the industrial age, if all of the hypothetically 
oppressed were good people and all of the evil was to be found, as 
hypothesized, in their bourgeoisie overlords. Unfortunately for the 
communists, a substantial proportion of the oppressed were 
incapable, unconscientious, unintelligent, licentious, power mad, 
violent, resentful, and jealous, while a substantial proportion of the 
oppressors were educated, able, creative, intelligent, honest, and 
caring. When the frenzy of dekulakization swept through the newly 
established Soviet Union, it was vengeful and jealous murderers 
who were redistributing property, while it was competent and 
reliable farmers, for the most part, from whom it was violently 
taken. One unintended consequence of that “redistribution” of good 
fortune was the starvation of six million Ukrainians in the 1930s, in 
the midst of some of the most fertile land in the world. 

The other major villains of the twentieth century, Germany’s 
National Socialists, were, of course, also powerful and dangerous 
ideologues. It has been suggested that Hitler’s acolytes were 
inspired by Nietzsche’s philosophy. This claim may hold some truth 
in a perverse manner, as they were certainly trying to create their 
own values, although not as the individuals whose development the 
philosopher promoted. It is more reasonable to say that Nietzsche 
identified the cultural and historical conditions that made the rise 
to influence of ideas akin to those promoted by the Nazis extremely 
likely. The Nazis were trying to create a post-Christian, postreligious 
perfect man, the ideal Aryan, and certainly formulated that ideal in a 
manner not in accordance with the dictates of either Judaism or 
Christianity. Thus, the perfect Aryan could be and certainly was 
conceptualized by the Nazis as a “higher man.” This does not mean 
that the Nazi ideal as postulated bore any resemblance to the 
Nietzschean ideal. Quite the contrary: Nietzsche was a fervent 
admirer of individuality and would have considered the idea of the 
higher man as state creation both absurd and abhorrent. 


THE FATAL ATTRACTION OF THE FALSE IDOL 


Consider those who have not gone so far as to adopt the discredited 
ideologies of the Marxist-Leninists and the Nazis, but who still 
maintain faith in the commonplace isms characterizing the modern 
world: conservatism, socialism, feminism (and all manner of ethnic- 
and gender-study isms), postmodernism, and environmentalism, 
among others. They are all monotheists, practically speaking—or 
polytheistic worshippers of a very small number of gods. These gods 
are the axioms and foundational beliefs that must be accepted, a 
priori, rather than proven, before the belief system can be adopted, 
and when accepted and applied to the world allow the illusion to 
prevail that knowledge has been produced. 

The process by which an ism system can be generated is simple in 
its initial stages but baroque enough in its application to mimic (and 
replace) actual productive theorizing. The ideologue begins by 
selecting a few abstractions in whose low-resolution 
representations hide large, undifferentiated chunks of the world. 
Some examples include “the economy,” “the nation,” “the 
environment,” “the patriarchy,” “the people,” “the rich,” “the poor,” 
“the oppressed,” and “the oppressors.” The use of single terms 
implicitly hypersimplifies what are in fact extraordinarily diverse 
and complex phenomena (that masked complexity is part of the 
reason that the terms come to carry so much emotional weight). 
There are many reasons, for example, why people are poor. Lack of 
money is the obvious cause—but that hypothetical obviousness is 
part of the problem with ideology. Lack of education, broken 
families, crime-ridden neighborhoods, alcoholism, drug abuse, 
criminality and corruption (and the political and economic 
exploitation that accompanies it), mental illness, lack of a life plan 
(or even failure to realize that formulating such a plan is possible or 
necessary), low conscientiousness, unfortunate geographical locale, 
shift in the economic landscape and the consequent disappearance 
of entire fields of endeavor, the marked proclivity for those who are 
rich to get richer still and the poor to get poorer, low 
creativity/entrepreneurial interest, lack of encouragement—these 


are but a few of the manifold problems that generate poverty, and 
the solution to each (assuming that a solution exists) is by no 
means obviously the same. Nor are the villains hiding behind each 
putative and differentiable cause the same villains (assuming that 
there are even villains to be found). 

All such problems require careful, particularized analysis, 
followed by the generation of multiple potential solutions, followed 
by the careful assessment of those solutions to ensure that they are 
having their desired effect. It is uncommon to see any serious social 
problem addressed so methodically. It is also rare that the solutions 
generated, even by methodical process, produce the intended 
outcome. The great difficulty of assessing problems in sufficient 
detail to understand what is causing them, followed by the equally 
great difficulty of generating and testing particularized solutions, is 
sufficient to deter even the stouthearted, let us say, from daring to 
tackle a true plague of mankind. Since the ideologue can place him 
or herself on the morally correct side of the equation without the 
genuine effort necessary to do so validly, it is much easier and more 
immediately gratifying to reduce the problem to something simple 
and accompany it with an evildoer, who can then be morally 
opposed. 

After breaking the world into large, undifferentiated pieces, 
describing the problem(s) that characterize each division, and 
identifying the appropriate villains, the ism theorist then generates 
a small number of explanatory principles or forces (which may 
indeed contribute in some part to the understanding or existence of 
those abstracted entities). Then he or she grants to that small 
number primary causal power, while ignoring others of equal or 
greater importance. It is most effective to utilize a major 
motivational system or large-scale sociological fact or conjecture for 
such purposes. It is also good to select those explanatory principles 
for an unstated negative, resentful, and destructive reason, and then 
make discussion of the latter and the reason for their existence 
taboo for the ideologue and his or her followers (to say nothing of 
the critics). Next, the faux theorist spins a post-hoc theory about 
how every phenomenon, no matter how complex, can be considered 


a secondary consequence of the new, totalizing system. Finally, a 
school of thought emerges to propagate the methods of this 
algorithmic reduction (particularly when the thinker is hoping to 
attain dominance in the conceptual and the real worlds), and those 
who refuse to adopt the algorithm or who criticize its use are tacitly 
or explicitly demonized. 

Incompetent and corrupt intellectuals thrive on such activity, 
such games. The first players of a given game of this sort are 
generally the brightest of the participants. They weave a story 
around their causal principle of choice, demonstrating how that 
hypothetically primary motivational force profoundly contributed to 
any given domain of human activity. Sometimes this is even helpful, 
as such activity may shed light on how a motivation heretofore 
taboo to discuss or consider might play a larger role in affecting 
human behavior and perception than was previously deemed 
acceptable (this is what happened, for example, with Freud, and his 
emphasis on sex). Their followers, desperate to join a potentially 
masterable new dominance hierarchy (the old one being cluttered 
by its current occupants), become enamored of that story. While 
doing so, being less bright than those they follow, they subtly shift 
“contributed to” or “affected” to “caused.” The originator(s), 
gratified by the emergence of followers, start to shift their story in 
that direction as well. Or they object, but it does not matter. The cult 
has already begun. 

This kind of theorizing is particularly attractive to people who are 
smart but lazy. Cynicism serves as an aid, too, as does arrogance. 
The new adherents will be taught that mastering such a game 
constitutes education, and will learn to criticize alternative theories, 
different methods, and increasingly, even the idea of fact itself. If an 
impenetrable vocabulary accompanies the theory, so much the 
better. It will then take potential critics some valuable time even to 
learn to decode the arguments. And there is a conspiratorial aspect 
that rapidly comes to pervade the school where such “education” 
occurs, and where such activity is increasingly all that is permitted: 
Do not criticize the theory—and do not get singled out. Do not 
become unpopular. Even: Do not receive a bad grade, or a poor 


review, for expressing a taboo opinion (and even when this does not 
occur in practice, the fear that it might keeps many students and 
professors, or employees and employers, in check). 

Freud, as we noted, attempted to reduce motivation to sexuality, 
to libido. The same can be done quite effectively by anyone 
sufficiently literate, intelligent, and verbally fluent. This is because 
“sexuality” (like any multifaceted single term) can be defined as 
tightly or as loosely as necessary by those who use it for 
comprehensively explanatory purposes. No matter how defined, sex 
is a crucially important biological phenomenon—key to complex life 
itself—and its influence may therefore be genuinely detected or 
plausibly invented in any important field of endeavor and then 
exaggerated (while other factors of significant import are 
diminished in importance). In this manner, the single explanatory 
principle can be expanded indefinitely, in keeping with the demands 
placed upon it. 

Marx did the same thing when he described man in a 
fundamentally economic, class-based manner, and history as the 
eternal battleground of bourgeoisie and proletariat. Everything can 
be explained by running it through a Marxist algorithm. The 
wealthy are wealthy because they exploit the poor. The poor are 
poor because they are exploited by the wealthy. All economic 
inequality is undesirable, unproductive, and a consequence of 
fundamental unfairness and corruption. There is, of course—as in 
the case of Freud—some value in Marx’s observations. Class is an 
important element of social hierarchies, and tends to maintain itself 
with a certain stability across time. Economic well-being, or the lack 
thereof, is of crucial significance. And the damnable fact of the 
Pareto distribution°—the tendency of those who have more to get 
more (which seems to apply in any economic system)—does mean 
that wealth accumulates in the hands of a minority of people. The 
people who make up that minority do change substantively, 
regardless of the aforementioned class stability, and that is a 
crucial point, but the fact that the comparatively rich are always a 
minority—and a small one, at that—seems dismally immutable. 


Regardless of its hypothetical virtues, however, the 
implementation of Marxism was a disaster everywhere it was 
attempted—and that has motivated attempts by its unrepentant 
would-be present-day adherents to clothe its ideas in new garb and 
continue forward, as if nothing of significance has changed. 
Thinkers powerfully influenced by Marx and overwhelmingly 
influential in much of the academy today (such as Michel Foucault 
and Jacques Derrida) modified the Marxist simplification 
essentially by replacing “economics” with “power”—as if power were 
the single motivating force behind all human behavior (as opposed, 
say, to competent authority, or reciprocity of attitude and action). 

Ideological reduction of that form is the hallmark of the most 
dangerous of pseudo-intellectuals. Ideologues are the intellectual 
equivalent of fundamentalists, unyielding and rigid. Their self- 
righteousness and moral claim to social engineering is every bit as 
deep and dangerous. It might even be worse: ideologues lay claim to 
rationality itself. So, they try to justify their claims as logical and 
thoughtful. At least the fundamentalists admit devotion to 
something they just believe arbitrarily. They are a lot more honest. 
Furthermore, fundamentalists are bound by a relationship with the 
transcendent. What this means is that God, the center of their 
moral universe, remains outside and above complete 
understanding, according to the fundamentalist’s own creed. Right- 
wing Jews, Islamic hard-liners, and ultra-conservative Christians 
must admit, if pushed, that God is essentially mysterious. This 
concession provides at least some boundary for their claims, as 
individuals, to righteousness and power (as the genuine 
fundamentalist at least remains subordinate to Something he 
cannot claim to totally understand, let alone master). For the 
ideologue, however, nothing remains outside understanding or 
mastery. An ideological theory explains everything: all the past, all 
the present, and all the future. This means that an ideologue can 
consider him or herself in possession of the complete truth 
(something forbidden to the self-consistent fundamentalist). There 
is no claim more totalitarian and no situation in which the worst 
excesses of pride are more likely to manifest themselves (and not 


only pride, but then deceit, once the ideology has failed to explain 
the world or predict its future). 

The moral of the story? Beware of intellectuals who make a 
monotheism out of their theories of motivation. Beware, in more 
technical terms, of blanket univariate (single variable) causes for 
diverse, complex problems. Of course, power plays a role in history, 
as does economics. But the same can be said of jealousy, love, 
hunger, sex, cooperation, revelation, anger, disgust, sadness, 
anxiety, religion, compassion, disease, technology, hatred, and 
chance—none of which can definitively be reduced to another. The 
attraction of doing so is, however, obvious: simplicity, ease, and the 
illusion of mastery (which can have exceptionally useful 
psychological and social consequences, particularly in the short 
term)—and, let us not forget, the frequent discovery of a villain, or 
set of villains, upon which the hidden motivations for the ideology 
can be vented. 


RESSENTIMENT 


Ressentiment®—hostile resentment—occurs when individual failure 
or insufficient status is blamed both on the system within which 
that failure or lowly status occurs and then, most particularly, on 
the people who have achieved success and high status within that 
system. The former, the system, is deemed by fiat to be unjust. The 
successful are deemed exploitative and corrupt, as they can be 
logically read as undeserving beneficiaries, as well as the voluntary, 
conscious, self-serving, and immoral supporters, if the system is 
unjust. Once this causal chain of thought has been accepted, all 
attacks on the successful can be construed as morally justified 
attempts at establishing justice—rather than, say, manifestations of 
envy and covetousness that might have traditionally been defined as 
shameful. 

There is another typical feature of ideological pursuit: the victims 
supported by ideologues are always innocent (and it is sometimes 
true that victims are innocent), and the perpetrators are always evil 


(evil perpetrators are also not in short supply). But the fact that 
there exist genuine victims and perpetrators provides no excuse to 
make low-resolution, blanket statements about the global locale of 
blameless victimization and evil perpetration—particularly of the 
type that does not take the presumed innocence of the accused 
firmly into account. No group guilt should be assumed—and 
certainly not of the multigenerational kind.° It is a certain sign of 
the accuser’s evil intent, and a harbinger of social catastrophe. But 
the advantage is that the ideologue, at little practical costs, can 
construe him or herself both as nemesis of the oppressor and 
defender of the oppressed. Who needs the fine distinctions that 
determination of individual guilt or innocence demands when a 
prize such as that beckons? 

To take the path of ressentiment is to risk tremendous bitterness. 
This is in no small part a consequence of identifying the enemy 
without rather than within. If wealth is the problem at issue, for 
example, and the wealthy perceived as the reason for poverty and all 
the other problems of the world, then the wealthy become the 
enemy—indistinguishable, in some profound sense, from a degree 
of evil positively demonic in its psychological and social 
significance. If power is the problem, then those who have 
established any authority at all are the singular cause of the world’s 
suffering. If masculinity is the problem, then all males (or even the 
concept of male) must be attacked and vilified.* Such division of the 
world into the devil without and the saint within justifies self- 
righteous hatred—necessitated by the morality of the ideological 
system itself. This is a terrible trap: Once the source of evil has been 
identified, it becomes the duty of the righteous to eradicate it. This 
is an invitation to both paranoia and persecution. A world where 
only you and people who think like you are good is also a world 
where you are surrounded by enemies bent on your destruction, 
who must be fought. 

It is much safer morally to look to yourself for the errors of the 
world, at least to the degree to which someone honest and free of 
willful blindness might consider. You are likely to be much more 
clear minded about what is what and who is who and where blame 


lies once you contemplate the log in your own eye, rather than the 
speck in your brother’s. It is probable that your own imperfections 
are evident and plentiful, and could profitably be addressed, as step 
one in your Redeemer’s quest to improve the world. To take the 
world’s sins onto yourself—to assume responsibility for the fact that 
things have not been set right in your own life and elsewhere—is 
part of the messianic path: part of the imitation of the hero, in the 
most profound of senses. This is a psychological or spiritual rather 
than a sociological or political issue. Consider the characters 
fabricated by second-rate crafters of fiction: they are simply divided 
into those who are good and those who are evil. By contrast, 
sophisticated writers put the divide inside the characters they 
create, so that each person becomes the locus of the eternal struggle 
between light and darkness. It is much more psychologically 
appropriate (and much less dangerous socially) to assume that you 
are the enemy—that it is your weaknesses and insufficiencies that 
are damaging the world—than to assume saintlike goodness on the 
part of you and your party, and to pursue the enemy you will then 
be inclined to see everywhere. 

It is impossible to fight patriarchy, reduce oppression, promote 
equality, transform capitalism, save the environment, eliminate 
competitiveness, reduce government, or to run every organization 
like a business. Such concepts are simply too low-resolution. The 
Monty Python comedy crew once offered satirical lessons for 
playing the flute: blow over one end and move your fingers up and 
down on the holes.*° True. But useless. The necessary detail is 
simply not there. Similarly, sophisticated large-scale processes and 
systems do not exist in a manner sufficiently real to render their 
comprehensive unitary transformation possible. The idea that they 
do is the product of twentieth-century cults. The beliefs of these 
cults are simultaneously naive and narcissistic, and the activism 
they promote is the resentful and lazy person’s substitute for actual 
accomplishment. The single axioms of the ideologically possessed 
are gods, served blindly by their proselytizers. 

Like God, however, ideology is dead. The bloody excesses of the 
twentieth century killed it. We should let it go, and begin to address 


and consider smaller, more precisely defined problems. We should 
conceptualize them at the scale at which we might begin to solve 
them, not by blaming others, but by trying to address them 
personally while simultaneously taking responsibility for the 
outcome. 

Have some humility. Clean up your bedroom. Take care of your 
family. Follow your conscience. Straighten up your life. Find 
something productive and interesting to do and commit to it. When 
you can do all that, find a bigger problem and try to solve that if you 
dare. If that works, too, move on to even more ambitious projects. 
And, as the necessary beginning to that process ... abandon 
ideology.

RULE VII 


WORK AS HARD AS YOU POSSIBLY CAN ON AT 
LEAST ONE THING AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS 


THE VALUE OF HEAT AND PRESSURE 


When coal is subjected to intense heat and pressure, far below the 
Earth’s surface, its atoms rearrange themselves into the perfect 
repeating crystalline alignment characterizing a diamond. The 
carbon that makes up coal also becomes maximally durable in its 
diamond form (as diamond is the hardest of all substances). Finally, 
it becomes capable of reflecting light. This combination of durability 
and glitter gives a diamond the qualities that justify its use as a 
symbol of value. That which is valuable is pure, properly aligned, 
and glitters with light—and this is true for the person just as it is for 
the gem. Light, of course, signifies the shining brilliance of 
heightened and focused consciousness. Human beings are 
conscious during the day, when it is light. Much of that 
consciousness is visual and therefore dependent on light. To be 
illumined or enlightened is to be exceptionally awake and aware—to 
attain a state of being commonly associated with divinity. To wear a 
diamond is to become associated with the radiance of the Sun, like 
the king or queen whose profile is stamped on the sunlike disc of 
the gold coin, a near-universal standard of worth. 

Heat and pressure transform the base matter of common coal 
into the crystalline perfection and rare value of the diamond. The 
same can be said of a person. We know that the multiple forces 
operating in the human soul are often not aligned with one another. 


We do the things we wish we would not do and do not do the things 
we know we should do. We want to be thin, but we sit on the couch 
eating Cheetos and despairing. We are directionless, confused, and 
paralyzed by indecision. We are pulled in all directions by 
temptations, despite our stated will, and we waste time, 
procrastinate, and feel terrible about it, but we do not change. 

It was for such reasons that archaic people found it easy to 
believe that the human soul was haunted by ghosts—possessed by 
ancestral spirits, demons, and gods—none of whom necessarily had 
the best interests of the person at heart. Since the time of the 
psychoanalysts, these contrary forces, these obsessive and 
sometimes malevolent spirits, have been conceptualized 
psychologically as impulses, emotions, or motivational states—or as 
complexes, which act like partial personalities united within the 
person by memory but not by intent. Our neurological structure is 
indeed hierarchical. The powerful instinctual servants at the 
bottom, governing thirst, hunger, rage, sadness, elation, and lust, 
can easily ascend and become our masters, and just as easily wage 
war with one another. The resilience and strength of a united spirit 
is not easy to attain. 

A house divided against itself, proverbially, cannot stand. 
Likewise, a poorly integrated person cannot hold himself together 
when challenged. He loses union at the highest level of 
psychological organization. He loses the properly balanced 
admixture of properties that is another feature of the well-tempered 
soul, and cannot hold his self together. We know this when we say 
“He lost it” or “He just fell apart.” Before he picks up the pieces and 
rearranges them, such a person is likely to fall prey to domination 
by one or more partial personalities. This might be a spirit of rage, 
or anxiety, or pain, leaping in to occupy the person when his temper 
is lost. You can see this occurring most clearly in the case of a two- 
year-old having a tantrum. He has lost himself temporarily, and is 
for the moment pure emotion. This is an occurrence that is often 
deeply upsetting to the two-year-old himself, and one of an intensity 
that would be terrifying to beholders if manifested by an adult. The 
archaic motivational systems governing anger merely push the 


toddler’s developing personality aside, and have their way with his 
mind and actions. This is a true and unfortunate defeat for the still- 
fragile centralizing ego, struggling against powerful forces toward 
psychological and social integration. 

Lack of internal union also makes itself known in the increased 
suffering, magnification of anxiety, absence of motivation, and lack 
of pleasure that accompany indecision and uncertainty. The 
inability to decide among ten things, even when they are desirable, 
is equivalent to torment by all of them. Without clear, well-defined, 
and noncontradictory goals, the sense of positive engagement that 
makes life worthwhile is very difficult to obtain. Clear goals limit 
and simplify the world, as well, reducing uncertainty, anxiety, 
shame, and the self-devouring physiological forces unleashed by 
stress. The poorly integrated person is thus volatile and 
directionless—and this is only the beginning. Sufficient volatility 
and lack of direction can rapidly conspire to produce the 
helplessness and depression characteristic of prolonged futility. 
This is not merely a psychological state. The physical consequences 
of depression, often preceded by excess secretion of the stress 
hormone cortisol, are essentially indistinguishable from rapid aging 
(weight gain, cardiovascular problems, diabetes, cancer, and 
Alzheimer’s).* 

The social consequences are just as serious as the biological. A 
person who is not well put together overreacts to the slightest hint 
of frustration or failure. He cannot enter into productive 
negotiations, even with himself, because he cannot tolerate the 
uncertainty of discussing potential alternative futures. He cannot be 
pleased, because he cannot get what he wants, and he cannot get 
what he wants because he will not choose one thing instead of 
another. He can also be brought to a halt by the weakest of 
arguments. One of his multiple, warring subpersonalities will latch 
on to such arguments, often contrary to his best interest, and use 
them, in the form of doubts, to buttress its contrarian position. A 
deeply conflicted person can therefore be stopped, metaphorically, 
with the pressure of a single finger exerted on his chest (even 
though he may lash out against such an obstacle). To move forward 


with resolve, it is necessary to be organized—to be directed toward 
something singular and identifiable. 

Aim. Point. All this is part of maturation and discipline, and 
something to be properly valued. If you aim at nothing, you become 
plagued by everything. If you aim at nothing, you have nowhere to 
go, nothing to do, and nothing of high value in your life, as value 
requires the ranking of options and sacrifice of the lower to the 
higher. Do you really want to be anything you could be? Is that not 
too much? Might it not be better to be something specific (and then, 
perhaps, to add to that)? Would that not come as a relief—even 
though it is also a sacrifice? 


THE WORST DECISION OF ALL 


When I was in graduate school at McGill University in Montreal 
studying for my clinical PhD, I noticed a pronounced improvement 
in character in everyone who continued in the progressively more 
difficult five- to six-year program. Their social skills improved. They 
became more articulate. They found a profound sense of personal 
purpose. They served a useful function in relation to others. They 
became more disciplined and organized. They had more fun. This 
was all despite the facts that the graduate courses were often of 
lower quality than they might have been, the clinical placements 
unpaid and difficult to come by, and the relationships with graduate 
supervisors sometimes (but by no means always) subpar. Those 
beginning graduate work were often still immature and confused. 
But the discipline imposed upon them by the necessity of research— 
and more particularly, thesis preparation—soon improved their 
characters. To write something long, sophisticated, and coherent 
means, at least in part, to become more complex, articulate, and 
deeper in personality. 

When I became a professor and started mentoring undergraduate 
and graduate students, I observed the same thing. The undergrad 
psychology students who allied themselves with a lab (and therefore 
took on additional work) obtained better grades than those who 


burdened themselves less. Taking on the functions of junior 
researchers helped them establish a place and a community, while 
requiring them to discipline themselves, not least by necessitating 
more efficient use of their time. I observed a similar process when 
working as a clinical psychologist. I typically encouraged my clients 
to choose the best path currently available to them, even if it was far 
from their ideal. This sometimes meant tolerating at least a 
temporary decrease in ambition, or in pride, but had the advantage 
of substituting something real for something available only in 
fantasy. Improvements in mental health almost invariably followed. 

Is there anything worth committing to? I am now old enough to 
have seen what happens when the various manners in which this 
question might be answered manifest themselves. In my career as 
undergraduate, graduate student, professor, clinical psychologist, 
researcher, and in my various additional forays, I have seen the 
same twin paths of development manifest themselves repeatedly. 
Both are available, in principle, to everyone—to each of the half- 
developed, wandering, prematurely cynical, questioning, doubtful, 
and hopeful fools that we all are to varying degrees when young and 
on the brink of adulthood. It has become self-evident to me that 
many commitments have enduring value: those of character, love, 
family, friendship, and career foremost among them (and perhaps 
in that order). Those who remain unable or unwilling to establish a 
well-tended garden, so to speak, in any or all those domains 
inevitably suffer because of it. However, commitment requires its 
pound of flesh. To pursue an undergraduate degree means sacrifice 
and study, and the choice of a given discipline means forgoing the 
possibility of other pathways of study. The same goes for selecting a 
partner or group of friends. Cynicism about such things, or mere 
indecision or doubt, finds an easy but truly adversarial ally in the 
mindlessly nihilistic rationality that undermines everything: Why 
bother? What difference is it going to make in a thousand years? 
What makes one pathway preferable to another—or to none— 
anyway? 

It is possible to be content, or even happy, with one partner or 
another, or with one group of friends or another, or with one career 


or another. In some sense, the satisfaction that these arrangements 
bring could have been generated by different choices. They are also 
each deeply flawed: romantic partners can be fickle and complex, as 
can friends, and every career or job is characterized by frustration, 
disappointment, corruption, arbitrary hierarchy, internal politics, 
and sheer idiocy of decision making. We could conclude from that 
lack of specific or ideal value that nothing matters more than 
anything else—or to draw the even more hopeless allied conclusion 
that nothing therefore matters at all. But those who draw such 
conclusions, no matter how well armed they are with rationally 
coherent arguments, pay a high price. People suffer for it if they quit 
before completing an undergraduate degree or the study of a trade. 
And this means “quit,” not fail, although the two can be difficult to 
distinguish. Sometimes people fail because they just cannot manage 
the job, despite good intentions and necessary discipline. It takes a 
certain verbal capacity to operate effectively as a lawyer, and a 
certain degree of facility with mechanical objects, for example, to 
become a carpenter. Sometimes the match between person and 
choice is so poor that even commitment will not suffice to bring 
about the desired end. But very often failure is a consequence of 
insufficient single-mindedness, elaborate but pointless 
rationalization, and rejection of responsibility. And little good 
comes of that. 

People who do not choose a job or a career commonly become 
unmoored and drift. They may attempt to justify that drifting with a 
facade of romantic rebelliousness or prematurely world-weary 
cynicism. They may turn to casual identification with avant-garde 
artistic exploration or treat the attendant despair and aimlessness 
with the pursuit of hard-core alcohol and drug use and their instant 
gratifications. But none of that makes for a successful thirty-year- 
old (let alone someone a decade older). The same holds true for 
people who cannot choose and then commit to a single romantic 
partner, or are unable or unwilling to be loyal to their friends. They 
become lonely, isolated, and miserable, and all that merely adds the 
additional depth of bitterness to the cynicism that spurred the 


isolation in the first place. That is not the sort of vicious circle that 
you want to characterize your life. 

The people I knew who finished their undergraduate degrees or 
trade programs were better for it. Not “good,” necessarily. Not 
functioning optimally. Not necessarily thrilled with their choices, or 
devoid of doubt and misgiving. Not even certain to continue in 
pursuit of what they had studied. But far better than those who 
withdrew and drifted. The commitments and the sacrifices thereby 
entailed matured those who endured and made them better people. 
So, what is the conclusion? There are many things to which we 
might commit ourselves. A case can be made for the arbitrary and 
even meaningless nature of any given commitment, given the 
plethora of alternatives, given the corruption of the systems 
demanding that commitment. But the same case cannot be made for 
the fact of commitment itself: Those who do not choose a direction 
are lost. It is far better to become something than to remain 
anything but become nothing. This is despite all the genuine 
limitations and disappointments that becoming something entails. 
Everywhere, the cynic despairs, are bad decisions. But someone who 
has transcended that cynicism (or more accurately, replaced it with 
an even more profound doubt—that is, the doubt that doubt itself is 
an ultimately reliable guide) objects: the worst decision of all is 
none. 


DISCIPLINE AND UNITY 


The discipline that enables concentration on one thing begins 
young. At a very early age, children begin to order the multiplicity of 
emotions and motivations that constitute their basic instincts of 
survival into the strategies of cooperation and competition that 
involve others, voluntarily—and children who are well constituted 
and fortunate manage this in a manner that is simultaneously 
socially desirable and psychologically healthy. When a child’s self- 
directed experience is interrupted by the emergence of an 
instinctual system (when the child is hungry, angry, tired, or cold), 


the good parent steps in, solving the problem disrupting the child’s 
fragile unity or, better yet, teaching the child to solve the problem 
himself. When the latter process has been completed with sufficient 
thoroughness, the child is ready to join the social world. This must 
happen by the age of four, or it may never happen.* A child must be 
sufficiently self-organizing to be desirable to his or her peers by the 
age of four or risk permanent social ostracism. A child who is still 
having temper tantrums by that age runs precisely that risk. 

The process of integration is furthered by peers—friends—for the 
child well trained or fortunate enough to be accepted. When a child 
plays a game with others, she is disciplining herself. She is learning 
to subordinate all her competing impulses to the dictates of that 
game—one thing, despite the potential multiplicity of rules; learning 
to subjugate herself voluntarily to its rules and well-defined goals. 
To play in such a manner, she must transform herself into a 
functional subunit of a larger social machine. This can be 
interpreted as a sacrifice of individuality, if individuality is defined 
as limitless choice of impulsive gratification. But it is much more 
accurately development of individuality, considered at a higher 
level: the properly functioning and integrated individual tempers 
the desires of the present with the necessities of the future 
(including the necessity of playing well with others). It is in this 
manner that the multifarious games of childhood temper the 
screaming cacophony of late infancy. The payoff for such 
development is, of course, the security of social inclusion, and the 
pleasure of the game. 

This, it should be noted, is not repression. This point must be 
made clear, as people believe that the things discipline imposed by 
choice prevents us from doing will somehow be lost forever. It is 
this belief, in large part—often expressed with regard to creativity— 
that makes so many parents afraid of damaging their children by 
disciplining them. But proper discipline organizes rather than 
destroys. A child terrified into obedience or shielded from every 
possible chance of misbehavior is not disciplined, but abused. A 
child who has been disciplined properly, by contrast—by parents, 
other adults, and most significantly, by other children—does not 


battle with, defeat, and then permanently inhibit her aggression. 
Such a child does not even sublimate that aggression, or transform 
it into something different. Instead, she integrates it into her 
increasingly sophisticated game-playing ability, allowing it to feed 
her competitiveness and heighten her attention, and making it serve 
the higher purposes of her developing psyche. A well-socialized 
child does not therefore lack aggression. She just becomes extremely 
good at being aggressive, transmuting what might otherwise be a 
disruptive drive into the focused perseverance and controlled 
competitiveness that make for a successful player. By the dawn of 
adolescence, such a child can organize herself into ever more 
complex games—joint, goal-directed activities that everyone plays 
voluntarily, and that everyone enjoys and benefits from, even if only 
one person or one team can win at a time. This ability is civilization 
itself in its nascent form, at the level of the individual player and 
group. This is where both cooperation and the opportunity to 
compete and win make themselves simultaneously manifest. This is 
all necessary preparation for the more permanent choices that must 
be made for a successful adulthood. 

It is certainly possible—and reasonable—to have some doubt and 
to argue about which game might best be played here and now; but 
it is not reasonable to state that all games are therefore 
unnecessary. Likewise, although it may be possible to argue about 
which morality is the necessary morality, it is not possible to argue 
that morality itself is thus unnecessary. Doubt about which game is 
appropriate right now is not relativism. It is the intelligent 
consideration of context. The fact that happiness is not appropriate, 
for example, at a funeral, does not mean that happiness itself lacks 
value. Likewise, the claim that morality is both necessary and 
inevitable is not totalitarian. It is merely the observation that basic, 
primitive unidimensional values must be subsumed under socially 
organized structures for peace and harmony to exist and be 
maintained. It was the bringing together of a warring multiplicity 
under the unifying doctrines of Christianity that civilized Europe. It 
could, perhaps, have been Buddhism, Confucianism, or Hinduism, 
insofar as the East is also both broadly civilized and unified. But it 


could not have been the absence of any doctrine whatsoever. 
Without a game, there is no peace, only chaos. Furthermore, the 
game that exists must be playable (as we discussed in Rule IV: 
Notice that opportunity lurks where responsibility has been 
abdicated). This means that it must be structured by a communally 
acceptable set of rules—by only those constraints that many people 
are willing to abide by, for a long time. It is possible that many such 
games exist, theoretically, but it is at least equally possible that 
there are only a few. In any case, the rules of Christianity and the 
rules of Buddhism are by no means arbitrary, by no means 
nonsensical superstition, any more than the rules of a playable 
game are merely arbitrary or nonsensically superstitious. To think 
that peace can exist without the overarching and voluntarily 
accepted game is to misunderstand the ever-present danger of the 
fragmented tribalism to which we can so easily and devastatingly 
regress. 

Once the social world has forced the child to integrate his 
multiple subpersonalities, he can play with others. After that, he 
should be ready to engage in the more serious games that make up 
jobs or professions, with their highly structured expectations, skills, 
and rules. He must learn those, as well as—when older—the dance 
of the sexes. He must integrate his socialized personality with that 
of another, so that the couple he makes with that other can exist 
together peacefully, productively, within society, over the long term 
—while maintaining voluntary willingness to do so. This is the dual 
process of psychological and social integration that accompanies 
apprenticeship, all associated with the outsourcing of sanity. 
Adherence to this process will make him a socially sophisticated, 
productive, and psychologically healthy adult, capable of true 
reciprocity (and, perhaps, the temporary suspension of the demand 
of reciprocity necessary to raise children). 

But the story of integration and socialization does not end here. 
This is because two things are happening at once, during an 
apprenticeship worthy of the name (just as learning to play a game 
and learning to be a good sport happen at the same time, while 
playing). Initially, the apprentice must become a servant of 


tradition, of structure, and of dogma, just as the child who wants to 
play must follow the rules of the game. At its best, this servitude 
means grateful alliance, in one form or another, with the 
institutions typically considered patriarchal. Apprenticeship means 
heat and pressure (as new workmen are tried by their peers, as 
articling law students are tried by their employers, as medical 
residents are tried by physicians, nurses, and patients). The goal of 
this heat and pressure is subordination of an undeveloped 
personality (by no means “individual” at this point) to a single path, 
for the purposes of transformation from undisciplined beginner to 
accomplished master. 

The master, who is the rightful product of apprenticeship, is, 
however, no longer the servant of dogma. Instead, he is now himself 
served by dogma, which he has the responsibility to maintain as 
well as the right to change, when change is necessary. This makes 
the master, who once allowed himself to be enslaved, an emergent 
follower of spirit—the wind (spirit) that bloweth where it listeth 
(John 3:8). The master can allow himself his intuitions, as the 
knowledge obtained by the discipline he has acquired will enable 
him to criticize his own ideas and assess their true value. He may 
therefore more clearly perceive the fundamental patterns or 
principles that underlie the dogmas of his discipline, and draw 
inspiration from those, instead of blindly adhering to the rules as 
currently articulated or embodied. He may even rely on the 
integrated union of his personality and his training to modify or 
transform even those more fundamental, deeply intuited principles, 
in the service of an even higher union. 


DOGMA AND SPIRIT 


The limiting disciplines that serve both as precondition for a game 
and for the development of a unity of being can usefully be 
considered Thou Shalt Nots—rules that highlight what is definitely 
not to be done, while whatever is supposed to be done is taking 
place. Abiding by these rules produces a development of character— 


character with a particular nature or essence (we have already 
discussed this as, say, the development of personal desirability as a 
player of many games, or sequences of games). As is the case in 
many other situations, it appears that this idea is already implicit in 
the stories that make up the bedrock of our culture. This is 
particularly evident in the Gospel of Mark, which is a commentary 
on what are among the most influential Rules of the Game ever 
formulated—the Mosaic Ten Commandments (and, even more 
broadly, a commentary on rules themselves). The commandments 
follow: 


1. Though shalt have no other gods before me. 

2. Though shalt not make unto thee any graven image. 

3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain. 

4. Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 

5. Honor thy father and thy mother. 

6. Thou shalt not kill. 

7. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

8. Thou shalt not steal. 

9. Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbor. 
10. Thou shalt not covet. 


The first speaks to the necessity of aiming at the highest possible 
unity; the second to the danger of worshipping false idols (by 
confusing the representation, or the image, with the ineffable it is 
supposed to represent); the third means that it is wrong to claim 
moral inspiration from God while knowingly committing sinful 
acts; the fourth means that it is necessary to leave time to regularly 
consider what is truly valuable or sacred; the fifth keeps families 
together, mandating honor, respect, and gratitude from children as 
just reward for the sacrifices made by parents; the sixth prevents 
murder (obviously) but, by doing so, also protects the community 
from potential descent into constant and potentially 
multigenerational feuding; the seventh mandates the sacredness of 
the marriage vow, predicated on the assumption (like the fifth) that 


the stability and value of the family is of paramount importance; the 
eighth allows for honest, hardworking people to reap the benefits of 
their efforts without fear that what they have produced will be taken 
from them arbitrarily (and, thereby, makes civilized society a 
possibility); the ninth maintains the integrity of the law, reducing or 
eliminating its use as a weapon; and the tenth is a reminder that 
envy and the resentment it breeds is a destructive force of the 
highest power. 

It is worthwhile thinking of these Commandments as a minimum 
set of rules for a stable society—an iterable social game. The 
Commandments are rules established in the book of Exodus, and 
part of that unforgettable story. But they are also pointers to 
something else—something that simultaneously emerges from and 
transcends the rules and constitutes their essence. The core idea is 
this: subjugate yourself voluntarily to a set of socially determined 
rules—those with some tradition in their formulation—and a unity 
that transcends the rules will emerge. That unity constitutes what 
you could be, if you concentrate on a particular goal and see it 
through. 

There is a story relevant to this idea in the Gospel of Mark. The 
pertinent section begins with Christ journeying to the temple of 
Jerusalem, where He casts out the moneychangers and merchants 
and addresses the crowd with an irresistible charisma. And, as the 
tale goes, “the scribes and chief priests heard it, and sought how 
they might destroy him: for they feared him, because all the people 
was astonished at his doctrine” (Mark 11:18). In consequence, they 
begin to conspire, questioning this strange prophet, hoping to entice 
Him into a heretical and therefore potentially fatal statement, 
sending to Him “certain of the Pharisees and of the Herodians, to 
catch him in his words” (Mark 12:13). Christ deals masterfully, to 
say the least, with the questioners, reducing them to an aggrieved 
and resentful silence. The section ends with what is arguably the 
most difficult and treacherous of questions, posed by a particularly 
cunning but also perhaps begrudgingly admiring interlocutor (Mark 
12:28-34): 


And one of the scribes came, and having heard them 
reasoning together, and perceiving that he had answered 
them well, asked him, Which is the first commandment of 
all? 

And Jesus answered him, The first of all the 
commandments is, Hear, O Israel; The Lord our God is 
one Lord: 

And thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, 
and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all 
thy strength: this is the first commandment. 

And the second is like, namely this, Thou shalt love thy 
neighbor as thyself. There is none other commandment 
greater than these. 

And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast 
said the truth: for there is one God; and there is none 
other but he: 

And to love him with all the heart, and with all the 
understanding, and with all the soul, and with all the 
strength, and to love his neighbor as himself, is more than 
all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. 

And when Jesus saw that he answered discreetly, he 
said unto him, Thou art not far from the kingdom of God. 
And no man after that durst ask him any question. 


What does this all mean? The personality integrated by 
disciplined adherence to a set of appropriate rules is simultaneously 
(although perhaps unknowingly) guided by or imitating the highest 
possible ideal—precisely that ideal that constitutes whatever 
common element of “moral” makes all the rules good, just, and 
necessary. That ideal, according to Christ’s answer, is something 
singular (the “one Lord”), thoroughly embodied (loved with “all thy 
heart,” “soul,” “understanding,” and “strength”), and then 
manifested as a love that is identical for self and all mankind. 

Western culture is “unconsciously” underpinned by a very 
profound drama, reflecting all this, because of its origin in Judeo- 


Christian conceptualization. Psychologically speaking, Christ is a 
representation, or an embodiment, of the mastery of dogma and the 
(consequent) emergence of spirit. Spirit is the creative force that 
gives rise to what becomes dogma, with time. Spirit is also that 
which constantly transcends such time-honored tradition, when 
possible. It is for this reason that an apprenticeship ends with a 
masterpiece, the creation of which signifies not only the acquisition 
of the requisite skill, but the acquisition of the ability to create new 
skills. 

Although Christ commits many acts that might be considered 
revolutionary, as we discussed in Rule I, He is nonetheless explicitly 
portrayed in the Gospels as the master of tradition, and says of 
Himself, “Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the 
prophets: I am not come to destroy, but to fulfill” (Matthew 5:17, 
KJV). The New International Version of the Bible perhaps puts it 
more comprehensibly: “Do not think that I have come to abolish the 
Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill 
them.” Christ therefore presents Himself as both the product of 
tradition, and the very thing that creates and transforms it. The 
same pattern of creative conflict pervades the Old Testament, which 
is in large part a series of stories about the spirit in prophetic 
opposition to the inevitable corruption of dogma harnessed to serve 
power. It is the personality who mimics that model who might be 
regarded as truly Western, in the deepest of psychological senses. 

If you work as hard as you can on one thing, you will change. You 
will start to also become one thing, instead of the clamoring 
multitude you once were. That one thing, developed properly, is not 
only the disciplined entity formed by sacrifice, commitment, and 
concentration. It is that which creates, destroys, and transforms 
discipline itself—civilization itself—by expressing its unity of 
personality and society. It is the very Word of truth, upon whose 
function all habitable order, wrenched out of chaos, eternally 
depends. 

Work as hard as you possibly can on at least one thing and see 
what happens.

RULE VIII 


TRY TO MAKE ONE ROOM IN YOUR HOME AS 
BEAUTIFUL AS POSSIBLE 


CLEANING YOUR ROOM IS NOT ENOUGH 


I have become known for encouraging people to clean up their 
rooms. Perhaps that is because I am serious about that prosaic piece 
of advice, and because I know that it is a much more difficult task 
than it appears. I have been unsuccessfully cleaning up my room, by 
the way—my home office (which I generally keep in relatively 
pristine condition)—for about three years now. My life was thrown 
into such chaos over that period by the multitude of changes I 
experienced—political controversies, transformation of career, 
endless travel, mountains of mail, the sequence of illnesses—that I 
simply became overwhelmed. The disorganization was heightened 
by the fact that my wife and I had just finished having much of our 
house renovated, and everything we could not find a proper place 
for ended up in my office. 

There is a meme floating around the internet, accusing me of 
hypocrisy on account of this: a still taken from a video I shot in my 
office, with a fair bit of mess in the background (and I cannot say 
that I look much better myself). Who am I to tell people to clean up 
their rooms before attempting to fix the rest of the world when, 
apparently, I cannot do it myself? And there is something directly 
synchronistic and meaningful about that objection, because I am 
not in proper order at that moment myself, and my condition 
undoubtedly found its reflection in the state of my office. More 


piled up every day, as I traveled, and everything collected around 
me. I plead exceptional circumstances, and I put many other things 
in order during the time my office was degenerating, but I still have 
a moral obligation to get back in there and put it right. And the 
problem is not just that I want to clean up the mess. I also want to 
make it beautiful: my room, my house, and then, perhaps, in 
whatever way I can manage, the community. God knows it is crying 
out for it. 

Making something beautiful is difficult, but it is amazingly 
worthwhile. If you learn to make something in your life truly 
beautiful—even one thing—then you have established a relationship 
with beauty. From there you can begin to expand that relationship 
out into other elements of your life and the world. That is an 
invitation to the divine. That is the reconnection with the 
immortality of childhood, and the true beauty and majesty of the 
Being you can no longer see. You must be daring to try that. 

If you study art (and literature and the humanities), you do it so 
that you can familiarize yourself with the collected wisdom of our 
civilization. This is a very good idea—a veritable necessity—because 
people have been working out how to live for a long time. What they 
have produced is strange but also rich beyond comparison, so why 
not use it as a guide? Your vision will be grander and your plans 
more comprehensive. You will consider other people more 
intelligently and completely. You will take care of yourself more 
effectively. You will understand the present more profoundly, 
rooted as it is in the past, and you will come to conclusions much 
more carefully. You will come to treat the future, as well, as a more 
concrete reality (because you will have developed some true sense 
of time) and be less likely to sacrifice it to impulsive pleasure. You 
will develop some depth, gravitas, and true thoughtfulness. You will 
speak more precisely, and other people will become more likely to 
listen to and cooperate productively with you, as you will with them. 
You will become more your own person, and less a dull and hapless 
tool of peer pressure, vogue, fad, and ideology. 

Buy a piece of art. Find one that speaks to you and make the 
purchase. If it is a genuine artistic production, it will invade your 


life and change it. A real piece of art is a window into the 
transcendent, and you need that in your life, because you are finite 
and limited and bounded by your ignorance. Unless you can make a 
connection to the transcendent, you will not have the strength to 
prevail when the challenges of life become daunting. You need to 
establish a link with what is beyond you, like a man overboard in 
high seas requires a life preserver, and the invitation of beauty into 
your life is one means by which that may be accomplished. 

It is for such reasons that we need to understand the role of art, 
and stop thinking about it as an option, or a luxury, or worse, an 
affectation. Art is the bedrock of culture itself. It is the foundation 
of the process by which we unite ourselves psychologically, and 
come to establish productive peace with others. As it is said, “Man 
shall not live by bread alone” (Matthew 4:4). That is exactly right. 
We live by beauty. We live by literature. We live by art. We cannot 
live without some connection to the divine—and beauty is divine— 
because in its absence life is too short, too dismal, and too tragic. 
And we must be sharp and awake and prepared so that we can 
survive properly, and orient the world properly, and not destroy 
things, including ourselves—and beauty can help us appreciate the 
wonder of Being and motivate us to seek gratitude when we might 
otherwise be prone to destructive resentment. 


MEMORY AND VISION 


The pride of the peacock is the glory of God. 

The lust of the goat is the bounty of God. 

The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God. 

The nakedness of woman is the work of God. 

Excess of sorrow laughs. Excess of joy weeps. 

The roaring of lions, the howling of wolves, the raging of the 
stormy sea, and the destructive sword, are portions of 
eternity too great for the eye of man. 


— WILLIAM BLAKE, FROM “PROVERBS OF HELL,” The Marriage of 
Heaven and Hell 


When I was a child, I knew the contours and details of all the 
houses in my immediate neighborhood. I knew the back alleys, the 
places behind the fences, the location of each crack in the pavement, 
and the shortcuts that could be taken from one place to another. My 
geographical locale was not large, but I had explored it thoroughly 
and my knowledge of it was very detailed. Now that I am an adult, 
the same is not true. I lived in Fairview, the town I grew up in for 
most of my childhood and adolescence, for only nine years, but I am 
still able to picture in high resolution the street I lived on. I have 
lived in Toronto, on the same street, for more than twice as long, 
but I still have only a vague sense of the houses that surround mine. 

I do not think that is a good thing. I feel far less at home because 
of it. It is as if when I walk down the street and glance at a local 
house, I think of “house” as an icon (because, really, what practical 
difference does it make to me what particularities characterize each 
house?), and then my attention is turned to something else. I do not 
see the house, with its specific shingles, colors, flowers, and 
architectural details, despite the interest that might have been 
elicited in me had I paid careful attention. By this point in my life, I 
have seen so many houses in so many places that I know what a 
house is likely to do when I walk by it—which is very little. Thus, I 
ignore the engaging idiosyncrasies and beauties of its details—its 
unique character, for better or worse—and see just enough to stay 
oriented as I walk past and continue to think and be elsewhere as I 
do so. There is real loss in that. Iam simply not there in my adult 
neighborhood the same way I was as a child in my hometown. I am 
separated from the reality of the world. And a very deep feeling of 
belonging is missing in some important way because of that. 

Perception has been replaced for me with functional, pragmatic 
memory. This has made me more efficient, in some ways, but the 
cost is an impoverished experience of the richness of the world. I 
remember when I started working as a junior professor in Boston, 
when my kids were about two and three years old. I was very 
preoccupied with my work, trying to keep up, trying to advance my 
career, trying to make enough money to support my family on a 
single income. I would come home and take a walk with Tammy and 


our children, Mikhaila and Julian. I found it very difficult to remain 
patient with them. I had too much work to do, always—or believed I 
did—and had disciplined myself through years of effort to focus 
continually on that. If we went for a walk, I wanted to know exactly 
where we were going, just how long it would take to get there, and 
precisely when we were going back. This is no attitude to adopt 
when trying to have a pleasant and reasonable time with toddlers. 
Not if you want to immerse yourself in the experience. Not if you 
want to watch and participate in the pleasure they take in their 
timeless discovery. Not unless you want to risk missing something 
of crucial import. 

It was very difficult for me to relax and focus on the present and 
watch my little kids pursue their meandering route through the 
neighborhood, with no particular destination, purpose, or schedule 
in mind, engaging themselves deeply in an encounter with a local 
dog, bug, or earthworm, or in some game they invented on the way. 
Now and then, however, I could snap briefly into that same frame of 
reference (that is one of the wonderful gifts provided by young 
children) and see the pristine world they inhabited, still 
untrammeled by practiced and efficient memory, capable of 
producing pure joy in the newness of everything. But I was still 
possessed enough by my future concerns to be involuntarily pulled 
back into intense preoccupation with getting the next thing done. 

I knew perfectly well that I was missing out on beauty and 
meaning and engagement, regardless of whatever advantages in 
efficiency my impatience brought. I was narrow, sharp, and focused, 
and did not waste time, but the price I paid for that was the 
blindness demanded by efficiency, accomplishment, and order. I 
was no longer seeing the world. I was seeing only the little I needed 
to navigate it with maximum speed and lowest cost. None of that 
was surprising. I had the responsibilities of an adult. I hada 
demanding job. I had to take care of my family, and that meant 
sacrificing the present and attending to the future. But having little 
children around and noticing their intense preoccupation with the 
present, and their fascination with what was directly around them, 
made me very conscious of the loss that accompanied maturity. 


Great poets are expressly aware of this, and they do what they can to 
remind the rest of us: 


There was a time when meadow, grove, and stream, 
The earth, and every common sight, 

To me did seem 

Apparelled in celestial light, 

The glory and the freshness of a dream. 

It is not now as it hath been of yore;— 

Turn wheresoe’er I may, 

By night or day. 

The things which I have seen I now can see no more.... 
Ye blesséd creatures, I have heard the call 

Ye to each other make; I see 

The heavens laugh with you in your jubilee; 
My heart is at your festival, 

My head hath its coronal, 

The fulness of your bliss, I feel—I feel it all. 
Oh evil day! if I were sullen 

While Earth herself is adorning, 

This sweet May-morning, 

And the Children are culling 

On every side, 

In a thousand valleys far and wide, 

Fresh flowers; while the sun shines warm, 
And the Babe leaps up on his Mother’s arm:— 
I hear, I hear, with joy I hear! 

—But there’s a Tree, of many, one, 

A single field which I have looked upon, 

Both of them speak of something that is gone; 
The Pansy at my feet 

Doth the same tale repeat: 

Whither is fled the visionary gleam? 

Where is it now, the glory and the dream? 


—WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, “ODE: INTIMATIONS OF 
IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD” 


Some, in fact, never lose the glorious vision of childhood. This is 
particularly true of artists (and, indeed, seems a vital part of what 
makes them artists). William Blake, the English painter, 
printmaker, and poet, appears to have been one such person. He 
inhabited a uniquely visionary world. Blake perceived something 
closer to what the philosopher Immanuel Kant termed “the thing in 
itself”* than do most mortals, left as we are with the pale reflection 
of our surroundings that our increasingly restricted mature 
perceptions deliver to us. Blake was also exquisitely sensitive to the 
metaphoric or dramatic significance of each apparently isolated 
event—the manner in which each event is rife with endless 
poetically echoing connotations: 


Every Farmer Understands 

Every Tear from Every Eye 

Becomes a Babe in Eternity 

This is caught by Females bright 

And returnd to its own delight 

The Bleat the Bark Bellow & Roar 

Are Waves that Beat on Heavens Shore 
The Babe that weeps the Rod beneath 
Writes Revenge in realms of Death 
The Beggars Rags fluttering in Air 
Does to Rags the Heavens tear 

The Soldier armd with Sword & Gun 
Palsied strikes the Summers Sun 

The poor Mans Farthing is worth more 
Than all the Gold on Africs Shore 

One Mite wrung from the Labrers hands 
Shall buy & sell the Misers Lands 

Or if protected from on high 

Does that whole Nation sell & buy 

He who mocks the Infants Faith 


Shall be mockd in Age & Death 

He who shall teach the Child to Doubt 
The rotting Grave shall neer get out 
He who respects the Infants faith 
Triumphs over Hell & Death 


—WILLIAM BLAKE, “AUGURIES OF INNOCENCE” (LINES 67—90) 


The vision of a true artist such as Blake is truly too much, 
because what is beyond our memotry-restricted perceptions is too 
much. It is the unfathomable totality of the world, past, present, and 
future bound up together: every level connected to every other level, 
nothing existing in isolation, everything implying something vital 
but beyond our comprehension, and all of it speaking of the 
overwhelming mystery of Being. The visionary concentrates on 
something we all see, hypothetically: a vase of flowers, perhaps, in 
all its complexity and beauty, each bloom springing forth out of 
nothingness, before its dissolution and return; a haystack in the 
spring, and its appearance in the summer, autumn, and winter, 
observing and portraying the absolute mystery of its existence, with 
its different shades of light and color, as well as the underlying 
commonality of form, which we can easily confuse with the full and 
incomprehensible actuality of what is there. 


How do you know but ev’ry Bird that cuts the airy way, Is an 
immense world of delight, clos’d by your senses five? 


—WILLIAM BLAKE, FROM “A MEMORABLE FANcy,” The Marriage 
of Heaven and Hell 


To perceive Van Gogh’s painting Irises—from which the 
illustration that begins this chapter is derived—is, for example, to 
gaze through a window back into the eternity that our perceptions 
once revealed, so that we can remember how awe inspiring and 
miraculous the world really is, under the mundane familiarity to 
which we have reduced it. To share in the artist’s perception 
reunites us with the source of inspiration that can rekindle our 


delight in the world, even if the drudgery and repetition of daily life 
has reduced what we see to the narrowest and most pragmatic of 
visions. 


But for those first affections, 

Those shadowy recollections, 

Which, be they what they may 

Are yet the fountain-light of all our day, 

Are yet a master-light of all our seeing; 
Uphold us, cherish, and have power to make 
Our noisy years seem moments in the being 
Of the eternal Silence: truths that wake, 

To perish never; 

Which neither listlessness, nor mad endeavour, 
Nor Man nor Boy, 

Nor all that is at enmity with joy, 

Can utterly abolish or destroy! 


—WILLIAM WORDSWORTH, “ODE: INTIMATIONS OF 
IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD” 


All of this is very frightening. It is frightening to perceive the 
shells of ourselves that we have become. It is frightening to glimpse, 
even for a moment, the transcendent reality that exists beyond. We 
think we border our great paintings with luxurious, elaborate 
frames to glorify them, but we do it at least as much to insist to 
ourselves that the glory of the painting itself ends at the frame. That 
bounding, that bordering, leaves the world we are familiar with 
comfortably intact and unchanged. We do not want that beauty 
reaching out past the limitations imposed on it and disturbing 
everything that is familiar. 

We do the same with museums, those asylums for genius: we 
isolate everything that is great—everything that could in principle be 
distributed throughout the world. Why cannot every small town 
have a shrine devoted to one great piece of art, instead of having 
every piece collected in a manner impossible for anyone ever to take 


in at once? Is not one masterpiece enough for a room, or even for a 
building? Ten great works of art, or a hundred, in a single room is 
absurd, given that each is a world in and of itself. Such mass 
collection is a degrading of the unique singular particularity and 
worth of what is priceless and irreplaceable. It is fear that entices us 
to imprison art. And no wonder. 


Have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you 
reckon’d the earth much? 

Have you practis’d so long to learn to read? 

Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems? 

Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the 
origin of all poems, 

You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are 
millions of suns left,) 

You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor 
look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the 
spectres in books, 

You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things 
from me, 

You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self. 


—WALT WHITMAN, “SONG OF MYSELF” 


It can be overwhelming to open ourselves up to the beauty in the 
world that we as adults have painted over with simplicity. In not 
doing so, however—in not taking a proper walk with a young child, 
for example—we lose track of the grandeur and the awe the 
untrammeled world is constantly capable of producing, and reduce 
our lives to bleak necessity. 


THE LAND YOU KNOW, THE LAND YOU DO NOT 
KNOW, AND THE LAND YOU CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE 


You inhabit the land you know, pragmatically and conceptually. But 
imagine what lies just outside of that. There exists an immense 
space of things you do not know, but which other people might 
comprehend, at least in part. Then, outside of what anyone knows, 
there is the space of things that no one at all knows. Your world is 
known territory, surrounded by the relatively unknown, surrounded 
by the absolutely unknown—surrounded, even more distantly, by 
the absolutely unknowable. Together, that is the canonical, 
archetypal landscape. The unknown manifests itself to you in the 
midst of the known. That revelation—sometimes exciting, but often 
quite painful—is the source of new knowledge. But a fundamental 
question remains: How is that knowledge generated? What is 
comprehended and understandable does not just leap in one fell 
swoop from the absolutely unknown to the thoroughly and self- 
evidently articulated. Knowledge must pass through many stages of 
analysis—a multitude of transformations—before it becomes, let us 
say, commonplace. 

The first stage is that of pure action—reflex action, at the most 
basic of levels.2 If something surprises you, you react to it first with 
your body. You crouch defensively, or freeze, or run away in panic. 
Those are all forms of representation and categorization, in nascent 
form. Crouch means predatory attack. Freeze means predatory 
threat. Panic means terror necessitating escape. The world of 
possibility begins to actualize itself with such instinctual, embodied 
action, unconscious and uncontrollable. The first realization of 
possibility, of potential, is not conceptual. It is embodied, but it is 
still representational. (It is no longer the thing in itself we referred 
to earlier, but the transmutation of that thing into a commensurate 
physical response. That is a representation.) 

Maybe you are at home, at night. Assume you are alone. It is dark 
and late. An unexpected noise startles you, and you freeze. That is 
the first transmutation: unknown noise (a pattern) to frozen 
position. Then your heart rate rises, in preparation for (unspecified) 
action.* That is the second transmutation. You are preparing to 
move. Next, your imagination populates the darkness with whatever 
might be making the noise.* That is the third transmutation, part of 


a complete and practical sequence: embodied responses (freezing 
and heart-rate increase) and then imagistic, imaginative 
representation. The latter is part of exploration, which you might 
extend by overcoming your terror and the freezing associated with it 
(assuming nothing else too unexpected happens) and investigating 
the locale, once a part of your friendly house, from where the noise 
appeared to emanate. You have now engaged in active exploration— 
a precursor to direct perception (hopefully nothing too dramatic); 
then to explicit knowledge of the source; and then back to routine 
and complacent peace, if the noise proves to be nothing of 
significance. That is how information moves from the unknown to 
the known. (Except that sometimes the noise does not prove 
insignificant. Then there is trouble.) 

Artists are the people who stand on the frontier of the 
transformation of the unknown into knowledge. They make their 
voluntary foray out into the unknown, and they take a piece of it 
and transform it into an image. Maybe they do it through 
choreography and dance—by representing the manifestation of the 
world in physical display, communicable, although not in words, to 
others. Maybe they do it by acting, which is a sophisticated form of 
embodiment and imitation, or by painting or sculpting. Perhaps 
they manage it through screenwriting, or by penning a novel. After 
all that come the intellectuals, with philosophy and criticism, 
abstracting and articulating the work’s representations and rules. 

Consider the role that creative people play in cities. They are 
typically starving a bit, because it is virtually impossible to be 
commercially successful as an artist, and that hunger is partly what 
motivates them (do not underestimate the utility of necessity). In 
their poverty, they explore the city, and they discover some ratty, 
quasi-criminal area that has seen better days. They visit, look, and 
poke about, and they think, “You know, with a little work, this area 
could be cool.” Then they move in, piece together some galleries, 
and put up some art. They do not make any money, but they civilize 
the space a bit. In doing so, they elevate and transform what is too 
dangerous into something cutting edge. Then a coffee shop pops up, 
and maybe an unconventional clothing store. The next thing you 


know, the gentrifiers move in. They are creative types, too, but more 
conservative (less desperate, perhaps; more risk averse, at least—so 
they are not the first ones on the edge of the frontier). Then the 
developers show up. And then the chain stores appear, and the 
middle or upper class establishes itself. Then the artists have to 
move, because they can no longer afford the rent. That is a loss for 
the avant-garde, but it is okay, even though it is harsh, because with 
all that stability and predictability the artists should not be there 
anymore. They need to rejuvenate some other area. They need 
another vista to conquer. That is their natural environment. 

That edge, where artists are always transforming chaos into 
order, can be a very rough and dangerous place. Living there, an 
artist constantly risks falling fully into the chaos, instead of 
transforming it. But artists have always lived there, on the border of 
human understanding. Art bears the same relationship to society 
that the dream bears to mental life. You are very creative when you 
are dreaming. That is why, when you remember a dream, you think, 
“Where in the world did that come from?” It is very strange and 
incomprehensible that something can happen in your head, and you 
have no idea how it got there or what it means. It is a miracle: 
nature’s voice manifesting itself in your psyche. And it happens 
every night. Like art, the dream mediates between order and chaos. 
So, it is half chaos. That is why it is not comprehensible. It is a 
vision, not a fully fledged articulated production. Those who 
actualize those half-born visions into artistic productions are those 
who begin to transform what we do not understand into what we 
can at least start to see. That is the role of the artist, occupying the 
vanguard. That is their biological niche. They are the initial 
civilizing agents. 

The artists do not understand full well what they are doing. They 
cannot, if they are doing something genuinely new. Otherwise, they 
could just say what they mean and have done with it. They would 
not require expression in dance, music, and image. But they are 
guided by feel, by intuition—by their facility with the detection of 
patterns—and that is all embodied, rather than articulated, at least 
in its initial stages. When creating, the artists are struggling, 


contending, and wrestling with a problem—maybe even a problem 
they do not fully understand—and striving to bring something new 
into clear focus. Otherwise they are mere propagandists, reversing 
the artistic process, attempting to transform something they can 
already articulate into image and art for the purpose of rhetorical 
and ideological victory. That is a great sin, harnessing the higher for 
the purposes of the lower. It is a totalitarian tactic, the 
subordination of art and literature to politics (or the purposeful 
blurring of the distinction between them). 

Artists must be contending with something they do not 
understand, or they are not artists. Instead, they are posers, or 
romantics (often romantic failures), or narcissists, or actors (and 
not in the creative sense). They are likely, when genuine, to be 
idiosyncratically and peculiarly obsessed by their intuition— 
possessed by it, willing to pursue it even in the face of opposition 
and the overwhelming likelihood of rejection, criticism, and 
practical and financial failure. When they are successful they make 
the world more understandable (sometimes replacing something 
more “understood,” but now anachronistic, with something new and 
better). They move the unknown closer to the conscious, social, and 
articulated world. And then people gaze at those artworks, watch the 
dramas, and listen to the stories, and they start to become informed 
by them, but they do not know how or why. And people find great 
value in it—more value, perhaps, than in anything else. There is 
good reason that the most expensive artifacts in the world—those 
that are literally, or close to literally, priceless—are great works of 
art. 

I once visited the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. It 
contained a collection of great and famous Renaissance paintings— 
each worth hundreds of millions of dollars, assuming they were 
ever made available for purchase. The area containing them was a 
shrine, a place of the divine—for believers and atheists alike. It was 
in the most expensive and prestigious of museums, located on real 
estate of the highest quality and desirability, in what might well be 
the most active and exciting city in the world. The collection had 
been put together over a great expanse of time, and with much 


difficulty. The gallery was packed with people, many of whom had 
voyaged there as part of what must be most properly regarded as a 
pilgrimage. 

I asked myself, “What are these people up to, coming to this 
place, so carefully curated, traveling these great distances, looking at 
these paintings? And what do they believe they are up to?” One 
painting featured the Immaculate Conception of Mary, brilliantly 
composed. The Mother of God was rising to heaven, in a beatific 
state, encapsulated in a mandorla of clouds, embedded with the 
faces of putti. Many of the people gathered were gazing, enraptured, 
at the work. I thought, “They do not know what that painting 
means. They do not understand the symbolic meaning of the 
mandorla, or the significance of the putti, or the idea of the 
glorification of the Mother of God. And God, after all, is dead—or, so 
goes the story. Why does the painting nonetheless retain its value? 
Why is it in this room, in this building, with these other paintings, 
in this city—carefully guarded, not to be touched? Why is this 
painting—and all these others—beyond price and desired by those 
who already have everything? Why are these creations stored so 
carefully in a modern shrine, and visited by people from all over the 
world, as if it were a duty—even as if it were desirable or 
necessary?” 

We treat these objects as if they are sacred. At least that is what 
our actions in their vicinity suggest. We gaze at them in ignorance 
and wonder, and remember what we have forgotten; perceiving, 
ever so dimly, what we can no longer see (what we are perhaps no 
longer willing to see). The unknown shines through the productions 
of great artists in partially articulated form. The awe-inspiring 
ineffable begins to be realized but retains a terrifying abundance of 
its transcendent power. That is the role of art, and that is the role of 
artists. It is no wonder we keep their dangerous, magical 
productions locked up, framed, and apart from everything else. And 
if a great piece is damaged anywhere, the news spreads worldwide. 
We feel a tremor run through the bedrock of our culture. The dream 
upon which our reality depends shakes and moves. We find 
ourselves unnerved. 


ONE ROOM 


I live with my wife in a small semidetached house, with a living 
room that cannot be larger than 12’ x 12’. But we worked to make 
that room extremely beautiful, while endeavoring to do the same 
with the rest of the house. In the living room hung some large 
paintings (not to everyone’s taste, certainly: they were Soviet 
realist/impressionist pieces, some illustrating the Second World 
War, some representing the triumph of communism), as well as a 
variety of cubist miniatures and South American pieces heavily 
influenced by the native tradition. Prior to our recent renovations 
the room had held at least twenty-five paintings, including about 
fifteen smaller pieces (12” x 12”). There was even one—reminiscent 
of a medieval etching, although painted on canvas—on the ceiling, 
where I had attached it with magnets. It was from a Romanian 
church. The largest was 6’ high and about 8’ wide. (I know perfectly 
well that aggregating all these paintings together in such a small 
space contradicts my earlier point about devoting a room or even a 
building to a single work of art, but I have only a single house, so I 
plead necessity: If I wanted to collect paintings, they had to be put 
where I was able to put them.) In the rest of the house, we used 
thirty-six different colors, and a variety of different glosses on the 
walls and the trim throughout the building—all from a palette that 
matched a large realist painting of a railway yard in Chicago in the 
1950s, created by the same artist who helped us plan and then 
renovate our home. 

I bought the Soviet pieces on eBay from Ukrainian junk dealers 
specializing in Soviet-era artifacts. At one point, I had a network of 
about twenty people in the Ukraine sending me photographs of 
whatever paintings they had scrounged from the ruins of the Soviet 
bureaucracy. Most were awful. But some were amazing. I have a 
great painting, for example, of Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, 
standing in front of a rocket and a radar installation, and another 
from the 1970s of a lonesome soldier writing his mother in front of 
a large radio. It is really something to see relatively modern events 
memorialized in oil by talented artists. (The Soviets kept their 


academies functioning continuously from the nineteenth century 
onward and, although tremendous restrictions were placed on what 
could be produced, those who passed through them became highly 
skilled painters.) 

The Soviet paintings eventually took over our house. Most of 
them were small and insanely inexpensive, and I bought dozens of 
them. The Soviet era produced its own impressionism, often 
depicting landscapes, rougher and harsher than the classic French 
versions but much to my taste and reminiscent of where I grew up 
in western Canada. While seeking them out, I exposed myself to a 
larger number of paintings, I like to think, than anyone else in 
history. For at least four years, starting in 2001, I searched eBay, 
looking at roughly a thousand paintings a day,* seeking the one or 
two in that number that were of genuine quality. It was most often a 
Russian or Soviet landscape selling for a song—better paintings than 
I had ever seen in galleries or museum collections in Toronto. I 
would place them in a list of items I was interested in—an eBay 
feature—print them out, lay them on the floor, and then ask my 
wife, Tammy, to help me narrow my choices. She has a good eye and 
a fair bit of training as an artist. We would discard anything we 
found to be flawed and purchase what remained. Because of this, 
my kids grew up surrounded by art, and it certainly left an 
impression. Many of my paintings now hang in their respective 
dwellings. (They tended to avoid the more political Soviet 
propaganda, which I was interested in because of its historical 
significance and because of the ongoing war on the canvases 
between art—a consequence of the painter’s undeniable talent—and 
the propaganda that art was doomed to serve. I can tell you that the 
art shines through the propaganda as the years pass by. That is 
something very interesting to observe.) 

I also tried, at about that time, to make my university office 
beautiful. After I was transferred from an office I had already put 
some work into, the same artist who helped redesign the interior of 
our house (and from whom I also purchased many large paintings, 
which also hang in our house) tried to help me transform my new 
factory-like, fluorescent-lit catastrophe of a 1970s sealed-windows 


hellhole office into something that someone with some sense could 
sit in for thirty years without wanting to die. Faculty members were 
forbidden to undertake any major modifications to these spaces, 
due to union requirements (or administration interpretations of 
those requirements). So, my artist friend and I devised an alternate 
plan. 

We decided to insert some heavy, nickel-plated hooks into the 
cinderblock, in pairs about four feet apart and seven feet above the 
ground, and then to hang from those hooks good three-quarter-inch 
sanded and stained wood sheets with cherry veneer on one side. 
Voila: wood-paneled office, for the cost of about eight seventy-five- 
dollar pieces of plywood, plus some labor. We were going to install 
these on a weekend, when there was no one else around. Then we 
planned to paint the drop ceilings (carefully, as asbestos lurked 
above the tiles). Hell is a place of drop ceilings, rusted ventilation 
grates, and fluorescent lights; the dismal ugliness and dreariness 
and general depression of spirit that results from these cost-saving 
features no doubt suppresses productivity far more than the 
cheapest of architectural tricks and the most deadening of lights 
saves money. Everyone looks like a corpse under fluorescents. 
Penny-wise and pound-foolish indeed. 

We were going to paint the ceiling with a paint called Hammerite, 
which looks like beaten metal once it dries. That would have 
transformed the unavoidable industrial aesthetic, which can be 
attractive if handled wisely, into something thoughtful and unique. 
This could also have been done for minimal cost. A good carpet, 
perhaps Persian (also very inexpensive on eBay), some reasonably 
high-quality curtains, and a decent industrial desk: one weekend of 
secretive work, and an office that a civilized person could inhabit 
without resentment and self-contempt. 

But I made a fatal error. I spoke to one of the senior 
administrators of the psychology department about my plans. She 
and I had previously discussed the sheer ugliness of the floor our 
area inhabited and the dismal state of all the offices, and I thought 
we had established consensus that improvement was warranted. I 
assumed she was on board. We had even talked about transforming 


her corner office. I began to excitedly share my intentions. She 
looked displeased instead of happy, and said unexpectedly, “You 
cannot do that.” I shook my head in disbelief and thought: “What? I 
am planning to make something exceedingly ugly better, quickly, 
with no trouble, for no money to speak of—and your response is, 
‘You cannot do that!?’” I said, “What do you mean?” She said, “Well, 
if you do it, everyone else will want to do it.” Four responses flashed 
through my mind: One: “No, they would not.” Two: “Everyone could 
do it, because it would be dirt cheap.” Three: “I thought we were 
sane adults, having a productive conversation about improving 
something important in a university, but we are actually children 
squabbling in a kindergarten playground.” Four: “I thought I was 
speaking with someone sane and reasonable, but I was clearly 
wrong.” She finished the conversation with a direct threat: “Do not 
push me on this.” Stupid me. I asked for permission. (Not really: I 
was trying to communicate something motivating, beautiful, and 
exciting. But it boiled down to a power game.) I shared none of my 
four responses, however—although I was sorely tempted to voice all 
of them—and immediately recalibrated my strategy. 

My artist friend and I were already more than conversant with 
the essential insanity and intransigence of mid-level bureaucracies, 
so we had already dreamed up a less expansive plan B. This involved 
the careful choosing of paint for the walls (rather than the much 
preferable wood), with some accent painting where that was 
possible, and matching carpets and drapery. I still had to fight the 
administration to get the precise colors I had chosen (which suited 
the industrial feel of the office), but won that battle. Plan B was not 
as good as plan A, but it was still much better than the status quo. 
Later, I added a dropped copper ceiling, using lightweight adhesive 
plastic tiles that mimic decorative metal quite accurately, hung a 
few paintings, and added a couple of suitable statues. Students, 
colleagues, and visitors come in and do a double take. My office is a 
place of creativity and beauty, and not a bloody horrible fluorescent- 
lit factory. Visitors are surprised, therefore—surprised, relieved, and 
pleased. 


Not long after, I discovered that the department was now bringing 
potential new hires into my office to show them what kind of 
creative freedom was possible at the University of Toronto. I 
thought that was insanely comical. I thought about all of that for a 
long time. The resistance I encountered was somewhat 
incomprehensible in its strength. I wondered, “God, people seem to 
be afraid of what I am doing in this office. Perhaps there is a reason 
—an important reason—I do not understand.” Then I came across a 
story by the biologist Robert Sapolsky. It was about wildebeest.° 
Wildebeest are herd animals and very difficult to distinguish from 
one another (maybe not for other wildebeest, but certainly for those 
who wish to study them). They blend together. At one point in the 
past, this presented a serious problem to biologists needing to 
observe individual animals for enough time to derive some 
conclusions about their behavior. They would watch a wildebeest, 
look away for a moment to make notes, and be unable to locate the 
same animal when they glanced back up. 

Eventually, they settled on a potential solution. The biologists 
drove up adjacent to the herd in a Jeep, armed with a bucket of red 
paint and a stick with a rag on it. They dabbed a red spot on one of 
the wildebeest’s haunches. Now they could track the activities of 
that particular animal, and hopefully learn something new about 
wildebeest behavior. But guess what happened to the wildebeest, 
now differentiated from the herd? The predators, always lurking 
around the herd, took it down. Lions—a major wildebeest threat— 
cannot easily bring a single wildebeest down unless they can 
identify it. They cannot hunt a blur of indistinguishable herd 
animals. They cannot track down four wildebeest at a time. They 
must organize their hunt around an identifiable individual. Thus, 
when lions go after the little ones or the ones that limp, they are not 
culling the weak, in some natural display of beneficial altruism. 
They would rather dine on a nice, healthy, delicious, juicy 
wildebeest than one that is tiny, old, or ill. But they must be able to 
identify their prey. What is the moral of the story? Make yourself 
colorful, stand out, and the lions will take you down. And the lions 
are always there. 


If you stick your neck out, then the sword will come. Many, many 
cultures have a saying like that. The English version? “The poppy 
that grows higher than the rest is the first one to have its head 
removed by the scythe.” In Japan: “The nail that sticks up above the 
rest is the first to get hit by the hammer.” This is a nontrivial 
observation: hence its commonality. Artistic, creative endeavor is 
high risk, while the probability of return is low. But the probability 
of exceptionally high return does exist, and creative endeavor, while 
dangerous and unlikely to be successful, is also absolutely vital to 
the transformation that enables us to keep our footing. Everything 
changes. Pure traditionalism is doomed for that very reason. We 
need the new, merely to maintain our position. And we need to see 
what we have become blinded to, by our very expertise and 
specialization, so that we do not lose touch with the Kingdom of 
God and die in our boredom, ennui, arrogance, blindness to beauty, 
and soul-deadening cynicism. Plus, are we helpless prey animals, 
cowering and protecting ourselves, hiding and camouflaging, or are 
we human beings? 


NOT DECORATION 


People are often upset by abstract art, or by art that appears to 
devote itself to producing negative reactions such as disgust or 
horror merely for the shock value. I have a tremendous respect for 
ideals of traditional beauty and, therefore, some sympathy for that 
response, and there is little doubt that many who merely disdain 
tradition mask the sentiment with artistic pretension. However, the 
passage of time differentiates truly inspired work from the 
fraudulent sort, even if imperfectly, and what is not crucial is 
generally left behind. It is easy to make the opposite error, as well: 
that art should be pretty and easily appreciated, without work or 
challenge: it should be decorative; it should match the living-room 
furniture. But art is not decoration. That is the attitude of a naive 
beginner, or of someone who will not let their terror of art allow 
them to progress and learn. 


Art is exploration. Artists train people to see. Most people with 
any exposure to art now regard the work of the impressionists, for 
example, as both self-evidently beautiful and relatively traditional. 
This is in no small part because we all perceive the world now, at 
least in part, in the manner that only impressionists could manage 
in the latter half of the nineteenth century. We cannot help doing 
so, because the impressionist aesthetic has saturated everything: 
advertisements, movies, popular posters, comic books, photographs 
—all forms of visual art. Now we all see the beauty of light that only 
the impressionists could once apprehend. They taught us this. But 
when the impressionists first displayed their paintings—in the Salon 
des Refusés of 1863, as the traditional Paris Salon had rejected them 
—the pieces were met with laughter and contempt. The idea of 
perceiving that way (paying particular attention to light, essentially, 
rather than form) was so radical that it caused people to have 
emotional fits. 

I am often struck by how common even the tropes of cubism, 
much more extreme and strange in some ways than impressionism, 
have become part and parcel of our visual vernacular. I have seen 
the multidimensional but flattened faces of the genre even in comic 
books. The same is true of surrealism, which has become popularly 
integrated almost to the point of cliché. It is worth repeating: Artists 
teach people to see. It is very hard to perceive the world, and we are 
so fortunate to have geniuses to teach us how to do it, to reconnect 
us with what we have lost, and to enlighten us to the world. It is for 
such psychological reasons that lines such as Christ’s can be 
profitably considered: 


At that time the disciples came to Jesus and asked, “Who, 
then, is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven?” 

He called a little child to him, and placed the child 
among them. 

And he said: “Truly I tell you, unless you change and 
become like little children, you will never enter the 
kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 18:1—3) 


Beauty leads you back to what you have lost. Beauty reminds you 
of what remains forever immune to cynicism. Beauty beckons in a 
manner that straightens your aim. Beauty reminds you that there is 
lesser and greater value. Many things make life worth living: love, 
play, courage, gratitude, work, friendship, truth, grace, hope, virtue, 
and responsibility. But beauty is among the greatest of these. 


What though the radiance which was once so bright 
Be now for ever taken from my sight, 

Though nothing can bring back the hour 

Of splendour in the grass, of glory in the flower; 
We will grieve not, rather find 

Strength in what remains behind; 

In the primal sympathy 

Which having been must ever be; 

In the soothing thoughts that spring 

Out of human suffering; 

In the faith that looks through death, 

In years that bring the philosophic mind.

IMMORTALITY FROM RECOLLECTIONS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD”

RULE IX 


IF OLD MEMORIES STILL UPSET YOU, WRITE 
THEM DOWN CAREFULLY AND COMPLETELY 


BUT IS YESTERDAY FINISHED WITH YOU? 


Imagine you undertook some truly terrible actions in the past. You 
betrayed or hurt people in a genuinely damaging manner. You 
damaged their reputation with gossip and innuendo. You took credit 
for their work. You robbed them materially or spiritually. You 
cheated on them. Or imagine, instead, that you have been the target 
of some such events—and let us also assume you have become wise 
enough to try to avoid repeating the experience. In both 
circumstances (as perpetrator or victim) the actual events and the 
associated memories evoke fear, guilt, and shame. Why? 

In the first case, you have betrayed yourself. You did not play the 
medium- to long-term game properly, and are suffering the 
consequences. You are not the sort of person other people choose to 
have around. You might not even be the sort of person you want to 
have around. In the second case, you were badly mistreated by 
someone else. In some real sense, however, it does not matter 
whether you were suffering because of self-betrayal or at the hands 
of others. What does matter is that you do not desire any 
recurrence. 

Now, if you recall the memory, or if it comes back unbidden, 
complete with terror, shame, and guilt, this means something 
specific. It means that you fell into a hole—a pit, more accurately— 
or were pushed there. And that is not good. But what is worse is that 


you do not know why. Perhaps you trusted other people too easily. 
Perhaps you were too naive. Perhaps you were willfully blind. 
Perhaps you encountered genuine malevolence, on the part of 
another or yourself (and that is the worst situation, and the one 
most difficult to overcome). But at one level of analysis, whether 
you fell or were pushed makes little difference—not to the 
emotional systems that have emerged over the course of evolution 
and now Serve to protect you. They care about one thing and one 
thing only: that you do not repeat a mistake. 

The alarms those systems activate are fear-based (that is too 
weak a phrase—terror-based is more accurate, the kind of terror 
limited to neither time nor place), and all they care about is 
reminding you of the still-extant danger. A part of reality, and a 
perilous part, has remained unmapped, low resolution, lacking 
sufficient detail—and so has a part of you. You are not sharp, alert, 
dangerous, wary, wise, or kind enough—who knows?-—so that the 
terror systems protecting you are confident in your ability to wend 
your way successfully through the same maze if it once again 
manifests itself in front of you. 

Learn from the past. Or repeat its horrors, in imagination, 
endlessly. 

Frequently, people do not so much repress the terrible things that 
happened in the past as refuse to think them through, pushing them 
out of their mind or occupying themselves with other activities. 
They have their reasons. And sometimes traumatized people appear 
literally unable to understand what befell them. It can be 
prohibitively difficult for abused children, for example, to generate a 
worldview philosophically sophisticated enough to span the full 
spectrum of human motivation. They simply cannot understand 
why someone might torment them physically or abuse them 
sexually. If they are young enough, it is likely that they do not even 
explicitly comprehend what is happening. Comprehending such 
matters is exceptionally challenging, even for adults. But in some 
unfortunate and arguably unjust sense, it does not matter. Refusal 
or inability both leave a geographic area in memory—unexplored, 
active, and rife with danger. It is a psychological truism that 


anything sufficiently threatening or harmful once encountered can 
never be forgotten if it has never been understood.* 

To orient ourselves in the world, we need to know where we are 
and where we are going. Where we are: that concept must optimally 
include a full account of our experience of the world to date. If you 
do not know what roads you have traversed, it is difficult to 
calculate where you are. Where we are going: that is the projection 
of our ultimate ideal—by no means simply a question, say, of 
accomplishment, love, wealth, or power, but development of the 
character that makes all fortunate outcomes more likely and all 
unfortunate outcomes less likely. We map the world so that we can 
make the move from where we are—from point A—to where we are 
going—to point B. We use our map to guide our movement, and we 
encounter successes and obstacles along the way. 

The successes are both confidence building and exhilarating. Not 
only are we moving toward our ultimate desire, we appear to be 
doing so properly (and are therefore not only moving ahead but 
validating our map). The obstacles and failures are, by contrast, 
anxiety provoking, depressing, and painful. They indicate our 
profound ignorance. They indicate that we do not understand with 
sufficient depth where we have been, where we are, or where we are 
going. They indicate that something we have built with great 
difficulty and wish above all to protect is flawed—to a degree both 
serious and not fully understood. 

We must recollect our experiences and derive from them their 
moral. Otherwise, we remain in the past, plagued by reminiscences, 
tormented by conscience, cynical for the loss of what might have 
been, unforgiving of ourselves, and unable to accept the challenges 
and tragedies facing us. We must recollect ourselves or suffer in 
direct proportion to our ignorance and avoidance. We must gather 
everything from the past that we avoided. We must rekindle every 
lost opportunity. We must repent for missing the mark, meditate on 
our errors, acquire now what we should have acquired then, and put 
ourselves back together. And I am not saying this is always possible. 
I have seen people so lost that there was not enough spark left to 
survive. The person in the present had been rendered too 


insignificant to confront, in his or her current condition, what was 
avoided even by a once-healthier self in the past. And cynicism 
about the future rationalizes the avoidance and deception. That is 
hell, and there is no limit to its depth. The humility required to 
clamber out of such hell exists in precise proportion to the 
magnitude of the unrequited errors of the past. And that is enough 
to send a shudder of true terror down the spine of anyone even 
partly awakened. We are not allowed, it seems, to avoid the 
responsibility of actualizing potential. And if we have made a 
mistake in the past, and left what could be unmanifest—regardless 
of the reason—then we pay the price for that in the inability to 
forget, and in the emotion that constitutes the pangs of conscience 
for past misbehavior. 

Imagine that when you are very young, the map of the world you 
use to guide your immature self is correspondingly underdeveloped, 
like a child’s drawing of a house: always straight and centered, 
portraying only the front; always (or close enough) with a door and 
two windows; always with a square for the outside wall anda 
triangle for the roof; always with a chimney and smoke (which is a 
surprise, because smoking chimneys are not all that common now). 
The sun is shining irrepressibly—a circle with rays emanating from 
it. There are a few flowers—single lines with the schematic of a 
bloom at the top, and two leaves halfway up the “stems.” It is a very 
low-resolution representation of a house. It is more hieroglyph than 
drawing; more concept than sketch. It is something that represents 
the idea of house, or perhaps home, generically, like the words 
“house” or “home” themselves. However, it is almost always 
enough: The child who drew the picture knows it is a house, and the 
other children and the adults who see the picture know it is a house. 
The drawing does the trick. It fulfills its purpose. It is a good- 
enough map. 

But all too often appalling events occur within houses. These are 
not so easy to represent. Maybe the house has adults in it—parents, 
grandparents, uncles, or aunts—who say such things as “Never—and 
I mean never—speak to anyone about what happens here.” A few 
squares, a triangle, a smattering of flowers, and a benevolent solar 


orb offer only an inadequate representation of the horrors 
characterizing such a dwelling place. Maybe what is happening 
inside the house is beyond both tolerability and understanding. But 
how can what is terrifying be beyond understanding? How can 
trauma even exist without comprehension? Is not understanding in 
some sense a prerequisite to experience itself? These are all great 
mysteries. But everything is not experienced at the same level of 
conception. We have all been petrified by the unknown, even 
though that seems a contradiction in terms. But the body knows 
what the mind does not yet grasp. And it remembers. And it 
demands that understanding be established. And there is simply no 
escaping that demand. If something befalls us—or, perhaps worse, 
we engage in some act—that freezes us in terror and nauseates us to 
recall, we are bound by implacable fate to transform raw horror into 
understanding, or suffer the consequences. 


DO NOT FALL TWICE INTO THE SAME PIT 


I had a client who began speaking to me almost immediately after 
we met of the sexual abuse she suffered in childhood at the hands 
of of an older cousin, with whom she lived. She became markedly 
tearful and upset when she recounted her experiences. I asked her 
how old she was when the abuse occurred. She told me she was 
four. She described her attacker as much larger, stronger, and older 
than her. I allowed my imagination to roam freely as she spoke, 
making the assumptions I believed (or my fantasy presumed) were 
justified by the nature of her description. I envisioned the nefarious, 
sadistic, and criminal machinations of a late adolescent or young 
adult. Then I asked her how much difference in age there was 
between her and her victimizer. She replied, “Two years. He was two 
years older than me.” This came as a genuine surprise. It changed 
the picture in my mind almost completely. 

I told her what I had been imagining, because I wanted her to 
know what assumptions I had been formulating as she related her 
story. Then I said, “You know, you are all grown up now, and have 


been for a long time. But you told me your story in the same way 
that you might have told it when you were four, when the 
molestation was still occurring—or at least with many of the same 
emotions. And there is no doubt that you remember your cousin as 
much larger and stronger and older than you. A six-year-old is, after 
all, half again as old as a four-year-old, and from that younger 
child’s perspective, perhaps more akin to an adult. But your cousin 
was six—almost as much a child as you. So, here is another way you 
might consider thinking about what happened. First, recall the six- 
year-olds with whom you are now familiar. You know that they are 
still immature and cannot be held accountable as adults might be 
for their actions, even though they might also not be altogether 
innocent. I am not trying to minimize the seriousness of what 
happened to you, and I am not questioning the intensity of your 
emotions. But I am asking you to consider the situation as if you 
became aware of its occurrence among two children you presently 
know. Kids are curious. They play doctor. And if the adults around 
them are not paying attention properly, such games can get out of 
hand. Would it be possible to consider that you were not molested 
by an overpowering and malevolent force—the way you might be if 
you were raped now? Maybe, instead, you and your cousin were 
very poorly supervised children.” 

In some important way, the memories she retained of her 
childhood experiences had not altered as she matured. She was still 
experiencing the terror of a four-year-old, helpless in the hands of 
someone old enough to be perceived as grown-up. But her twenty- 
seven-year-old self needed to update that memory. She was no 
longer at risk for such treatment, in any obvious manner. And it 
came as a great relief to her to reframe what had happened. She 
could now consider it as a potential consequence of curiosity 
untrammeled by adult attention. This shifted her view of her cousin, 
the situation, and herself. She could now see the event from the 
perspective of an adult. This freed her from much of the terror and 
shame still associated with the memories, and it did so with 
remarkable rapidity. She confronted the horrors of the past 
voluntarily, finding a causal explanation that was much less 


traumatic—lacking, as it did, the vision of her cousin as a 
malevolent, powerful perpetrator and her as the inevitably hapless 
victim of such a force. All this transformation occurred in a single 
session. Such can be the power of the story surrounding the terrible 
events of our pasts. 

This experience left me with a profound philosophical quandary. 
The memories my client brought into my office had remained 
unchanged for decades. The memories she walked out with were 
markedly altered. Which, then, were real? It could easily be argued 
that her original story was more accurate. It was, after all, as direct 
an imprint as might be left on the open book of a four-year-old’s 
mind. It had not been altered (and therefore changed) by any 
previous therapeutic intervention. Was it not, then, the genuine 
article? But it is also the case that an event that means one thing 
one day might come to mean something quite different another. Is 
it so unusual for us to better understand what motivated the 
otherwise inexplicable behavior of our parents, for example, as we 
ourselves enter parenthood? And which memory is more accurate: 
the partial picture of adult motivation we have as children, or the 
revised recollections made possible by maturity? If it is the latter— 
and that does not seem unreasonable (and certainly seemed true in 
the case of my client)—how is it that an altered memory can become 
more accurate than one retaining its original configuration? 


POSSESSED BY GHOSTS 


I recall another client who remembered, in a striking sense, and 
changed. His memories were shrouded much more profoundly in 
mystery, and his remembrance was of a slower, more surprising, 
and unlikelier sort. He was a young, gay African American man who 
was suffering from a set of incomprehensible mental and physical 
symptoms. A psychiatrist had recently diagnosed him with 
schizophrenia, but his aunt, who had taken him to the hospital for 
evaluation, believed that insufficient time had been spent on her 


nephew’s evaluation. She contacted me for a second opinion and 
brought him to my office. I saw him alone. 

He was shy and reserved, but neatly and carefully dressed, and 
appeared fully oriented when I started to gather his history. 
Furthermore, he wore eyeglasses—and they were well taken care of, 
lacking tape on the bridge or arms, and with lenses that were 
perfectly clean. These observations were all relevant, as far as I was 
concerned. Schizophrenics lose the ability to monitor themselves 
effectively, so unkempt clothing and damaged eyeglasses— 
particularly with badly smudged lenses—are telling features (not 
invariably: so those of you with subpar eyewear are not required to 
consider yourself classified). In any case, he also had a full-time job 
of reasonable complexity (another rarity for someone with 
schizophrenia), and he could carry on a conversation with no 
problem, apart from his tendency toward shyness. I accepted him as 
a client, and we began to meet regularly. 

I had to see him a few times before I could determine why the 
psychiatrist had diagnosed him with such a serious disorder. He 
began by telling me that for the last four years he had been 
depressed and anxious. There was nothing markedly uncommon in 
that. His symptoms followed on the heels of a serious fight with his 
boyfriend and the permanent cessation of their relationship, which 
had lasted several years. Nothing in that was unusual, either. The 
two had been living together. Their partnership was important to 
him, emotionally and practically—and the dissolution of an intimate 
relationship produces unhappiness and confusion in most everyone, 
and can trigger more severe and lasting anxiety and depression in 
people who are so predisposed. The duration was out of the 
ordinary, however. People typically pick up the pieces and move on 
in under a year. That is not a hard-and-fast rule, but four years is a 
long time. That piqued my curiosity. He also revealed something 
else very much out of the ordinary. He told me that he experienced 
strange, convulsive bodily movements—every night—while 
attempting to sleep. His body would contort into a fetal position, 
and his arms would cross over his face. Then he would relax, only to 
find himself repeating the movements. So it went, for hours. Apart 


from being concerning because of its incomprehensibility, it was 
interfering badly with his sleep. This had been going on for about 
the same amount of time as the anxiety and depression, and the 
poor sleep, if not the movements themselves, was certainly a 
contributing factor. I asked him what he thought was happening. He 
said, with a laugh, “My family thinks I am possessed, and I am not 
sure they are wrong.” 

My client’s familial background was somewhat unusual. His 
parents, immigrants to Canada from the southern United States, 
were uneducated to a marked degree, very superstitious and 
religious, and apparently serious in the belief that spirits inhabited 
their son. I asked him, “Did you by chance tell the psychiatrist about 
being possessed?” He said, “Yes.” I thought, “Well, that explains 
why he diagnosed you with schizophrenia.” That explanation, in 
tandem with the strange physical symptoms, would have been 
sufficient, in my experience.* However, after meeting with this man 
for several sessions, it was clear to me that whatever was plaguing 
him was not schizophrenia. He was perfectly rational and lucid. But 
what in the world could be causing these strange, nightly, seizure- 
like convulsions? I had never encountered anything of the sort. My 
first hypothesis was that he suffered from a very severe form of 
sleep paralysis. This is a reasonably common condition. It generally 
occurs when people are sleeping on their backs (which he tended to 
do). A person with sleep paralysis semi-awakens, but not enough to 
stop dreaming, nor to escape from the inability to move that 
characterizes the rapid-eye-movement (REM) phase of sleeping. 
When you are dreaming, the same brain areas that govern active 
movement when you are awake are often stimulated (you 
experience this as the sense of moving while in your dream). You do 
not move around in sync with that brain activation because your 
voluntary musculature is switched off, physiologically, by a 
specialized neurochemical mechanism that has exactly that 
function.* Otherwise you would get out of bed and act out your 
dream and get yourself into trouble very quickly. 

During a sleep paralysis episode, the sufferer wakes up enough to 
be semi-aware of the real world, but is still in REM paralysis and 


dreaming. All sorts of strange experiences can occur in such a state. 
Many people have, for example, claimed to have been abducted and 
medically examined by aliens.* This otherwise inexplicable 
nighttime phenomenon (barring the existence of curious and 
surgically inclined extraterrestrials) has been blamed on this 
condition of immobility and the often bizarre and frightening 
fantasies that accompany it.* He was quite bright, literate, and 
curious, so I gave him a book called The Terror That Comes in the 
Night, which illuminates the strange phenomena that can 
accompany sleep paralysis. The author, David Hufford, describes the 
night terror his title refers to as a variant of the “Old Hag” 
experience (a term from folklore). Those who have had such an 
experience (up to 15 percent of the population) describe fear and 
paralysis, sensations of suffocation, and encounters with malign 
entities. My client read the book, but told me that he did not believe 
what Hufford described accurately characterized her experience. He 
felt the same way about the sleep paralysis hypothesis more 
generally. For one thing, the convulsions occurred before he fell 
asleep; second, he did not experience the inability to move. 

I learned much more about him as we continued to get to know 
one another. I learned, for example, that he had studied history as 
an undergraduate, and had completed his degree. I learned that his 
parents had been exceptionally strict with him through his 
childhood and teenage years. They never allowed him to stay 
overnight at his friends’ houses, and they monitored his behavior 
very closely until he escaped to university. He also related a fair bit 
more about the fight that occurred immediately before the breakup 
of his last relationship. He had returned with his boyfriend to their 
shared apartment after having a few drinks and arguing in public. At 
home, the fight escalated to physical conflict. They began pushing 
each other around, with increasing violence. After one particularly 
aggressive shove, my client fell to the living room floor. While lying 
there, he swept his boyfriend’s feet out from underneath him. Then 
my client picked himself up off the floor and headed for the door. 
He returned several days later when he knew he would not be at 


home to pack up his belongings and move. That was the end of their 
existence as a couple. 

But there was an element of his personality at play in this conflict 
that was not obvious. In consequence, he was struck very deeply by 
his boyfriend’s assault. He told me while discussing this sequence 
of events that he did not believe people were capable of violence. I 
said, “What do you mean by that? You earned a history degree. You 
have obviously read about the horrors and atrocities of the human 
past. You watch the news...” He said that, as a matter of fact, he 
did not watch the news. “Fair enough,” I replied, “but what about 
everything you learned in university? Did not that teach you that 
human aggression is both real and exceptionally common?” He said, 
“T read the books, but I just put everything I had learned into a 
compartment and did not think any further about it.” I thought that 
was a Striking answer, particularly in combination with something 
else he told me. “When I was a child,” he said, “I picked up the idea 
that people were only good. My parents taught me that adults were 
angels.” I asked, “What do you mean by that? That adults never did 
anything bad or wrong?” He said, “No, you do not understand. My 
parents taught me and my sister and brother that adults were 
literally God’s angels, and that they were only good.” I said, “You 
believed this?” He said that he had believed it deeply, partly because 
he had been so sheltered, partly because his parents had been so 
insistent, and partly, of course, because it was comforting. 

I suggested that something had to be done about his naivete. It 
was not doing him any good. He was far too old and intelligent to 
maintain faith in such a childish dream. We discussed this in detail, 
speaking about the horrific events of the twentieth century and the 
mass shootings and other terrors of the more recent past. I asked 
him to explain such occurrences, and to pay more attention to any 
examples of his own anger and hostility. However, he denied the 
very existence of the latter and could not generate any convincing 
explanations for the former. 

So, I assigned him a book called Ordinary Men.® That book 
excruciatingly details how a group of ordinary policemen from 
Germany were turned into cold-blooded executioners in Poland 


during the Nazi occupation. To call the account chilling is to say 
almost nothing. I told him with all due seriousness that he had to 
read the book as if it really happened, and more, as if he and the 
people he knew were capable of the same heinous acts. It was time 
for him to grow up. We had established a very solid rapport by this 
time, and when I told him that his rose-colored view of the world 
was presenting him with danger sufficient to destroy his life he took 
me seriously. The next time I saw him, a week later, he had finished 
the book. His face had hardened. He looked older and wiser. I had 
seen this happen frequently in my clinical practice when people 
incorporated the darker parts of themselves, instead of—let us say— 
compartmentalizing them. They no longer had the habitual look of 
deer caught in the headlights. They looked like people from whom 
decisions emanated, rather than people to whom things merely 
happened. Then I asked him to read The Rape of Nanking,” about 
Japanese atrocities in China in 1937. It is a horrifying book. The 
woman who wrote it committed suicide. My client read that, too, 
and we talked about it. He emerged sadder, but wiser. His nighttime 
symptoms, however, did not abate. 

Nonetheless, his comments about adults-as-angels, claims to 
have compartmentalized his knowledge of evil, and the presence of 
the inexplicable convulsions had started some wheels turning in the 
far recesses of my brain. Many years earlier, I had another client (a 
young woman, as is more typically the case) who had hysterical 
epilepsy—a classic case of Freudian hysteria, where bodily 
symptoms were expressing psychological problems. She had been 
raised in the rural Midwest, in a very repressed, Victorian-like 
Christian fundamentalist atmosphere. She had one of her “seizures” 
in my office—full grand mal. The sight of it left me cold. I watched 
impassively as she thrashed and convulsed violently for several 
minutes, eyes rolled back. I did not worry. I did not feel sorry for 
her. I did not feel anything. I thought, “Why is this not affecting 
me? My client is having, by all evidence, a serious convulsive 
episode.” I did not call an ambulance. When she came out of it and 
sat back down, dazed, I told her that I had responded to her seizure 
neither physically nor emotionally as if it were real, despite its 


otherwise fully credible manifestation. Previously, after pulling 
similar stunts (consciously? unconsciously? some mixture of the 
two?), she had barely skirted consignment to a psychiatric ward. She 
had also risked a diagnosis of psychosis and prescription for the 
medication accompanying that. We had some very serious talks 
about what she was doing. I let her know that I did not buy her 
epilepsy—that I had experienced it as false, even though it seemed 
quite real to her. (She had been tested, by the way, for epilepsy, and 
the results had come back equivocal.) 

So, she was plausibly someone who “somatized,” or physically 
represented their psychological symptoms. Freud noted that such 
somatization was often symbolic—that the manner in which the 
physical disability or oddity manifested had some meaningful 
relationship with the trauma that had precipitated it. Her hysterical 
epilepsy appeared to originate in her ambivalence and ignorance 
about sex, a substantial degree of childish immaturity, and some 
dangerous game-playing on her part. We made a lot of progress in 
our discussions. She was far from unintelligent, and the wiser part 
of her prevailed. Her seizures came to an end, along with the equally 
dangerous drama. Even better, she avoided the psych ward and 
continued with her university career. In any case, I learned then 
that Freudian hysterics existed, because I had just worked with one. 

I began to hypothesize that my current client was suffering, in a 
similar manner, from a somatization disorder. I knew about the 
fight that had terminated his last relationship, just before the onset 
of his symptoms. Perhaps his strange movements were somehow 
associated with that event? I also knew from his own account that 
he compartmentalized—that he put things in a corner of his mind 
where he would not think about them again. I did not have much 
experience with hypnosis but knew both that people capable of 
compartmentalization tended to be highly hypnotizable, and that 
hypnosis had been used with some success (albeit many years ago) 
with somatization disorders. Freud used hypnosis to treat his 
hysterical clients, who were apparently quite numerous during the 
Victorian period, at least in the upper class, fixated as they were on 


the sexual, the theatrical, and the dramatic.® So, I thought I might 
try hypnosis to treat my client. 

Now, I often used guided relaxation techniques on my clients, 
sitting them comfortably in their armchair in my office, asking them 
to focus on different parts of their body, from the soles of their feet, 
step by step up their legs and torso, with a brief detour down their 
arms, to the top of their head, focusing on their breathing and 
relaxing. After seven or eight minutes of the relaxation instructions, 
I would count back from ten to one, requesting after each count or 
two that they relax more deeply. It was a reasonably good, quick 
treatment for agitation, anxiety, and insomnia. I decided to start this 
way, because hypnosis employs essentially the same technique, 
adding questions about past trauma or other relevant issues once 
relaxation had been established. Its effectiveness varies 
substantially from person to person.°* (That is why stage performers 
who use hypnosis on audience members will bring twenty people to 
the front of the theater, run through the initial hypnotic 
suggestions, and then retain only the few who are obviously 
responsive.) In any case, I told my client that I thought hypnotizing 
him and talking about the night he fought with his boyfriend might 
be useful. I told him why (suggesting that his nighttime movements 
might be associated with that event). Then I told him exactly how 
we were going to do it, and that he was free to refuse or agree. I 
would stop whenever he asked me to, if he asked; and he would 
remember everything when we were finished. 

He agreed to try, so I began: “Sit comfortably in your chair. Place 
your hands on the arms of the chair or in your lap—wherever you 
are most comfortable. Close your eyes. Listen carefully to the noises 
that you hear in the world around you, and then turn your attention 
inward to your breathing. Breathe in deeply. ... Hold it.... Breathe 
out. Move your attention down your body from your breathing to 
your thighs, and lower legs, and feet. Let your feet rest heavily on 
the floor. Pay attention to your toes, and the soles of your feet, and 
your ankles, and remember to breathe slowly, regularly, and deeply. 
Let all the tension flow out of your feet. Do not forget to breathe 


slowly, regularly, and deeply. Pay attention to your calves, and your 
shins...” and so on, up the whole body. Usually. 

My client fell spontaneously into a deep hypnotic trance before I 
got past his feet. His head lolled heavily. I asked if he could hear me. 
“Yes,” he said, barely audibly. I had to advance my chair and put my 
ear within inches of his mouth to make out what he was saying. I 
asked him if he knew where he was. “In your office,” he said. That 
was good. I said, “We are returning to the time when you had a fight 
with your boyfriend, before you moved out. Tell me what 
happened.” He said, “We had just returned to our apartment. We 
had both been drinking. We were fighting about finances and our 
future at the bar. We both got angry. We walked through the 
doorway of our house—there.” He half gestured with his arm, 
although it was still mostly limp, like the rest of his body. I was 
watching his eyes dart back and forth, like those of someone in 
REM sleep, under three-quarter-closed lids. “I was walking 
backward. We were moving toward the living room. I pushed him. 
Then he pushed me back. I pushed him again. He pushed me 
backward over our coffee table and onto the floor. He picked up our 
floor lamp and held it over his head. I looked directly into his eyes. I 
had never seen an expression so hostile. I curled into a ball and 
crossed my hands over my face to protect myself.” He said all this 
very slowly, gesturing awkwardly and minimally all the while, 
pointing as if toward the area in the apartment he was imagining. It 
was uncannily as if he were reliving the experience in real time. I 
glanced at the clock. The explanation, preparation, relaxation, and 
the slow recounting had taken us up to the one-hour mark—our 
normal session duration. I said, “I do not want to push you too far. 
We are running out of time. When you are ready, and comfortable, 
you might open your eyes and wake up fully. We could continue 
next week.” But he did not respond. His head continued to loll 
forward, and his eyes kept moving. I called his name. No change. 

This worried me, quite frankly. I had never heard of someone 
failing to emerge from a trance when requested. I was not sure what 
to do. Fortunately, however, he was the last client I was seeing that 
evening, so I had some time. I thought, “Well, he is in a deep trance 


and truly immersed in this account. Maybe he needs to tell the 
whole story. Let us continue and see what happens. When he is 
finished with his account, I will try to bring him around again.” I 
went out to the hallway to speak with his waiting aunt, and 
informed her that we required a bit more time. I returned to my 
office and sat back down, near him as before. I said, “What 
happened then?” He replied, “The expression on his face—I had 
never seen someone look like that before. I was forced to realize 
then that my boyfriend could want to hurt me; that one person— 
even if adult—could truly desire to bring harm to another. It was the 
first time I truly learned that such events were possible.” He began 
to weep, but continued his account: “I knocked his feet from under 
him, got up, and started running. He chased me out of the living 
room, down the hallway of our house, and through the front door. I 
could run faster, and got ahead of him. It was about four in the 
morning. It was still dark. I was terrified. I got far enough ahead of 
him to hide behind some nearby cars. He could not find me. I 
watched him looking for a long while. Then he gave up and turned 
around.” He was sobbing openly by this point. “When I was sure he 
was gone, I went to my mother’s place and stayed there. I could not 
believe what had happened. He might have killed me, and he was 
going to do it on purpose. I couldn’t stand it. I pushed it from my 
mind and tried never to think about it again.” 

He fell silent. I called his name. He responded. I asked him, “Do 
you know that you are in my office and sitting in the chair you 
usually occupy?” He nodded. “Are you finished telling me your 
story?” He replied in the affirmative. I said, “You did well. It was 
very brave of you to go through all that. Are you ready to open your 
eyes?” He said that he was. I said, “Take your time. When you are 
ready, come back fully awake, slowly. You are going to feel relaxed 
and well. You will remember everything you just told me and 
everything that happened here.” He nodded. A few moments later 
he opened his eyes. I asked him what had happened—what he 
remembered. He briefly recounted the evening’s events, including 
our initial discussion about hypnosis. I then called in his aunt and 
told her that he needed to rest at home, with someone in 


attendance, because the session had been intense. Adults were not 
angels, and people could not only hurt each other—they could desire 
that hurt with all their heart. But my client did not know what to do 
with such knowledge, sheltered as he was, deluded as he was by his 
parents—blind as he allowed himself to remain with his 
“compartmentalization.” This did not stop the inarticulate elements 
of his being from endeavoring to dramatically represent and bring 
toward consciousness both the fact of intended harm and 
everything more broadly evil such intent implied. He found himself 
compelled to duplicate precisely the defensive bodily movements he 
had made to during the fight with his boyfriend. 

The next week, my client did not show up for his session. I 
thought “Oh, God. Maybe I did him some serious damage.” 
However, he arrived on time the next week. He apologized for 
missing the last session, but said that he had become extremely 
upset and was in consequence too scrambled to attend or even to 
contact me. I asked why. He said, “The day after we last met, I was 
sitting in a restaurant downtown, and I saw my old boyfriend!” It 
was an uncanny coincidence. “It really rattled me, you know,” he 
continued, “but nothing came of it, and I calmed down in a day or 
two. And guess what?” “What?” I said. “I only had convulsions one 
night this week! And they only lasted a few minutes!” I said, “That is 
great! That is really great! What a relief! What do you think 
changed?” He said, “What really got to me in that fight was not our 
disagreement about what future we wanted. It was not the physical 
contact—the pushing and shoving. It was the fact that he truly 
wished me harm. I could see it in his face. His look truly terrified 
me. I could not handle it. But I can understand it better now.” 

I asked him if I could hypnotize him again. “You are obviously 
better,” I said, “but I want to make sure that we got everything.” He 
agreed, and we began. He fell into a trance just as easily. But this 
time, he condensed the story. He got through the whole account in 
fifteen minutes, as opposed to the ninety required previously. He 
had extracted what was important: the fact that he was in danger; 
the fact that someone wanted to hurt him; the fact that he had 
defended himself successfully—the fact that the world was a place 


inhabited by demons, so to speak, as well as angels. When I asked 
him to come out of the trance, in the same way I had before, he 
opened his eyes almost immediately, and was calm and fully aware. 

The change in his condition was remarkable. The next week, he 
said that his symptoms had disappeared completely. No more 
convulsions—and no more belief in the untarnished goodness of 
mankind. He had grown up and faced the reality of his own 
experience, as well as the nature of the world. It was something to 
see. Conscious acceptance of the presence of malevolence cured him 
of years of suffering. He now understood and admitted enough of 
the potential dangers that surrounded him to make his way in 
reasonable safety through the world. It was no longer necessary for 
what he had learned but refused to acknowledge to force itself upon 
him in its dramatic, embodied manner. He made what he now knew 
part of his personality—part of the map that would guide him 
henceforth in his actions—and freed himself from the ghosts that 
possessed him. 


UNCOMPREHENDED MALEVOLENCE 


I had another client, a young man who was terribly bullied in his 
first year of vocational college. When he first came to see me, he 
could barely talk, and was taking a high dose of antipsychotic 
medication. When he sat in the chair in front of the desk in my 
office, he would twist his head and shoulders back and forth in a 
very abnormal and mechanical manner. When I asked him what he 
was doing, he told me that he was trying to make the shapes go 
away. Apparently, he could perceive geometric images of some kind 
in front of him, and felt compelled to manipulate them. I never did 
understand exactly what that signified, except that he was in a world 
of his own. 

I spent several months working with him, and did it in a more 
structured manner than previously—having, in the interim, 
developed the tools to do so. This client could only communicate a 
little at the beginning of our work together, but that was enough to 


start the ball rolling. Some girl at the college had developed a crush 
on him. He informed her that her romantic interest was not 
reciprocated. She became exceedingly vindictive, and set out to 
make his life hell. She spread rumors about his sexual habits. She 
encouraged some of her male friends to physically threaten him at 
school. She had people on hand to humiliate him constantly and 
unmercifully in transit to and from campus. Noting his distress, his 
parents alerted the school, but nothing was done to stop the 
ongoing torment. Unable or unwilling to tolerate the mounting peer 
pressure, the friends he had only recently made began to avoid and 
then entirely abandoned him. He began to break down, and as his 
behavior became stranger, his outcast status was cemented into 
place. And he broke. 

I asked him to let me know exactly what happened—and to reach 
a long way back while formulating his answer. I wanted to 
understand what, if anything, made him vulnerable to the situation 
he found himself in, and what exactly had happened when he was 
being tormented by his spurned admirer. And I structured this so 
that he could write, as well as talk (more accurately, so that he could 
talk about what he was writing). My colleagues and I had developed 
an online writing exercise* to provide some helpful structure for 
those delving into and making sense of their past. I asked my young 
client to try it. Because he was too impaired in his motivation and 
his thoughts to complete the process at home, I had him do his 
writing in my office. I set him at my computer and asked him to 
read each question in the exercise aloud to me before writing his 
answer, and then to read that aloud as well. If I failed to understand 
something he had written or felt that more detail was required, I 
suggested he clarify the issues at hand with more writing and read 
me his revisions. 

The exercise opened by asking him to break his life into key 
epochs—sections of his autobiographical past that lent themselves 
naturally to categorization as a unit or theme. That might be, say, 
age two through kindergarten, elementary school, junior high, high 
school, college, etc.—although some people are inclined, particularly 
as they get older, to group their experiences according to the various 


relationships of which they were a member. After he subdivided his 
past in the manner he chose, the exercise then asked him to identify 
key experiences during each of those epochs: events that he 
believed, in retrospect, shaped him as a person, for better or worse. 
Obviously, events of the latter type are likely to be marked in 
memory by negative emotions such as anxiety, anger, or the desire 
for revenge—and, perhaps, by a strong tendency to avoid 
remembering and considering altogether. 

My client broke his life into the epochs that seemed relevant to 
him, and then identified the key events, both positive and negative, 
characterizing each period. Next, he analyzed them causally, coming 
to understand why some things had gone well, while others had 
deteriorated so terribly. He concentrated most intensely on what 
gave rise to the most disturbing events of the past—assessing 
particulars of his own behavior, motivations of other people, and 
characteristics of time and place. He considered what effects those 
produced, for better and worse (because we can learn things from 
difficult experiences), and thought through what might have 
happened or been done differently. The consequence of all this, at 
least in principle, was the mining of past experiences for their true 
perceptual and behavioral significance, and an update of his 
autobiographical map. 

As his account progressed from day care through public schooling 
—he had divided his life into sections defined by school grade—he 
became increasingly articulate. Recollecting his life was putting him 
back together. As he wrote, read what he wrote, and answered the 
questions I put to him while listening, his account of the past 
became more detailed and his understanding of it deeper. We 
discussed the undesirable things that children do to each other, and 
that led us to the topic of malevolence and evil—in the adult world, 
as well. He was very naive about this. He expressed the belief that 
people were universally good (even though he had experience to the 
contrary). He had no theory of motivation for destruction, cruelty, 
and the desire for mayhem. 

We walked through his life, developing a particularly detailed 
account of everything he had suffered at the hands of his tormentor. 


He became sophisticated enough to articulate some initial 
understanding of her motivations. She had been spurned and was, 
in consequence, hurt, embarrassed, and angry. He had not realized 
either how much impact his rejection might produce or how much 
impact rejection can have on people in general. He did not seem to 
understand, furthermore, that he had the right to defend himself. 
We talked about what he could have done differently, or might do 
differently in the future, to protect himself. He realized that he had 
taken far too much insult at school without reaching out for help. 
He could have let the appropriate administrative staff at the college 
know what was going on. He could have confronted his tormentor 
directly, publicly, earlier in the abuse, and demanded that she stop. 
He could have let his classmates know that the only reason he was 
being tormented was because he had refused a date, and that she 
was So fragile and brittle that she could not handle the rejection and 
was inventing lies for revenge. In the extreme, he could have had 
her charged with criminal harassment and defamatory libel. None of 
these strategies would have been sure to work, but they would have 
been worth trying, and were certainly justified and necessary under 
the circumstances. 

As he worked through the memories of his recent month at 
college, his psychotic symptoms receded dramatically. At every 
session he attended, he was more clearheaded. He stopped 
manifesting his strange behaviors. He enrolled in summer school 
and finished his remaining coursework. It was a near-miraculous 
recovery. 


POTENTIAL INTO ACTUALITY 


It is far from uncommon for people to worry, sometimes 
unbearably, about what lies ahead of them. That worry is a both a 
consequence of and an investigation into the multiple pathways 
extending from now into the future. Concerns line themselves up, 
often involuntarily, for consideration: troublesome issues at work, 
problems with friends and loved ones, practical issues of economic 


and material survival. Each concern requires multiple decisions: 
What problems should be solved? In what order should action 
proceed? What strategy should be employed? All of this requires 
something like choice—free choice, free will. And the choice to act 
seems voluntary; it is a simple thing (although very psychologically 
unsatisfying) to succumb to paralysis of will. 

To decide, by contrast, voluntarily and freely, is difficult and 
demanding. It feels nothing like the automatic processes of reflexive 
or habitual pathways moving us thoughtlessly forward. We do not 
appear to ourselves to be driven by the past, in some fundamentally 
deterministic manner, like a mechanical clock in which the spring 
drives the gears that turn the hands and tell the time. Instead, when 
we decide, we actively confront the future. We seem destined to face 
something akin to unformed potential and to determine what will 
emerge as the present—and then the past. 

We literally make the world what it is, from the many things we 
perceive it could be. Doing so is perhaps the primary fact of our 
being, and perhaps of Being itself. We face a multitude of prospects 
—of manifold realities, each almost tangible—and by choosing one 
pathway rather than another, reduce that multitude to the singular 
actuality of reality. In doing so, we bring the world from becoming 
into Being. This is the most profound of mysteries. What is that 
potential that confronts us? And what constitutes our strange ability 
to shape that possibility, and to make what is real and concrete from 
what begins, in some sense, as the merely imaginary? 

There is something else of perhaps equal import allied with this, 
impossible as that might seem, given the very unlikeliness of the 
role we appear to play in the shaping of reality. Not only do our 
choices play a determining role in transforming the multiplicity of 
the future into the actuality of the present, but—more specifically— 
the ethics of our choices play that role. Actions based upon the 
desire to take responsibility; to make things better; to avoid 
temptation and face what we would rather avoid; to act voluntarily, 
courageously, and truthfully—these make what comes into Being 
much better, in all ways, for ourselves and for others, than what 
arises as a consequence of avoidance, resentment, the search for 


revenge, or the desire for mayhem. This means that if we act 
ethically, in the deepest and most universal of senses, then the 
tangible reality that emerges from the potential we face will be good 
instead of dreadful—or at least as good as we can make it. 

Everyone seems to know this. We are universally tormented by 
our consciences for what we know we should have done yet did not 
do. We are tormented equally by what we did but know we should 
not have done. Is this not a universal experience? Can anyone 
escape the pangs of conscience at four o’clock in the morning after 
acting immorally or destructively, or failing to act when action was 
necessary? And what is the source for that inescapable conscience? 
If we were the source of our own values and masters of our own 
houses, then we could act or fail to act as we choose and not suffer 
the pangs of regret, sorrow, and shame. But I have never met 
anyone who could manage that. Even the most psychopathic of 
people seemed motivated at least to mask their malfeasance with a 
layer of lies (with the depth of that layer precisely proportionate to 
the severity of the impropriety in question). Even the most 
malevolent, it appears, must find justification for his or her evil. 

If we fail to hold ourselves to that standard of responsibility, then 
other people regard us as lacking in ethics and integrity. And it does 
not end there. Just as we hold people (including ourselves) 
accountable for the wrongs they have done, or the good they have 
failed to do, we also believe (or at least act out the proposition) that 
someone who has made a good decision freely, deserves whatever 
benefit might come of that decision. It is for that reason that we 
believe each person should justly receive the fruit of their honest 
and voluntary labor. There seems something natural and inevitable 
about such judgments; something at work within them that is 
universal and inescapable, psychologically and socially. What all 
this means is that everyone—child, adult, self, others—will rebel 
against being treated as a cog in a wheel, incapable of choice and 
devoid of freedom, and (similarly) that it is practically impossible to 
establish a positive relationship with any other (or even our private 
selves) without that attribution of personal agency, free will, and 
responsibility. 


THE WORD AS SAVIOR 


The twin ideas that we all are, as sovereign individuals, first, 
voluntarily participating in the act of creation itself and, second, 
determining the quality of that creation with the ethics of our 
choices finds reflection in myriad manners within our relationships, 
private and public. These ideas are also encapsulated and 
represented in the narratives, the fundamental narratives, that sit at 
the base of our culture. These stories—whatever their ultimate 
metaphysical significance—are at least in part a consequence of our 
watching ourselves act across eons of human history, and distilling 
from that watching the essential patterns of our actions. We are 
cartographers, makers of maps; geographers, concerned with the 
layout of the land. But we are also, more precisely and accurately, 
charters of courses, sailors and explorers. We recall the places we 
started from, the positions we occupied when our stories began. We 
remember the pitfalls and successes of the past so that we can avoid 
the former and repeat the latter. To do so, we need to know where 
we have been, where we currently are, and in what direction we are 
headed. We reduce that account to its causal structure: we need to 
know what happened and why, and we need to know it as simply 
and practically as possible. 

It is for such reasons we are so captivated by people who can tell 
a story—who can share their experiences concisely and precisely, 
and who get to the point. That point—the moral of the story—is 
what they learned about who and where they were or are, and where 
they are going and why. Such information is irresistible to us all. It 
is how (and why) we derive wisdom from the risks taken by those 
before us, and who lived to tell the story: “This is what life was like 
then. This is what we wanted, and why. This is what we envisioned, 
and how we strategized, planned, and then acted. Sometimes, we 
succeeded and realized our aims. But too often (and this is what is 
crucial to a great story): here is how what we did not expect 
occurred, here is how we were knocked off the path, here are the 
tragedies we encountered and the mistakes we made—and here is 
how we put the world back together (or failed to do so).” We value 


such stories particularly if they have attained the pinnacle of 
generalizability, representing heroic battles with the unknown, as 
such, or the dissolution of tyrannical order into revivifying chaos 
and the (re)establishment of benevolent society.*° This can be seen 
everywhere that people tell and listen avidly to stories: and that is 
literally everywhere.* 

The most fundamental stories of the West are to be found, for 
better or worse, in the biblical corpus. That collection of ancient and 
eminently influential books opens with God Himself, in His 
Fatherly guise, portrayed as the ordered entity who confronts chaos 
and creates habitable order in consequence: 


And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness 
was upon the face of the deep. And the Spirit of God 
moved upon the face of the waters. (Genesis 1:2) 


This formlessness, void, darkness, and water (a confusing 
conglomeration of attributes) is a consequence of the translation of 
a biblical Hebrew phrase, tohu wa-bohu (4n11,3nn), made up of two 
words, tohuw and bohuw. Tohuw is even more complicated than 
mere formlessness, etc.; it also means “that which is laid waste,” 
“vanity” (which might be something likely to be laid to waste, 
psychologically speaking), and “desert” (which is uninhabitable and 
void).+* It is also associated with another Hebrew word, tehom ( 
DinNN), which is the source of the phrase “the deep.” Tehom, in turn, 
means “the abyss,” and is associated with an earlier Sumerian term, 
Tiamat,** who is the great mother goddess/dragon (and denizen of 
salt water) who creates the world with her consort, Apsu, in the 
Mesopotamian creation myth Enuma Elish. 

According to the Genesis account, there exists something—a 
potential, let us say, associated symbolically with the abyss, with the 
oceanic depths—but also with desert, dragons, 
maternality/matriarchy, emptiness, formlessness, and darkness.** 
This is all the attempt of poetry and metaphor to give initial, 
ordered, conceptual form to the formless. The abyss is what 


terrifies, what is at the end of the earth, what we gaze upon when 
contemplating our mortality and fragility, and what devours hope. 
Water is depth and the source of life itself. The desert is a place of 
abandonment, isolation, and loneliness, as well as the interregnum 
between tyranny and the promised land. The dragon is the ancient 
image of the predator as such—the fire-breathing tree-cat-snake- 
bird*»—eternally lurking in the forest beyond the familiar confines 
of tribe and village. It is as well the Leviathan hidden in the salt 
water, the depths—the terrible monster Jehovah refers to 
overcoming in Job 41:25—34 and in many other places in the Old 
Testament accounts.** 

God has an attribute, or an alternative Person, or a faculty, or a 
tool that aids Him or that He relies on when confronting possibility 
and the void. That is the Word, from the Christian perspective—but 
certainly the capacity for speech, regardless of religious framework, 
Jewish or Christian. There is a continual insistence in Genesis on 
the importance of speech. The act of creation on each day begins 
with the phrase “and God said” (with additional emphasis on the act 
of naming: “and God called”). The seven days of creation begin: 


And God said, Let there be light: and there was light. 
And God saw the light, that it was good: and God 
divided the light from the darkness. 
And God called the light Day, and the darkness he 
called Night. And the evening and the morning were the 
first day. (Genesis 1:3-5) 


Almost immediately after God first reveals Himself, His creative 
actions, and the initial creation (thus, almost instantly after we are 
introduced to Him), He creates human beings. Three features of 
that creation stand forth, in addition to its immediacy: the 
insistence that mankind is to have dominion* over the rest of 
creation; the shocking and incomprehensibly modern and 
egalitarian insistence that God created man and woman equally in 
His own image (stated twice; Genesis 1:27); and the equally unlikely 


and miraculous insistence that the creation of humanity was, like 
the rest of the Creation, good. If God is, above all, as He is initially 
described, that implies that the men and women created in His 
image share with Him something of import—or, more to the point, 
they share an analogous destiny, necessity, or responsibility. 

The Word—the tool God uses to transform the depths of potential 
—is truthful speech. It appears necessarily allied, however, with the 
courage to confront unrealized possibility in all its awful potential, 
so that reality itself may be brought forth. Perhaps both this Truth 
and Courage must finally be subsumed, in turn, under the broader 
principle of Love—love for Being itself, despite its fragility, tyranny, 
and betrayal; love that has as its aim what is best for the best in 
everything. It is that combination of Truth, Courage, and Love 
comprising the Ideal, whose active incarnation in each individual 
does in fact take the potential of the future and make the best of it. 
And who would deny this? No one teaches a beloved son to cringe in 
terror and cowardice from what confronts him. No one teaches a 
beloved daughter that deceit will set the world right, and that 
whatever works expediently is to be practiced, honored, and 
mimicked. And no one tells anyone he or she cares for that the 
proper response to Being is hatred and the desire to produce pain, 
suffering, mayhem, and catastrophe. Thus, it can be assumed from 
analysis of our own behavior that we know the difference between 
the pathway of good and the pathway of evil, and that we believe 
above all (despite our conscious resistance and prideful argument) 
in the existence of both. But there is yet more: the insistence of God 
on the goodness of creation reflected the fact that Truth, Courage, 
and Love were united in His creative action. Thus, there is an ethical 
claim deeply embedded in the Genesis account of creation: 
everything that emerges from the realm of possibility in the act of 
creation (arguably, either divine or human) is good insofar as the 
motive for its creation is good. I do not believe there is a more 
daring argument in all of philosophy or in theology than this: To 
believe this, to act it out, is the fundamental act of faith. 

There is an argument presented much later in the biblical 
narrative, in the New Testament. Christ says the following words to 


His followers. It is a commentary on the potential for completing 
your life, for reclaiming what you have lost—or even discovering 
what you did not know was there: 


And I say unto you, Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, 
and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you. 

For every one that asketh receiveth; and he that 
seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be 
opened. 

If a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, 
will he give him a stone? or if he ask a fish, will he fora 
fish give him a serpent? 

Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer him a scorpion? 

If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto 
your children: how much more shall your heavenly Father 
give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? (Luke 11:9—13) 


This is not a casual statement. It is not naive. It is not a matter of 
asking for a present, unearned. God is no granter of casual wishes.* 
It is a matter, first, of truly Asking. This means being willing to let 
go of anything and everything that is not in keeping with the desire. 
Otherwise there is no Asking. There is only an immature and too- 
often resentful whim and wish: “Oh, that I could have what I want, 
without doing what is necessary.” That will not suffice. So, to ask, 
seek, and knock is to do everything required to gather what has 
been left unfinished and to complete it, now. And to ask, seek, and 
knock is, as well, to determine what must be asked for. And that has 
to be something that is worthy of God. Why else would it be 
granted? How else could it possibly be granted? 

Imagine for a moment you have been given all you need. There is 
possibility within you, waiting for the proper demand to release 
itself. There is all that is outside of you, waiting to inform and teach 
you. But all of it is necessary—the good, bad, and unbearable. You 
know that when something does not go well, you should analyze the 
problem, resolve it, apologize, repent, and transform. An unsolved 


problem seldom sits there, in stasis. It grows new heads, like a 
hydra. One lie—one act of avoidance—breeds the necessity for more. 
One act of self-deception generates the requirement to buttress that 
self-deceptive belief with new delusions. One devastated 
relationship, unaddressed, damages your reputation—damages your 
faith in yourself, equally—and decreases the probability of a new 
and better relationship. Thus, your refusal or even inability to come 
to terms with the errors of the past expands the source of such error 
—expands the unknown that surrounds you, transforms that 
unknown into something increasingly predatory. 

And, while that is happening, you get weaker. You are less than 
you could be because you did not change. You did not become who 
you could have become as a consequence of that change—and 
worse: you have now taught yourself, by your own example, that 
such turning away is acceptable, and you are therefore more likely 
to commit the same error in the future. And what you failed to face 
is now larger. This is not the kind of causal process, the kind of 
positive feedback loop, that you want to find yourself trapped 
within. So, you must confess, at least to yourself, and repent, at 
least within yourself, and you must change, because you were 
wrong. And you must humbly ask, and knock, and seek. And that is 
the great barrier to the enlightenment of which we are all capable in 
principle. This is not to claim that the courage necessary to confront 
the full horrors of life is easy to muster. But the alternative is worse. 

It is our destiny to transform chaos into order. If the past has not 
been ordered, the chaos it still constitutes haunts us. There is 
information—vital information—resting in the memories that affect 
us negatively. It is as if part of the personality is still lying latent, 
out in the world, making itself manifest only in emotional 
disruption. What is traumatic but remains inexplicable indicates 
that the map of the world that guides our navigation is insufficient 
in some vital manner. It is necessary to understand the negative 
well enough so that it can be circumvented as we move into the 
future if we do not wish to remain tormented by the past. And it is 
not the expression of emotion associated with unpleasant events 
that has curative power. It is the development of a sophisticated 


causal theory: Why was IJ at risk? What was it about the world that 
made it dangerous? What was I doing or not doing to contribute to 
my vulnerability? How can I change the value hierarchy I inhabit to 
take the negative into account so that I can see and understand it? 
How much of my old map do I have to let crumble and burn—with 
all the pain dying tissue produces—before I can change enough to 
take my full range of experience into account? Do I have the faith to 
step beyond what should and must die and let my new and wiser 
personality emerge? To some great degree, we are our assumptions. 
They structure the world for us. When basic axioms of faith are 
challenged (“People are basically good”), the foundation shakes and 
the walls crumble. We have every reason to avoid facing the bitter 
truth. But making what is—and what was—clear and fully 
comprehended can only protect us. If you are suffering from 
memories that will not stop tormenting you, there is possibility— 
possibility that could be your very salvation—waiting there to be 
discovered. 

If old memories still upset you, write them down carefully and 
completely.

RULE X 


PLAN AND WORK DILIGENTLY TO MAINTAIN THE 
ROMANCE IN YOUR RELATIONSHIP 


THE UNBEARABLE DATE 


I am not a couples’ therapist. But sometimes, when I see a client, it 
becomes necessary to include his or her intimate partner in one or 
more sessions. I do that only when directly asked. I also make it 
clear that the couple should seek out a marital counseling specialist 
if that is their central goal. However, if one of the primary problems 
my client is addressing is dissatisfaction in the marriage, it is often 
counterproductive to speak with only one member of the couple. 
Finally, it is often the case (and no wonder, really) that the partner 
in question does not trust his or her better half’s therapist—me— 
and a meeting with all three of us can go a long way toward 
rectifying that. 

Prior to meeting with a couple, I will have discussed some basic 
rules for relationship improvement with my client. Let us say he or 
she has decided to make some time for romance: four hours a week 
or something like that (I am speaking here of adults, with their full 
share of responsibilities). Maybe that much can be managed. Maybe 
even more is possible. But there is not that much time in seven 
days, and the situation must be set up correctly and carefully. And 
when all this is first practiced—all this conscious negotiation and 
enactment—it is going to be done badly and stupidly, with all the 
attendant pain, resentment, and vengefulness. And then such 


negative emotion can be nursed and the relationship damaged— 
sometimes permanently. 

Perhaps my client and his or her partner have become estranged 
from one another over several years when we first start to discuss 
their situation. They are not happy, and they hate me—maybe even 
more than they hate each other. They sit there, distant, arms 
crossed and eyes rolling (hopefully not the latter: that is a bad 
sign*). Neither will give an inch. I ask them when they last did 
something romantic together; when they last went out together for 
a date. They laugh ruefully, if things have not gone too far, or scoff 
outright. I suggest, nonetheless, that they try going out with each 
other; or more, that they start making dates a regular practice. The 
former suggestion is bad enough; the second, intolerable. They 
indicate: “We are not going on any damn dates. We dated before we 
got married, when it was appropriate. Besides, all we will do is 
fight.” 

And here is my take on that angry, bitter, and shallow response: 
“This is the theory you are putting forth: You are never going to 
accompany each other on another date in your entire married life. 
(So much for romance and intimacy.) Instead, you are just going to 
give that up. Why not, instead, risk the time? Take each other 
somewhere nice. Dare to put your arm around your partner, or your 
hand on a knee (and not your own, either). I know you are angry 
with each other, and probably for good reason. I have met both of 
you: I understand why you both feel that way :-). But just try it. You 
do not have to like it. You do not have to expect to be good at it, or 
give up your anger, or have a good time. You just have to tolerate it.” 

They both leave incensed at me for suggesting such an irritating 
idea. But they agree grudgingly, and at their next session inform me: 
“It happened just as we told you: we had an absolutely wretched 
time. We fought before we went out, while we were out, and again, 
when we returned home. We are certainly not going to risk a date 
again.” They often evince a certain pride at reaching such a 
conclusion, as both had generally decided ahead of time that the 
whole idea was pointless. So, I ask: “That is the plan, is it? You are 
going to be married for sixty years. You put a small amount of 


begrudging effort into having one date. You were already not getting 
along, so there was a negligible probability you were going to take 
any pleasure in it. Besides that, irritated at me as you were for my 
childish suggestion, you were both motivated to make it go horribly, 
just as it did. So, you are done with it. And now you have decided 
that this is how you are going to conduct yourselves across the 
decades you have promised each other: with spite and bitterness 
instead of mutual regard? 

“Let us try thinking about it this way, instead: Neither of you 
have any skill at dating. One attempt is therefore going to be 
insufficient. Maybe you need fifteen dates—or forty—because you 
have lost the knack, need the practice, and must develop the habit 
and goodwill. Perhaps neither of you are very romantic to begin 
with; or if you were once, those days have long gone. This is a skill 
you must learn, not an unearned gift from Cupid.” 

Assume you are married—or the equivalent. Assume, as well, that 
you have, or could have, a romantic interlude twice a week. It may 
be less; it may be more: but we will do the arithmetic for twice 
weekly. That is a hundred times a year. Let us imagine that you are 
going to be married thirty more years. Thirty times one hundred is 
three thousand times. Is there not some possibility that you could 
devote a fraction of all that time to perfecting your technique, 
seduction, communication, and lovemaking? What does it matter, 
therefore, if you have fifteen miserable dates before managing one 
that verges on acceptable? That is fifteen times out of a possible 
three thousand. That is half a percent of the romantic time you 
could possibly spend together. Maybe you could dare even more to 
determine if things could be set right between you. Why would you 
possibly assume that something as complex as maintaining a 
marriage could be managed without commitment, practice, and 
effort? 

“So maybe the first date is wretched and horrible. You never want 
to repeat it but you do, because you would rather save your 
marriage than quit outright. And maybe the next one is five percent 
better. And maybe after some repeated attempts you remember for 
at least a brief moment why you once liked the person you married. 


Perhaps you manage something a little more exciting than putting 
your arm around him or her, and perhaps receive a bit of a response 
from someone who actually cares for you somewhere in their now 
cold and shriveled heart. And if you are in it for the long run, as 
indicated by the original marital vows, perhaps you will put in the 
time to get it right.” 

And maybe the couple has enough sense to do the arithmetic and 
contemplate all that wasted time, as well as the bitterness, 
resentment, and deadness of life without romance, and they agree 
to go on another date, or two, or three, or ten—and by the tenth 
session they come to see me, smiling, and tell me they had a pretty 
good time. And then we have an even more serious discussion about 
just what it takes to maintain love and respect, and invoke desire 
and response. How do you find the mystery in the other person over 
the long run? Can you muster up the will and the romantic 
imagination and the playfulness to manage that, each time you are 
together intimately, for the next three thousand occasions? That is 
going to require some thoughtful effort. 

For each person is in truth an unfathomable enigma. With care, 
you might keep rediscovering, in the person you have chosen, 
enough residual mystery to maintain the spirit that first brought 
you together. With care, you can avoid stowing each other away in a 
conveniently sized box, punishment at hand should either of you 
dare to emerge, and contempt for the consequent predictability you 
both now face lurking not so far beneath the surface. If you are 
fortunate, you might rekindle that glimpse you had when you first 
were attracted to each other, of what your life could be like if you 
were better people than you are. That is what happens two people 
fall under the spell of love. For a while, both become better than 
they were, and see that, but then that magic fades away. Both 
receive that experience as a gift. Both have their eyes open and can 
see what is visible to no one else. Such love is a glimpse of what 
could be, if the relationship remained true. It is delivered as a gift 
initially, from fate, but requires tremendous effort to realize and 
maintain. And once that is understood, the goal is clear. 


BEDROCK 


The sexual aspect of a relationship can often tell us a great deal 
about the whole, but not always. I have known couples who fought 
like proverbial cats and dogs and who had a wildly successful sex 
life (at least in the short term), and other couples who were well 
suited to each other temperamentally but one or the other could not 
find the spark. People and their relationships are too complex to 
reduce to a single aspect—but it is still reasonable to note that a 
good marriage is accompanied by mutual desire, mutually requited. 
Unfortunately, desire is not something that can be managed in 
isolation: “Let us fix our sex life” is a resolution too narrow in 
ambition to fulfill its aim. 

There must be a broader, relationship-wide strategy in place to 
maintain romance with your partner across time. Regardless of 
what that strategy might be, its success is going to depend on your 
ability to negotiate. To negotiate, you and the person you are 
negotiating with must first know what you each need (and want)— 
and second, be willing to discuss both forthrightly. There are many 
serious obstacles both to knowing what you need and want, and to 
discussing it. If you allow yourself to know what you want, then you 
will also know precisely when you are failing to get it. You will 
benefit, of course, because you will also know when you have 
succeeded. But you might also fail, and you could well be frightened 
enough by the possibility of not getting what you need (and want) 
that you keep your desires vague and unspecified. And the chance 
that you will get what you want if you fail to aim for it is vanishingly 
small. 

Aim is likely a problem for you. If you have a partner, the 
problem may be compounded. The person you have chosen is 
unlikely to be any smarter about you than you are, except in minor 
instances (and is in fact likely to be even more in the dark with 
regard to your innermost desires). Your failure to specify your 
desires means your unfortunate lover will have to guess what would 
please and displease you, and is likely to be punished in some 
manner for getting it wrong. Furthermore, given all the things you 


could want—and do not want—t is virtually certain that your lover 
will get it wrong. In consequence, you will be motivated to blame 
them, at least implicitly, or nonverbally, or unconsciously, for not 
caring enough to notice what you are unwilling even to notice 
yourself. “If you really loved me,” you will think—or feel, without 
thinking—“I would not have to tell you what would make me 
happy.” This is not a practical approach to a happy marriage. 

That is all bad enough, but there is a second and equally severe 
problem lurking in the byways. If you have solved the problem of 
knowing what you want, admitted it to yourself in a verbalizable 
form, and let someone else know your wishes, you have then 
granted them a dangerous source of power. The person whom you 
have made your confidant is now in a position to fulfill your desires, 
but could equally deprive you of what you want, embarrass you for 
wanting it, or hurt you in some other manner, because you have 
now made yourself vulnerable. Naive people are possessed of the 
delusion that everyone is good, and that no one—particularly 
someone loved—would be motivated to cause pain and misery, 
either for revenge, as a consequence of blindness, or merely for the 
pleasure of doing so. But people who have matured enough to 
transcend their naivete have learned that they can be hurt and 
betrayed both by themselves and at the hands of others. So why 
increase the odds of being hurt by letting someone in? It is to 
defend against such betrayal that naivete is often replaced by 
cynicism, and it must be said in all truth that the latter is an 
improvement over the former. But such substitution is not the final 
word in wisdom, and thank God for that. Trust in turn trumps 
cynicism, and true trust is not naivete. Trust between people who 
are not naive is a form of courage, because betrayal is always a 
possibility, and because this is consciously understood. This applies 
with particular force within the confines of an intimate relationship. 
To trust is to invite the best in your partner to manifest itself, with 
yourself and your freely given trust as the enticement. This is a 
risky business, but the alternative is the impossibility of true 
intimacy, and the sacrifice of what could have been two minds in 


dialogue working in tandem to address the difficult problems of life 
for a single mind striving in solitude. 

Romance requires trust—and the deeper the trust, the deeper the 
possibility for romance. But trust has its requirements, as well, 
apart from the courage required of the individuals wise enough to 
distrust but brave enough to risk putting their faith in a partner. The 
first of those requirements is truth. You cannot maintain trust in 
yourself if you lie. You cannot maintain trust in yourself, likewise, if 
you act in a manner that would require a lie if it was discovered. 
Similarly, you cannot maintain trust in your partner if he or she lies, 
or betrays you in action or in silence. So, the vow that makes a 
marriage capable of preserving its romantic component is first and 
foremost the decision not to lie to your partner. 

There are also immense practical advantages to this, if practiced 
properly. There will come a time in your life when you have done 
something you should not have done or failed to do something that 
you should have done. You may need advice. You may need support. 
You may need exactly what your partner could provide, if only you 
dared to allow them to help. And at some time they are going to find 
themselves in exactly the same position. Life is too difficult to 
negotiate alone. If you tell your partner the truth, and you strive to 
act so that you can tell the truth about how you act, then you have 
someone to rely on when the seas become high and your ship 
threatens to founder. This can literally be a matter of life or death. 
In a relationship where romance remains intact, truth must be king. 


CHRIST IN THE CANDLE 


I have a friend of Scandinavian descent, although he is Canadian. 
He married a Canadian woman, also of Scandinavian descent. They 
decided to get married in Sweden, as a tribute to their joint ancestry. 
They were both at least nominally Christian, so they were married 
in a ceremony reflecting that. During their exchange of vows, the 
bride and groom held a lit candle aloft between them. I spent a long 
time thinking about the significance of that ritual. 


There is an ancient conceit in the book of Genesis (2:21—22) that 
Eve was taken out of Adam—created from his rib. Woman from 
man: this presents something of a mystery, reversing, as it does, the 
normative biological sequence, where males emerge from females 
at birth. It also gave rise to a line of mythological speculation, 
attempting to account for the strangeness of this creative act, 
predicated on the supposition that Adam, the original man produced 
by God, was hermaphroditic—half masculine and half feminine— 
and only later separated into the two sexes. This implies not only 
the partition of a divinely produced unity, but the incompleteness of 
man and woman until each is brought together with the other.* The 
fact that the candle is held jointly indicates the binding of the two 
celebrants. The fact that the candle is held aloft, lit, implies that 
something higher—something superordinate—is representing or 
performing the union. Light, light in the heavens, light in the 
darkness, illumination, enlightenment. Prior to the invention of 
modern electric lights, candles were often used for this purpose. 
Evergreens, the standard choice for Christmas trees, represent life 
unending, as they do not “die” annually in the same manner as their 
deciduous counterparts. Such trees therefore symbolize the Tree of 
Life, which serves as the very foundation of the cosmos.* So, we 
illuminate the Tree of Life, at or near December 21, the darkest time 
of year, at least in the Northern Hemisphere.* That is why 
Christmas is located where it is on the calendar; the reappearance of 
the light is associated with the birth of the Universal Savior— 
signifying the eternal reemergence of light in the Stygian blackness. 

Christ has long been regarded as the second (perfected) Adam 
and, just as there was speculation about the hermaphroditic nature 
of the first Adam prior to God’s creation of the independent sexes, 
there is a line of speculation about Christ’s spiritual perfection 
being a consequence of the ideal balance of masculine and feminine 
elements.*° It is very difficult for individuals joining themselves 
together to become desperate enough to cease their hiding and 
avoidance, live in truth, and repair themselves in the light cast by 
their joint existence. It is for this reason that both swear the dread 
vow of permanence (“What God has joined together, let not man 


put asunder” [Matthew 19:6]). “I am bound to you,” claims one 
party to the agreement. “And I to you,” says the other, and both 
think, if they have any sense, that they should each transform 
themselves and one another, to forestall any unnecessary suffering. 
So, what is the superordinate principle to which both marital 
partners must bow? It is not illumination as mere verbal 
abstraction. It is not that they are only supposed to think and speak 
the truth. It is that they are supposed to act it out. And that is the 
ancient idea that the Word should be made flesh. 

The individuals who make up a married couple might well engage 
in a lifelong struggle concerning a single inappropriately 
conceptualized question: “Who is subordinate to whom in a 
marriage?” After all, each might reason, as people commonly do, 
that such an arrangement is a zero-sum game, with one winner and 
one loser. But a relationship does not have to be and should not be a 
question of one or the other as winner, or even each alternating in 
that status, in an approximation of fairness. Instead, the couple can 
decide that each and both are subordinate to a principle, a higher- 
order principle, which constitutes their union in the spirit of 
illumination and truth. That ghostly figure, the ideal union of what 
is best in both personalities, should be constantly regarded as the 
ruler of the marriage—and, indeed, as something as close to divine 
as might be practically approached by fallible individuals. That is 
what the ceremony of the candle represents: Neither participant 
rules the other. Instead, both bow to the principle of illumination. 
In that circumstance, it is not that one must abide by what the other 
wants (or vice versa). Instead, it is that both should be oriented 
toward the most positive future possible, and agree that speaking 
the truth is the best pathway forward. That orientation and 
truthfulness will engender a transformative dialogue, verbal and 
nonverbal, if the partners in the arrangement commit to abiding by 
the consequence of that dialogue. Voluntary subordination to this 
higher-order principle of illumination both unifies and revitalizes. 

Imagine that you have just participated in such a ceremony. What 
does your participation signify? Do you believe in the ideas that you 
have just acted out? Do you believe that man and woman were once 


together, as a single being, were then separated, and must be 
restored as a unity? You can believe it dramatically, poetically, and 
metaphorically instead of merely rationally and mechanically, and 
that can lead you to deep truths. Do you want to find your soul 
mate? It is a romantic trope, obviously, but there are deep reasons 
for the existence of romantic fictions. Maybe you take someone on a 
date to a romantic movie. You both watch the movie hero and 
heroine find their soul mates. If you are fortunate, while you are 
watching you are thinking, “Well, maybe this person I am sitting 
with is the one for me, too.” In the best of all situations, that is also 
what your date is hoping for. Maybe that is too much to hope for in 
real life. But the romantic part of you is longing for it regardless. 
There is an inevitable yearning in our natures for the completion 
that someone else might provide. There is a sense that you are 
missing something, otherwise, and that only the proper romantic 
union will provide it. It is true, too—you are indeed missing 
something. If you were not, sex would never have evolved. The 
entire biological course of our destiny, since reproduction 
progressed past the mere division of cells, appears driven by the fact 
that it was better for two dissimilar creatures to come together to 
produce a comparatively novel version of themselves than to merely 
clone their current embodiment. You have your idiosyncrasies, your 
blind spots, your biases. Some of these are implicit. They are often 
paired inextricably with your unique talents: you seldom gain an 
advantage without a corresponding disadvantage, and you are a 
particular person, with particular attributes. If you are on your own, 
you are inevitably lopsided, one-sided. That is often not for the best. 
There is unrealized utility in the marital institution about which 
we have become cynical—a consequence of our immaturity and 
naivete. A marriage is a vow, and there is a reason for it. You 
announce jointly, publicly: “I am not going to leave you, in sickness 
or health, in poverty or wealth—and you are not going to leave me.” 
It is actually a threat: “We are not getting rid of each other, no 
matter what.” You are shackled together, like two angry cats at the 
bottom of a barrel with the lid on. In principle, there is no escape. If 
you have any sense (besides the optimism of new love) you also 


think, “Oh, God. That is a horrifying possibility.” The part of you 
that claims to desire freedom (but really wants to avoid any 
permanent and therefore terrifying responsibility) desires a 
trapdoor through which escape might be made, if and when it is 
necessary. That seems convenient—and it is true that there are 
unbearable marriages—but it is an option with extreme perils. Do 
you really want to keep asking yourself for the rest of your life— 
because you would always have the option to leave—if you made the 
right choice? In all likelihood, you did not. There are seven billion 
people in the world. At least a hundred million (let us say) might 
have made good partners for you. You certainly did not have time to 
try them out, and the probability that you found the theoretically 
optimal person approaches zero. But you do not find so much as 
make, and if you do not know that you are in real trouble. 
Furthermore, if you have an escape route, there will not be enough 
heat generated in the chamber you find yourself jointly trapped in 
to catalyze the change necessary in both of you—the maturation, the 
development of wisdom—because maturation and the development 
of wisdom require a certain degree of suffering, and suffering is 
escapable as long as there is an out. 

You are not going to get along with your partner—not easily, 
unless you agree to be tyrannized and silent (and even then you will 
take your revenge)—because you are different people. No one just 
simply gets along, precisely because of that. And not only are you 
different from your partner, but you are rife with inadequacies and 
so is he—or she. And that is not bad enough. There is also the fact 
that even people of good will and character locked together in 
matrimony will face the mundane, quotidian, dull, tragic, and 
terrible together, because life can be—and certainly will be at some 
point—difficult to the point of impossibility. It is going to be tough. 
Even if you strive to pull yourselves together, and succeed at that 
admirably, there are going to be brutal times, and they are not 
necessarily going to be brief. Maybe life will be better if you stay 
together—that is the hope, and the likelihood, as far as I can tell— 
but the brutal times will still be there. What is going to make you 
voluntarily deal with your differences and establish a genuine 


agreement, a true consensus? You are going to have to negotiate in 
good faith, continually, to come to some sort of peaceful and 
productive accommodation. And if you do not? You are going to 
have your hands around each other’s throats for sixty years. 

In clinical practice, I have seen whole families in that situation. 
Imagine five people in a circle. Imagine further that each has their 
hands around the neck of the person in front of them. All are 
squeezing with just enough force to kill in a few decades. This is a 
decision, formulated over years of unspoken argument and refusal 
to negotiate: “I am going to kill you. It is just going to take me a 
lifetime.” It is very possible that you have someone you might like 
to slowly throttle in your family, or who is currently doing it to you. 
Perhaps not, hopefully not (perhaps you would not admit it even if 
you knew it was true)—but it is common enough. If you do not 
negotiate peace with your partner, that is the situation you will find 
yourself in. There are three fundamental states of social being: 
tyranny (you do what I want), slavery (I do what you want), or 
negotiation. Tyranny is obviously not so good for the person 
enslaved, but it is also not good for the tyrant—because he or she 
becomes a tyrant, and there is nothing ennobling about that. There 
is nothing but cynicism, cruelty, and the hell of unregulated anger 
and impulsivity. Slavery is not good either, likewise for the slave 
and the tyrant. Slaves are miserable, wretched, angry, and resentful. 
They will take any and all chances whatsoever available to them to 
take revenge on their tyrants, who will in consequence find 
themselves cursed and damaged by their slaves. It is not easy to get 
the best out of someone by arbitrarily brandishing a stick at them, 
particularly when they try to do something good (and that 
diminution of spirit is the cruelest trick of the tyrant). But you can 
be certain, you want-to-be tyrants, that your slaves will take their 
revenge where they can, even if that means merely being much less 
than they could be. 

My wife told me a terrible story once, about a couple she 
observed while volunteering in a palliative care ward. The husband 
was dying, and his wife was trimming his nails—a little too close. 
With each clip, there was blood, as she trimmed close enough to 


damage the quick. You see something like that, and wisdom speaks 
its terrible truth: “I know exactly what is going on there.” That is the 
end stage of an unbelievably deceitful and brutal relationship. It is 
subtle. It does not announce itself loudly as murderous. No one 
knows, except the couple (even though they are perhaps striving 
with all their might, under the circumstances, not to know) and the 
careful observer, who sees a dying man and a wife who has 
determined, for whatever reasons, to make his death a little worse. 
That is not a desirable outcome. You do not want to end up in that 
situation, or anything like it. You want to negotiate. The question is, 
“What is going to make you desperate enough to negotiate?” And 
that is one of the mysteries that must be addressed if you wish to 
keep the romance alive in your relationship. 


NEGOTIATION, TYRANNY, OR SLAVERY 


Negotiation is exceptionally difficult. We already discussed the 
problems associated with determining what you want and then 
mustering up the courage to tell someone exactly that. And there 
are the tricks that people use, too, to avoid negotiation. Perhaps you 
ask your partner what he or she wants—perhaps during a difficult 
situation. “I don’t know” is a common answer (you get that from 
children, too, and even more often from adolescents). It is not 
acceptable, however, in a discussion that cannot in good faith be 
avoided. Sometimes “I don’t know” truly means what it is supposed 
to mean—the person who utters the phrase is at a genuine loss—but 
often it means, instead: “I don’t want to talk about it, so go away 
and leave me alone.” Irritation or outright anger, sufficient to deter 
the questioner, often accompanies this response. That brings the 
discussion to a halt, and it can stay halted forever. Maybe that has 
happened once or twice or a dozen times too often, so you—the 
questioner, in this instance—have had enough of your partner’s 
refusal, or you have decided that you are done being cowardly or a 
victim of your own misplaced compassion and you are not about to 
take “I don’t know” for an answer. In consequence, you persist in 


pursuing your target. “Well, guess,” you might say. “Throw 
something on the table, for God’s sake. I do not care what it is. Even 
if it is wrong, it is at least a start.” “I don’t know” means not only 
“Go away and leave me alone.” It also frequently means “Why don’t 
you go away, do all the work necessary to figure out what is wrong, 
and come back and tell me—if you’re so smart,” or “It is intolerably 
rude of you to refuse to allow me to remain in my willful or 
dangerous ignorance, given that it obviously bothers me so much to 
think about my problems.” It is not rude, though—or even if it is, 
you still need to know what your partner wants, and so does he or 
she, and how in the world are either or both of you going to figure it 
out if you cannot even get the conversation off the ground? It is not 
rude. It is a cruel act of love. 

Persistence under such conditions is a necessity, a terrible 
necessity, akin to surgery. It is difficult and painful because it takes 
courage and even some foolhardiness to continue a discussion when 
you have been told in no uncertain terms by your partner to go the 
hell away (or worse). It is a good thing, however—an admirable act— 
because a person bothered by something they do not wish to talk 
about is very likely to be split internally over the issue at hand. The 
part that wants to avoid is the part that gets angry. There is a part 
that wants to talk, too, and to settle the issue. But doing so is going 
to be cognitively demanding, ethically challenging, and emotionally 
stressful. In addition, it is going to require trust, and people test 
trust, not least by manifesting anger when approached about 
something touchy just to determine if the person daring the 
approach cares sufficiently to overcome a serious barrier or two or 
three or ten to get to the horrible bottom of things. And avoidance 
followed by anger is not the only trick in the book. 

The next serious hurdle is tears. Tears are easily mistaken for the 
distress due to sadness, and they are very effective at bringing 
tenderhearted people to a dead halt as a consequence of their 
misplaced compassion. (Why misplaced? Because if you leave the 
person alone because of their tears, they quit suffering right then, 
but continue with their unresolved problem until they solve it, 
which might be never.) Tears, however, are just as often anger 


(perhaps more often) as they are sadness or distress. If the person 
you are chasing down and cornering is red-faced, for example, in 
addition to their tears, then he or she is probably angry, not hurt 
(that is not inevitably the case, but it is a reasonably common sign). 
Tears are an effective defense mechanism, as it takes a heart of 
stone to withstand them, but they tend to be the last-ditch attempt 
at avoidance. If you can get past tears, you can have a real 
conversation, but it takes a very determined interlocutor to avoid 
the insult and hurt generated by anger (defense one) and the pity 
and compassion evoked by tears (defense two). It requires someone 
who has integrated their shadow (their stubbornness, harshness, 
and capacity for necessary emotionless implacability) and can use it 
for long-term benefit. Do not foolishly confuse “nice” with “good.” 

Remember the options previously discussed: negotiation, 
tyranny, or slavery. Of those, negotiation is the least awful, even 
though it is no joke to negotiate, and it is perhaps the most difficult 
of the three, in the short term, because you have to fight it out, now, 
and God only knows how deep you are going to have to go, how 
much diseased tissue you will have to remove. For all you know, 
you are fighting with the spirit of your wife’s grandmother, who was 
treated terribly by her alcoholic husband, and the consequences of 
that unresolved abuse and distrust between the sexes are echoing 
down the generations. Children are amazing mimics. They learn 
much of what they know implicitly long before they can use 
language, and they imitate the bad along with the good. It is for this 
reason that it has been said that the sins of the fathers will be 
visited on the children to the third and fourth generation (Numbers 
14:18). 

Hope, of course, can drive us through the pain of negotiation, but 
hope is not enough. You need desperation, as well, and that is part 
of the utility of “till death do us part.” You are stuck with each other, 
if you are serious—and if you are not serious, you are still a child. 
That is the point of the vow: the possibility of mutual salvation, or 
the closest you can manage here on Earth. In a truly mature 
marriage, if your health holds out, you are there for the 
aforementioned sixty years, like Moses in the desert searching for 


the Promised Land, and there is plenty of trouble that must be 
worked through—all of it—before peace might be established. So, 
you grow up when you marry, and you aim for peace as if your soul 
depends upon it (and perhaps that is more serious than your life 
depending on it), and you make it work or you suffer miserably. You 
will be tempted by avoidance, anger, and tears, or enticed to employ 
the trapdoor of divorce so that you will not have to face what must 
be faced. But your failure will haunt you while you are enraged, 
weeping, or in the process of separating, as it will in the next 
relationship you stumble into, with all your unsolved problems 
intact and your negotiating skills not improved a whit. 

You can keep the possibility of escape in the back of your mind. 
You can avoid the commitment of permanence. But then you cannot 
achieve the transformation, which might well demand everything 
you can possibly muster. The difficulty, however, that is implicit in 
the negotiation carries with it a tremendous promise, which is part 
of a radically successful life: You could have a marriage that works. 
You could make it work. That is an achievement—a tangible, 
challenging, exceptional, and unlikely achievement. There are not 
many genuine achievements of that magnitude in life; a number as 
small as four is a reasonable estimate. Maybe, if you strive for it, 
you have established a solid marriage. That is achievement one. 
Because of that, you have founded a solid and reliable, honest and 
playful home into which you could dare bring children. Then you 
can have kids, and with a solid marriage that can work out for you. 
That is achievement two. Then you have brought upon yourself 
more of the responsibility that will demand the best from you. Then 
you will have new relationships of the highest quality, if you are 
fortunate and careful. Then you will have grandchildren so that you 
are surrounded by new life when yours begins to slip away. In our 
culture, we live as if we are going to die at thirty. But we do not. We 
live a very long time, but it is also all over in a flash, and it should be 
that you have accomplished what human beings accomplish when 
they live a full life, and marriage and children and grandchildren 
and all the trouble and heartbreak that accompanies all of that is far 
more than half of life. Miss it at your great peril. 


You meet people, usually young, unwise but laden with the 
unearned cynicism that substitutes for wisdom in youth, and they 
say, categorically—even pridefully—“I do not want children.” Plenty 
of nineteen-year-olds say that, and that is acceptable, in some sense, 
because they are nineteen, and they have time, and what do they 
know at nineteen, anyway? And some twenty-seven-year-olds say 
that, but not so many, particularly if they are female and the least 
bit honest with themselves. And some forty-five-year-olds say the 
same thing, in the past tense, and some of them, perhaps, are telling 
the truth; but most are celebrating closing the barn door after the 
cattle have bolted. No one will speak the truth about this. To note 
outright that we lie to young women, in particular, about what they 
are most likely to want in life is taboo in our culture, with its 
incomprehensibly strange insistence that the primary satisfaction in 
the typical person’s life is to be found in career (a rarity in itself, as 
most people have jobs, not careers). But it is an uncommon woman, 
in my clinical and general professional experience, regardless of 
brilliance or talent, training, discipline, parental desire, youthful 
delusion, or cultural brainwashing who would not perform whatever 
sacrifice necessary to bring a child into the world by the time she is 
twenty-nine, or thirty-five, or worse, forty. 

Here is a pathway to misery I would strongly recommend 
avoiding, aimed primarily at the women who read this book 
(although wise boyfriends and husbands should take equal note). 
Decide that you want children when you are twenty-nine or thirty, 
and then be unable to have them: I would not recommend that. You 
will not recover. We are too fragile to play around with what life 
might offer us. Everyone thinks, when they are young and do not 
know any better, “Well, pregnancy can be taken for granted.” That is 
only true if you absolutely do not want and should not have a child, 
and you have sex in the backseat of a car when you are fifteen. 
Then, for sure, you will find yourself in trouble. But a successful 
pregnancy is not a foregone conclusion, not by any stretch of the 
imagination. You can push trying for children to the older end of 
that spectrum—and many people are encouraged or encourage 


themselves to do exactly that—but up to 30 percent of couples 
experience trouble becoming pregnant.® 

You encounter something similar—that is, the incaution about 
what life will and will not offer—when people whose marriages have 
stagnated begin to develop the delusion that a romantic affair will 
address their unmet needs. When I had clients considering such a 
move—or perhaps involved in an affair, currently—I tried to bring 
them back down to earth. “Let us think it through, all the way. Not 
just for this week, or this month. You are fifty. You have this 
twenty-four-year-old, and she is willing to break up your marriage. 
What is she thinking? Who must she be? What does she know?” 
“Well, Iam really attracted to her.” “Yes, but she has a personality 
disorder. Seriously, because what the hell is she doing with you, and 
why is she willing to break up this marriage?” “Well, she does not 
care if I stay married.” “Oh, I see. So, she does not want to have an 
actual relationship with someone, with any degree of long-term 
permanency. Somehow that is going to work out well for you, is it? 
Just think about that. It is going to be a little rough on your wife. A 
lot of lies are going to go along with that. You have children—how 
are they going to respond when all this comes out, as it most 
certainly will? And what do you think about the ten years in court 
that are now beckoning, that are going to cost you a third of a 
million dollars and put you in a custody battle that will occupy all 
your time and attention?” 

I have seen people who were in custody battles who would 
seriously have preferred cancer. It is no joke to have your arm 
caught in the dangerous machinery of the courts. You spend much 
of the time truly wishing you were dead. So that is your “affair,” for 
God’s sake. It is even more delusional than that, because, of course, 
if you are married to someone, you often see them at their worst, 
because you have to share the genuine difficulties of life with them. 
You save the easy parts for your adulterous partner: no 
responsibility, just expensive restaurants, exciting nights of rule 
breaking, careful preparation for romance, and the general absence 
of reality that accompanies the privilege of making one person pay 
for the real troubles of existence while the other benefits 


unrealistically from their absence. You do not have a life with 
someone when you have an affair with them. You have an endless 
array of desserts (at least in the beginning), and all you have to do is 
scoop the whipped cream off the top of each of them and devour it. 
That is it. You see each other under the best possible conditions, 
with nothing but sex in your minds and nothing else interfering 
with your lives. As soon as it transforms from that into a 
relationship that has any permanency, a huge part of the affair 
immediately turns right back into whatever it was that was 
bothering you about your marriage. An affair is not helpful, and 
people end up horribly hurt. Particularly children—and it is to them 
you owe primary allegiance. 

I am not trying to be unreasonably categorical about marriage 
and family. You cannot expect every social institution to work out 
for everyone. Sometimes, you have married someone who is a 
psychopathic brute, a congenital and incorrigible liar, a criminal, an 
alcoholic, a sadist (and maybe all five at once). Then you must 
escape. But that is not a trapdoor. That is a catastrophe, like a 
hurricane, and you should move out of its path. You might be 
tempted to conclude: “Well, how about we live together, instead of 
getting married? We will try each other out. It is the sensible thing 
to do.” But what exactly does it mean, when you invite someone to 
live with you, instead of committing yourself to each other? And let 
us be appropriately harsh and realistic about our appraisal, instead 
of pretending we are taking a used car for a test jaunt. Here is what 
it means: “You will do, for now, and I presume you feel the same 
way about me. Otherwise we would just get married. But in the 
name of a common sense that neither of us possesses we are going 
to reserve the right to swap each other out for a better option at any 
point.” And if you do not think that is what living together means— 
as a fully articulated ethical statement—see if you can formulate 
something more plausible. 

You might think, “Look, Doc, that is pretty cynical.” So why not 
we consider the stats, instead of the opinion of arguably but not 
truly old-fashioned me? The breakup rate among people who are 
not married but are living together—so, married in everything but 


the formal sense—is substantially higher than the divorce rate 
among married couples.* And even if you do get married and make 
an honest person, so to speak, of the individual with whom you 
cohabited, you are still much more rather than less likely to get 
divorced than you would be had you never lived together initially.® 
So the idea of trying each other out? Sounds enticing, but does not 
work. 

It is of course possible that people who are more likely to get 
divorced, for reasons of temperament, are also more likely to live 
together, before or without marriage, rather or in addition to the 
possibility that living together just does not work. It is no simple 
matter to disentangle the two causal factors. But it does not matter, 
practically. Cohabitation without the promise of permanent 
commitment, socially announced, ceremonially established, 
seriously considered, does not produce more robust marriages. And 
there is nothing good about that—particularly for children, who do 
much worse in single parent (generally male-absent) families.* 
Period. So, I just do not see it as a justifiable social alternative. And 
I say that as someone who lived with my wife before I married her. I 
am not innocent in this regard. But that does not mean I was right. 
And there is something else, and it is far from trivial. You just do 
not have that many chances in life to have an intimate relationship 
work out properly. Maybe it takes you two or three years to meet 
the potential Mr. or Ms. Right, and another two or three to 
determine if they are in fact who you think they are. That is five 
years. You get old a lot faster than you think you will, no matter 
how old you are now, and most of what you could do with your 
family—with marriage, children, and so forth—is from 
twentysomething to about thirty-five. How many good five-year 
chances do you therefore have? Three? Four, if you are fortunate? 

This means that your options decrease as you wait, rather than 
increase. If you are a widower, or a widow, and you must hit the 
dating scene when you are forty or fifty, so be it. You have been 
struck by tragedy, and that is life. But I have watched friends do it, 
and it is not a fate I would casually wish on anyone I loved. Let us 
continue to be reasonable about this: All sixteen- to eighteen-year- 


olds have much in common. They are unformed. They are 
malleable. That is not an insult. It is just a fact. It is also why they 
can go off to college and make a lifelong friend (no cynicism 
whatsoever intended) from a roommate within a single semester. 
By the time you are in your midforties, however—if you have lived 
at all—you have become somewhat of a singular and unique person. 
I have known people I met at that time of my life for a decade or 
more whom I still seem to consider new acquaintances. That is a 
pure function of the complexity of increasing age. And that is mere 
friendship, not love—not a joint life and perhaps even the bringing 
together of two disparate families. 

And so you have your marriage and your children, and that is 
working out well because you are stubborn and sufficiently terrified 
of the hell that awaits anyone who fails to negotiate for peace and 
make the sacrifices necessary to establish it. You are undoubtedly 
more prepared now for your career—or more likely, your job. That is 
the third of the four achievements you might manage, with good 
fortune and an undaunted spirit, in the brief flash of your existence. 
You have learned how to establish productive harmony in the close 
confines of your most intimate and private relationships, and some 
of that wisdom spills over into your workplace. You are a mentor for 
younger people, a helpful peer and reliable subordinate, and instead 
of the hash you could so easily make of the place you inhabit, you 
improve it. And if everyone did that the world would be a much less 
tragic and unhappy place. Maybe it would even be a self-evidently 
good place. And perhaps you learn how to make good use of your 
time away from family and work—your leisure—and you make that 
meaningful and productive. And that is the fourth of the four 
achievements—and one, like the others, that can grow. Perhaps you 
get better and better at such things so that you can work on solving 
more and more difficult problems, and become a credit, in your own 
way, to the spirit of humanity itself. And that is life. 

Back to marriage. How do you plan and diligently maintain the 
romance in your relationship? Well, you have to decide: “Do you 
want some romance in your life or not?” If you really think about it, 
without resentment—without the joy of depriving your partner, now 


alienated, of the pleasure that might come with such an attempt— 
the answer is generally yes. Sexual romance: the adventure, 
pleasure, intimacy, and excitement people fantasize about 
experiencing, when they are feeling in need of a touch of the divine. 
You want that. The joys of life are rare and precious, and you do not 
want to forsake them without due cause. How are you going to 
accomplish that? With luck, it will happen between you and 
someone you like; with better luck, and sufficient commitment, it 
will happen between you and someone you love. Little about this is 
easy. If you set up a household with someone, you are going to have 
to do an awful lot of negotiation to keep both “like” and “love” alive. 


THE DOMESTIC ECONOMY 


Here are some practical considerations. They may seem far from the 
topic of romance. The discussion is necessary, however, because we 
transcended—or lost—our traditional roles, and have not formulated 
replacements for them. Before that—perhaps before the invention 
of the birth control pill, which was a biological revolution—men did 
male things, whatever they were, and women did female things, 
whatever they were. Traditional roles are far more helpful than 
modern people, who vastly overestimate their tolerance for freedom 
and choice, tend to realize. In a less rapidly mutable society, 
everyone has some sense of their respective duties. That does not 
eliminate the tension (nothing eliminates the tension), but at least 
there is a template. If there is no template for what either of you 
should be doing when you live together with someone, then you are 
required to argue about it—or negotiate about it, if you are good at 
that, which you are probably not. Few people are. 

If you are going to set up a household in peace with someone you 
love and hopefully like, and wish to continue loving and liking, you 
are going to have to determine in some manner who is going to do 
what. That is the replacement for roles. Who makes the bed? When 
should it be made? At what level of perfection does the bed have to 
be made to be mutually acceptable? And if this is not handled well, 


the conversation becomes counterproductive rapidly: “I made the 
bed.” “Well, you did not do a very good job.” “Nothing’s ever good 
enough for you. If you do not think I did a good enough job making 
the bed, maybe I will just stop, and you can make it yourself!” “Well, 
maybe you should raise your standards a bit, and maybe not just 
about the bed!” It is going to take days to sort that out—if it ever 
does get sorted out—and that is just the bed. That is just the first ten 
minutes of the morning. So maybe it remains unmade or made 
badly and bitterly for the next sixty years (there is that time span 
again), and there are many more domestic issues to address than 
just the bed. But if that is not sorted out, then it is a problem every 
morning of every day and every day of every week and month and 
year and everyone is angry at least under the surface as soon as they 
awaken or every time they enter the bedroom and other things 
begin to fall out of order. There is nothing good about that. 

Whose career is going to take priority? When and why? How will 
the children be educated and disciplined, and by whom? Who does 
the cleaning? Who sets the table? Takes out the garbage? Cleans up 
the bathroom? How are the bank accounts set up and managed? 
Who shops for groceries? Clothes? Furniture? Who pays for what? 
Who adopts responsibility for the taxes? Et cetera, et cetera, et 
cetera. Two hundred things, perhaps, to run a household properly— 
as complex a problem as running a business, with the additional 
difficulty of trying to manage it with a family member, much of it 
repeated daily. Your life is, after all, mostly composed of what is 
repeated routinely. You either negotiate responsibility for every 
single one of these duties or you play push and pull forever, while 
you battle it out nonverbally, with stubbornness, silence, and half- 
hearted attempts at “cooperation.” That is not going to do your 
romantic situation any good. It is of vital necessity, in consequence, 
to place the domestic part of the household economy on firm 
ground. 

It is an incredibly difficult set of problems to solve, because it 
means you must consciously sort the hierarchy of responsibilities 
between the partners in the household. You are required to 
negotiate every damned and apparently trivial detail (but the 


apparent triviality is a delusion): Who prepares the meals? When do 
they prepare the meals? What is that worth in terms of trade-off for 
other tasks? How do you thank someone for conducting themselves 
properly in the kitchen? Who loads the dishwasher? Who does the 
dishes? How fast do the dishes have to be cleared off the table after 
you eat? Which dishes are going to be used? What are we going to 
eat? What role are the kids going to play? Do we sit down together? 
Do we have regular mealtimes? Each of these questions can become 
a bloody war. One person thinks one thing, and the other person 
thinks another thing, and who knows who’s right? So, you have to 
have a struggle with it, and you have to come to a consensus. Doing 
so is difficult. Maybe it means hundreds of fights. It certainly means 
dozens. But they are fights with a purpose, and that purpose is to 
fight it out until a solution arises, so that fights about that issue are 
no longer necessary. That makes peace the goal, and it cannot be 
established except through negotiation, and that requires a 
commitment strong enough to withstand serious and deep conflict. 
The next thing you have to do—I know this from both my clinical 
and marital experience (thirty years of each)—is actually talk to 
your partner for about ninety minutes a week, purely about practical 
and personal matters. “What is happening to you at work?” “What is 
going on, as far as you are concerned, with the kids?” “What needs 
to be done around the house?” “Is there anything bothering you that 
we can address?” “What do we have to do that is necessary to keep 
the wolf from the door next week?” Just pure, practical 
communication: partly because you have a story, your partner has a 
story, and you have a joint story. To know your story, you must tell 
it, and, for your partner to know it, he or she must hear it. It is 
necessary for that communication to happen on an ongoing basis. It 
does not have to be ninety minutes all at once. Maybe it can be 
fifteen minutes a day. But you keep those lines of pragmatic 
communication open, so you know where the other person is, and 
vice versa. If you dip below ninety minutes a week, you generate a 
backlog, and your mutual story begins to unwind. At some point, 
that backlog is so large that you do not know who you are yourself, 
and you certainly do not know who your partner is, and you become 


mutually alienated. Your relationship loses its coherence. That is a 
bad situation. 

When I am helping someone straighten out their marriage, let us 
say, we do very mundane things. I am not interested in vacations, 
special occasions, or anything that happens that is out of the 
ordinary. It is not that those things are unimportant, but they are 
not vital in the same sense that daily routines are vital. It is the 
latter that must be set right. I want to know what interrelationships 
constitute the bulk of your typical day. You wake up together, 
perhaps; you eat together. You do such things every day. Maybe 
waking up, preparing for the day, and eating make up five hours a 
day. That is a third of your waking time and, therefore, a third of 
your life. It is thirty-five hours every seven days—a whole 
workweek; an entire career. Get it right. Ask yourself and each 
other: How do we want these times to be structured? How can we 
make the morning awakening pleasant? Can we attend to each other 
politely and with interest and perhaps without electronic 
distractions while we eat? Could we make our meals delicious and 
the atmosphere welcoming? Consider coming home in the evening. 
Let us say that routine takes ten minutes. So that is another hour 
plus per week; fifty hours a year—one and a half workweeks. You 
spend one and a half workweeks a year being greeted as you come in 
the door. It is a sizable fraction of your existence. Does somebody 
meet you at the door and indicate a certain degree of happiness to 
see you, or are you ignored because everyone is using their 
smartphones, or met with a litany of complaints? How would you 
like to organize that, so you do not dread the moment you arrive at 
home? There are things you do together that are mundane things; 
those things you do every day. But they are your whole life. You get 
those things right and you have established yourself much more 
effectively than you might realize. If you can successfully fight the 
war that establishes harmony in the domestic economy, you have 
both won a major victory. And then you can concentrate on what 
might happen during a romantic vacation to a boutique hotel, or 
your parents’ cottage, or an all-inclusive resort, or an adventure 


holiday—or just during that twice-weekly date we discussed earlier 
that you are both so reluctant to attempt. 

Start by getting these things straight, and see what happens. Then 
you will have peaceful mealtimes, for example, and you will not die 
of frustration or high blood pressure. You will have to fight for such 
an accomplishment. What matters, however, is not whether you 
fight (because you have to fight), but whether you make peace as a 
consequence. To make peace is to manage a negotiated solution. 
And you want and need to come to a negotiated solution about every 
responsibility and opportunity you share as a couple—and about 
every obstacle you encounter. At least then you will have someone 
to talk things through with when your life gets complex, as it 
inevitably will. And you have the advantage of two heads, even 
though they will not see eye to eye. What all this means is that the 
problems of knowing what you want and discussing it with your 
partner must be solved before the romance in your relationship can 
be maintained. 

Other people keep you sane. That is partly why it is a good idea to 
get married. Why? Well, you are half insane, and so is your spouse 
(well, maybe not half—but plenty). Hopefully, however, it is not 
generally the same half. Now and then you meet couples who have 
the same weakness, and they compound that failing in each other. 
Maybe they are both too fond of wine, for example, and they drift 
together toward alcoholism. What you might want, to avoid such a 
fate, is that one person in the couple is fond of alcohol, but not both. 
This will cause a certain amount of short-term conflict, in situations 
where drinking is occurring or likely to occur, but the long-term 
consequences (avoiding either of you becoming an alcoholic) are 
likely to be beneficial. The one who does not drink will have a drink 
or two on a Social occasion, just to avoid being too rigid and 
horrible, and the one who likes to drink will get what is hopefully a 
salutary reprimand if he or she does not exercise proper control. 

It is a fortunate happenstance, generally speaking, that your 
idiosyncrasies are likely to be somewhat randomly distributed, and 
that if you unite with someone else you are likely to find some 
strength where you are weak and vice versa. When you unite the 


two of you to recreate that original being—that is the symbolic idea 
—then you have a chance of producing one reasonable, sane being. 
That is good for you both, even better for your children (who now 
have a fighting chance of adapting to what constitutes generally 
sane behavior), and it is good for friendship and the broader world, 
too. 

A lot of that movement toward functional unity is a consequence 
of dialogue and communication. If you are old enough, you know 
that people are badly broken. When you are young and not very 
experienced, you are likely to make two assumptions, in a rather 
unquestioning and implicit manner, that are simply not true. The 
first is that there is someone out there who is perfect. You are likely 
even to encounter this hypothetically perfect person, whom you 
view through your delusion, and to fall desperately and foolishly in 
love with them (foolishly because you are in love with your 
projection of perfection, rather than the person—which is very 
confusing to the target of your affection). The second assumption is 
that there is someone out there who is perfect for you. From these 
assumptions, you are making at least three errors, which is quite an 
accomplishment, given you have made only two assumptions. 

To begin with, there is not anyone out there who is perfect. There 
are just people out there who are damaged—quite severely, although 
not always irreparably, and with a fair bit of individual idiosyncrasy. 
Apart from that, if there was someone out there who was perfect, 
they would take one look at you and run away screaming. Unless 
you are deceiving someone, why would you end up with anyone 
better than you? You should be truly terrified if you have been 
accepted as a date. A sensible person would think of their new 
potential romantic partner: “Oh, my God! You are either blind, 
desperate, or as damaged as me!” That is a horrifying idea—signing 
up with someone who is as at least as much trouble as you. It is by 
no means as bad as being alone with yourself, but it is still out of 
the frying pan and into the fire—and at least the fire might 
transform you. Thus, you get married, if you have any courage—if 
you have any long-term vision and ability to vow and adopt 
responsibility; if you have any maturity—and you start to transform 


the two of you into one reasonable person. And it is even the case 
that participating in such a dubious process makes the two of you 
into one reasonable person with the possibility of some growth. So, 
you talk. About everything. No matter how painful. And you make 
peace. And you thank providence if you manage it, because strife is 
the default condition. 


FINALLY: ROMANCE 


There was not much point in this chapter in talking about romance 
immediately—at least not about its maintenance. Romance is play, 
and play does not take place easily when problems of any sort arise. 
Play requires peace, and peace requires negotiation. And you are 
lucky even then if you get to play. 

The issue of marital romance—intimacy and sex—is a complex 
one, with a dragon lurking under every question. For example: What 
do you owe each other sexually if you are entangled in a marriage? 
The answer is not “no sex.” That is not the answer, because part of 
the contractual arrangement is to organize your romantic life in a 
mutually satisfactory manner. It is an implicit precondition for the 
stability of the marriage. It is probably not sex fifteen times a day, 
and it is probably not sex begrudgingly once a year. It is somewhere 
between extremes, and that is where you must begin to negotiate. 

My observation has been that the typical adult couple—when they 
have a job, children, and the domestic economy we just discussed, 
and all that worry and responsibility and concern—might manage 
once or twice a week, or even three times a week (not likely), for a 
reasonable romantic interlude. That frequency, if handled well, 
seems to work out acceptably for both partners. I have observed that 
twice is better than once, but once is much better than zero. Zero is 
bad. If you go to zero, then one of you is tyrannizing the other, and 
the other is submitting. If you go to zero, then one of you is going to 
have an affair—physical, emotional, fantastical, or some 
combination of the three. I do not say that lightly. Something has to 
give, and there has to be a no there, somewhere, when the romance 


disappears and the frequency of sexual intimacy hits rock bottom; 
there has to be a strong indication that “that is not good enough.” I 
am not recommending the affair, but that is what you are setting 
yourself up for if your sex life vanishes. Maybe you want to take 
that pathway and facilitate the affair because you want to play the 
martyr: “My wife left me to have an affair, and poor me.” And why 
did she do such a thing? “Well, perhaps our sex life was not all it 
could have been” (and this is an answer that may require a fair bit of 
digging). “What exactly do you mean by ‘was not all it could have 
been’?” “Well, we had not made love for two years, and she went 
and had an affair.” 

That is not a shock. You should begin by assuming that your 
partner is a relatively normal human being, and that there is a 
certain amount of sexual satisfaction that is a reasonable 
requirement—let us say twice a week, or once a week, under 
conditions of intense busyness. In the early days of marriage it 
might be no problem to express romantic interest in your partner, 
but there is so much that must be done to live. Dating is a pain, 
even if you are single. I am perfectly aware that there is adventure 
there, too, but a lot of that occurs in movies, and not on internet 
dating sites, in text exchanges, coffee shops, restaurants, and bars, 
where the first awkward encounters occur. You really have to work 
at it, and you will, if you are single, because you are lonesome, 
starved for attention, and desperate for physical intimacy. (Single 
people have far less sex, on average, than married people, although I 
suppose that a small percentage are making out like bandits. But I 
cannot see that even those successful in that manner are doing 
themselves any favors.) 

So, as a Single person, you will work at dating, because you are 
lonesome and deprived, but it is no simple matter. You must make 
space in your life for it. You have to plan. You must use your 
imagination, spend money, find an acceptable dating partner, and, 
as they say, kiss a lot of frogs to find a prince (or to find a princess, 
as well). People are often relieved when they get married, because 
they do not have to make all that so often counterproductive effort 
anymore. But that does not at all mean that you are now off the 


hook; that you can just lay back in your worn white underwear and 
socks and assume that all the hypothetical pleasures of Hugh 
Hefner are going to automatically manifest themselves in your 
household. There is still plenty of effort required, unless you want 
the romance to vanish. You have to talk about it. You have to have 
the difficult and embarrassing conversation: “What is it going be, 
dear? Tuesday and Thursday? Wednesday and Friday? Monday and 
Saturday?” You think, “Oh, God. That is so cut and dried. That is so 
mundane and planned. That is so scheduled, predictable, bourgeois, 
antiromantic, and robotic. It is demeaning and constricting, and it 
just turns sex into a duty. Where is the fun? Where is the 
spontaneity, the light jazz, cocktails, and excitement of sudden 
unexpected attraction? Where is the tuxedo and the little black 
dress?” That is what you expect? Even unconsciously, in your 
foolish fantasies? How often did you manage that when you were 
dating? Ever? And (remember, we are adults talking here) you want 
two jobs (two careers, two incomes), two kids, a reasonable 
standard of living—and spontaneity? And you are not about to 
“settle” for anything less? 

Good luck with that. It is not going to happen—not in my clinical 
(and personal) experience—not without a lot of effort. What will 
happen is that the absolute necessities of life will inexorably start to 
take priority over the desirable necessities. Maybe there is a list of 
ten things you will do in a day, and sex is number eleven. It is not 
that you do not think sex is important, but you do not ever get past 
number five on the list of ten. You must make space and time, and, 
as far as I can tell, you have to do it consciously. You might think, 
“What would it be like to spend some time with this person I was 
once romantically attracted to?” You have to think that through. 
Maybe you only have time to watch half an hour of a TV show 
before you hop into bed. Maybe you have an hour and a half, or an 
hour, because life is too hectic. It would not be too bad an idea to 
have a shower. A little lipstick—that could be good. Some perfume. 
Some clothing that is attractive and erotic. Buy some lingerie for 
your wife, if you are a man, and wear it, with some courage, if you 
are a woman. Maybe you, if you are a man, can find something to 


wear that is reasonably sexy in a men’s shop or a place that sells 
erotic clothing that is not too extreme and does not scream of poor 
taste and produce intense and counterproductive self- 
consciousness. And a compliment or two when all that courage is 
manifested is not such a bad idea. Maybe each time it happens for a 
year. You are trying to build some confidence. Try some nice soft 
lighting—maybe some candles (and someone has to buy the candles, 
and should be encouraged to do so; and the cynicism should be kept 
to an absolute minimum, if you do not want to banish what is 
fragile out of existence altogether). Here is a rule: do not ever 
punish your partner for doing something you want them to 
continue doing. Particularly if it took some real courage—some real 
going above and beyond the call of duty—to manage. 

How about trying to set up the whole situation in the romantic 
manner that you might imagine, if you were imagining having an 
affair, because that is the sort of thing that people imagine when 
they imagine an affair (if they have any imagination). Try having an 
affair with your wife or husband. Maybe the latter can set up the 
bedroom while the former is preparing in the bathroom. We already 
mentioned candles. How about some music? How about making 
sure that the room is clean and—God willing—aesthetically 
attractive? That might be a start. And maybe, the two you of will not 
get old and fat, unhealthy and hypochondriacal as fast as possible 
just to spite each other, which many couples certainly do. And then, 
maybe, you could both have what you need, and maybe even what 
you want. But you would have to admit your desires, and you would 
have to negotiate with your partner. What do you like? What does 
she like? And are you going to let each other know? Are you going to 
risk practicing badly? Are you going to learn some new tricks, even 
if you feel like a fool when you first try? 

None of this is easy. People will do things with or to each other 
that they will not talk about with each other, which is not helpful if 
they are married. It could be, maybe, if you were in a trading mood 
and approaching this with goodwill, that you could decide what you 
need and want, and arrange exactly the right trade. You might ask 
yourself, “Look, how do I have to set this up so I am likely to 


continue being romantically interested in my wife or my husband 
for the next twenty years, so that I do not wander off and do 
something stupid, like so many people do? What is my minimal 
precondition for erotic satisfaction?” You might try to convince 
yourself that it is not necessary; that you can put up with what you 
have, even if it is nothing. But you cannot. Not if you have any self- 
respect or sense. There is something that you are going to want and 
need. It is possible that, if you communicate openly what that 
something is, and at the same time leave yourself open to the same 
communication coming from your partner, that you both could get 
not only what you want from each other, but even more than you 
expect. 

Arrange some dates, and then practice making those dates and 
going on them until you are expert at it. Negotiate, and practice that, 
too. Allow yourself to become aware of what you want and need, 
and have the decency to let your partner in on the secret. After all, 
who else are you going to tell? Devote yourself to the higher ideal 
upon which an honest and courageous relationship is necessarily 
dependent, and do that with the seriousness that will keep your soul 
intact. Maintain your marital vows, so that you are desperate 
enough to negotiate honestly. Do not let your partner brush you off 
with protestations of ignorance or refusal to communicate. Do not 
be naive, and do not expect the beauty of love to maintain itself 
without all-out effort on your part. Distribute the requirements of 
your household in a manner you both find acceptable, and do not 
tyrannize or subject yourself to slavery. Decide what you need to 
keep yourself satisfied both in bed and out of it. And maybe—just 
maybe—you will maintain the love of your life and you will have a 
friend and confidant, and this cold rock we live on at the far end of 
the cosmos will be a little warmer and more comforting than it 
would otherwise be. And you are going to need that, because rough 
times are always on their way, and you better have something to set 
against them or despair will visit and will not depart. 

Plan and work diligently to maintain the romance in your 
relationship.

RULE Xl 


DO NOT ALLOW YOURSELF TO BECOME 
RESENTFUL, DECEITFUL, OR ARROGANT 


THE STORY IS THE THING 


You have your reasons for being resentful, deceitful, and arrogant. 
You face, or will face, terrible, chaotic forces, and you will 
sometimes be outmatched. Anxiety, doubt, shame, pain, and illness, 
the agony of conscience, the soul-shattering pit of grief, dashed 
dreams and disappointment, the reality of betrayal, subjection to 
the tyranny of social being, and the ignominy of aging unto death— 
how could you not degenerate, and rage, and sin, and come to hate 
even hope itself? I want you to know how you might resist that 
decline, that degeneration into evil. To do so—to understand your 
own personality and its temptation by darkness—you need to know 
what you are up against. You need to understand your motivations 
for evil—and the triad of resentment, deceit, and arrogance is as 
good a decomposition of what constitutes evil as I have been able to 
formulate. 

Is it possible to understand the world in a manner that provides 
protection against the temptation to traverse that lowest of roads? It 
is an axiom of human wisdom that clearer formulation and deeper 
comprehension of a problem is salutary. We will begin just that 
attempt with a conceptual shift—one that is difficult and perplexing 
for the committed materialists we moderns are. First, a question: 
What is the world made of? To answer this, we will need to 
consider reality—the world—as it is fully experienced by someone 


alive and awake, with all the richness of subjective being left intact 
—dreams, sensory experiences, feelings, drives, and fantasies. This 

is the world that manifests itself to—or, better, that you meet head- 
on with—your unique individual consciousness. 

Consider the act of awakening in the morning. If you were asked 
what you perceive, at that moment, you might well mention the 
same concrete objects that anyone else might see, if they woke up in 
bed beside you. You might describe all that you have gathered 
around you in your bedroom—the desk, the chairs, the clothes 
(messy or neatly arrayed, depending on your temperament and 
preference and, perhaps, your condition last night). You are likely to 
answer in this very objective, realistic manner, claiming, essentially, 
to see the furniture of the stage. There is, of course, some truth to 
your answer, although you may pay less attention to the familiar 
things around you than you think. Why waste time and energy 
perceiving what you can simply remember? 

However, the furniture and other contents of your bedroom are 
not truly what you perceive when you first wake up. You are already 
familiar with the place where you sleep, and what it contains. There 
is no reason to continue to effortfully and consciously apprehend 
what you already understand. Instead, you are liable to perceive 
your surroundings psychologically. You begin to consider how you 
are going to conduct yourself on the stage you will inevitably 
occupy, and what is going to happen in consequence. What you see 
upon waking is an array of possibilities, many of them concerning 
the day at hand, and others associated with the weeks, months, and 
years to come. What you are truly concerned with upon waking is 
the answer to a question: “What shall I make of the possibilities 
that I see in play in front of me, complex, worrisome, exciting, dull, 
restricted, unlimited, fortunate, or catastrophic as they may be?” 

Out there in the potential is everything you could have. It is the 
realm of unrealized possibility, and no one knows its full extent. 
There appears to be no limit, in principle, to what can be made from 
what has not yet manifested itself. Everything that might yet be 
makes its home there. You could well consider what remains to be 
encountered as an eternal treasure house—a horn of plenty (which 


are in fact two of its representations). But that is only half the story 
(and there is the rub). If the potential you confront manifests 
improperly (because of a mistake on your part; because of the sheer 
arbitrariness of the world), then you can find yourself in terrible 
trouble. Out there, in the unknown—in the future, which is what 
you truly contend with, when your consciousness reawakens— 
awaits everything good, but also everything terrible, painful, hellish, 
and deadly. Whatever potential might be, therefore, it does not 
follow the simple rules of material logic. Objects that play by the 
rules of the game we consider real (when we assume that what is 
real is also logical) can only be one thing at a time, and certainly not 
themselves and their opposite, simultaneously. Potential, however, 
is not like that. It is not categorizable in that manner. It is tragedy, 
comedy, good and evil, and everything in between at the same time. 
It is also not tangible, in the sense that the things we consider must 
be tangible. It does not even exist—except as what could be exists. 
Perhaps it is best considered as the structure of reality, before 
reality manifests itself concretely in the present, where reality 
appears to most self-evidently exist. But creatures such as us do not 
contend with the present. It may therefore be that it is not the 
present that is most real—at least as far as our consciousness is 
concerned. We have to fight to “be here now,” the advice of the 
sages. Left to our own devices, we turn our minds instead to 
investigating the future: What could be? Attempting to answer that 
question—that is life. That is the true encounter with reality. What 
is? That is the dead past, already accomplished. What could be? 
That is the emergence of new being, new adventure, brought about 
by the conjunction of living consciousness with the great expanse of 
paradoxical possibility. 

And if it is possibility that is most real, rather than actuality (as 
evidenced by the fact that it is possibility we are destined to contend 
with), then it is the investigation into possibility that is the most 
important of all investigations. But how do we investigate 
something that is not here, or there, or anywhere? How do we 
examine what has not yet manifested itself; explore what only could 
be but is not yet? And how can we possibly communicate with each 


other intelligibly about that attempt, trade information about the 
most effective conceptualizations, approaches, and strategies? The 
answer to that, as far as I can tell, is by communicating through 
stories about what is and, equally, what could be. And what that 
implies is that if possibility is the ultimate element of reality with 
which we contend, then it is stories that hold the wisdom that we 
most need to know. 

We naturally think of our lives as stories, and communicate 
about our experience in that same manner. We tell people 
automatically where we are (to set the stage) and where we are 
going, so that we can create the present out of the possibility that 
springs forth as we journey toward our destination. No one finds 
such an account out of the ordinary. But we are doing more than 
portraying our lives, and those of others, as a sequence of events. It 
is something deeper than that. When you depict a person’s actions 
in the world, you describe how they perceive, evaluate, think, and 
act—and, when you do so, a story unfolds (and the better you are at 
such descriptions, the more storylike your accounts are). 
Furthermore, we experience the world as populated by figures that 
represent exactly what we must contend with. The unknown, 
unexpected, and novel—the world of possibility—is represented in 
dramatic form, as is the world that we expect and strive to bring into 
being, and ourselves, as actors faced with the unknown and the 
predictable alike. We use the story to represent all of this. 

Could it be that we communicate in stories (and everyone else 
understands them) because what everyone is doing in the world ts 
fundamentally a story? Could that mean that the world of 
experience is, in truth, indistinguishable from a story—that it 
cannot be represented in a manner more accurate than that of the 
story? We are, in principle, adapted to the world—adapted to its 
realities. Thus, if we naturally construe the world as a story, then 
perhaps the world is most accurately, or at least most practically, 
construed as a story (and accurate and practical are not so easy to 
distinguish). You might argue, contrarily, that the scientific view of 
the world is more accurate, in some sense, and that the scientific 
view is not fundamentally a story. But, as far as I can tell, it is still 


nested inside a story: one that goes something like “careful and 
unbiased pursuit of the truth will make the world a better place for 
all people, reducing suffering, extending life, and producing wealth.” 
Why practice science otherwise? Why would anyone take on the 
difficulties and rigors of scientific training without that motivation? 
There are more effective ways of making money, for example, if you 
have the intelligence and discipline to become a genuine researcher. 
And in terms of intrinsic motivation, the love of science is not 
precisely disinterested learning. The great experimenters and 
scientific writers I have known are passionate about their pursuit. 
Something emotional drives them. They hope that their learning 
(disinterested though it may be, as at present it has no specific aim 
except that of learning) will have some genuinely positive outcome: 
making the world a better place. That provides the entire pursuit 
with a narrative element, the motive that accompanies any good 
plot, and the transformation of character that makes up the best of 
stories. 

We conceptualize what we experience as a story. That story is, 
roughly speaking, the description of the place we are at right now, as 
well as the place that we are going to, the strategies and adventures 
that we implement and experience along the way, and our downfalls 
and reconstitutions during that journey. You perceive and act inside 
a structure like that all the time, because you are always 
somewhere, going somewhere else, and you are always evaluating 
where you are and what is going on in relation to your goal. Part of 
this thinking in stories is our tendency to see the world as a 
selection of characters, each of which represents either where we 
are or are going, the unexpected occurrences we may encounter, or 
ourselves as actors. We see animated intent everywhere*—and we 
certainly present the world that way to our children. That is why 
Thomas the Tank Engine has a face and a smile, and the sun has a 
face and a smile. That is why—even among adults—there is a man in 
the moon, and deities scattered across the stars. Everything is 
animated. That is a reflection of our proclivity to treat things as if 
they are personalities with intent, regardless of what they are, 
regardless of whether they are animate or inanimate. That is why it 


is okay with you that your car has a face (on the front, where faces 
belong), which it most certainly does. 

We act (perceive, think, react) that way because each member of 
the human species does almost everything he or she does in the 
presence, for better or worse, of other people. And that has been the 
case forever. Virtually everything we encountered in the long 
biological rise to our current form was social. If we were not 
interacting with people, then it was with animals. Maybe we were 
hunting them, or herding them, or playing with them, once they had 
been domesticated—or maybe they were hunting us, and we had to 
understand them to escape them or defend ourselves. All that tribal, 
intertribal, and cross-species interaction molded our brains, shaped 
our fundamental categories, rendering them social, not objective— 
not like the categories of science. It is not as if we are born with an 
instinct for the periodic table of the elements. No. We only managed 
to get that straight a few hundred years ago, and it took a lot of 
conscious time and effort to formulate. Furthermore, even though it 
was other people who did the terribly hard work necessary to 
establish that remarkable chemical category system, it is difficult to 
learn. It is not that interesting, intrinsically (at least for most 
people), because there is no story associated with it. It is an accurate 
and useful representation of the objective reality of what is, beyond 
the shadow of a doubt, but it is a struggle to master perception of 
that abstracted sort. 

Conversely, if someone is telling you a story, it attracts your 
attention immediately. It can be a complicated and cognitively 
difficult story—something requiring hours of concentration. It 
might even be the story of how the periodic table of the elements 
was discovered, and the triumphs and difficulties that accompanied 
the process. It does not matter. If it is well told, it is gripping, and 
likely to be remembered. If you want to teach a child something and 
get them to attend, tell them a story. They will repeatedly ask you to 
do that. They do not grab your pant leg and beg, “Dad, one more line 
from the periodic table of the elements before bed!” But they are 
highly motivated to hear a story—sometimes even the same one 
every night. That is an indication of the depth and importance of 


stories. You might think the story is simple, but your child, listening 
intently, is processing the multiple levels of meaning represented in 
any decent tale—meanings of which you are very unlikely to be 
aware, if the story you are telling is traditional and deep. 

We are all human. That means there is something about our 
experience that is the same. Otherwise, we would not all be human. 
We would not even be able to communicate. To communicate, 
paradoxically, there must be things about you and others that can go 
without saying. Imagine telling someone, “I got really angry this 
morning.” If there is any indication you want the conversation to 
continue and they are agreeable, they might ask you why; but they 
are not likely to ask you, “What do you mean, ‘angry’?” They do not 
ask the latter question because they already know, from their own 
experience, what “angry” means. It can be assumed, rather than 
explained. In fact, the only reason you can talk about anything at all 
is because there are some things you do not ever have to talk about. 
You can just take them for granted. We know, worldwide, for 
example, that there are basic sets of emotions shared by all humans 
—and by many animals.* Everyone understands a growling mother 
bear standing in front of her cubs, teeth bared for all to see. It is 
those things that you do not have to talk about that most precisely 
make us human, that constitute the essence, mutable though it 
remains through the actions of society and environment. 

So, on to the story—to the story of the story, in fact. We will begin 
by meeting the characters whose existence universally structures 
our understanding of the potential of the world. And, with luck, as 
you meet them, you will begin to understand their relationship to 
resentment, arrogance, and deceit well enough so that 
understanding will offer you some protection. 


THE ETERNAL CHARACTERS OF THE HUMAN DRAMA 


THE DRAGON OF CHAOS 
When my son, Julian, was about four years old, he watched the 
movie Pinocchio obsessively—particularly the sequence that 


portrays the whale, Monstro, transforming into a fire-breathing 
dragon. He must have seen it fifty times. And it was not obvious 
that he enjoyed it. He was clearly afraid of the climactic scene. I 
could see it on his face. He had good reason for his fear. The 
characters he had come to identify with had laid it all on the line. 
There was a strong motif of danger and sacrifice. Nonetheless, it 
was the scene that fascinated him the most. 

What in the world was he doing, watching the film repeatedly? 
Particularly if the emotion it produced was fear? Why would a child 
voluntarily subject himself to that? Julian was using all the faculties 
of his newly forming mind, rational and unconscious alike, to 
process the relationships in such a tale. Pinocchio and tales like it 
are dense, layered, and complex in ways that seize the imagination 
of children and will not let go. That is not accidental. Kids are small 
and young and, in some ways, they do not know anything, because 
they have very little personal experience. But they are also very 
ancient creatures, in another manner, and by no means stupid or 
inattentive. The fact that they are gripped by fairy tales and stories 
like Pinocchio is an indication of just how much depth children 
perceive in those stories, even if you, as an adult observer, do not 
notice it anymore. 

That whale is the Dragon of Chaos. This is the symbolic 
representation of potential, of possibility, for better and for worse. 
Representations of this figure appear everywhere, and children see 
them, even if they have no idea what those figures mean. In the 
Disney classic Sleeping Beauty, for example, the Evil Queen, 
Maleficent, entraps Prince Phillip. She chains him in her castle 
dungeon and tells him a charming fairy tale of sorts. She delights in 
describing to him the ruined and ancient man he will be, six or 
seven decades in the future, when she deigns to release him from 
his cell. She portrays him as nothing but the parody of a hero, and 
has a fine time doing so, locking the door to his prison cell on her 
departure, climbing the stairs back to her palace, laughing evilly all 
the while. She is the classic devouring Oedipal mother, preventing 
her son from manifesting his destiny by refusing to allow him to 
leave home. 


The prince escapes from the dungeon, with the help of the 
positive feminine: three helpful fairies, who are clearly the mythical 
counterparts to Maleficent. The Evil Queen sees him mount his 
horse and make his dangerous way through her army, across her 
crumbling, quickly closing drawbridges, and down the road leading 
outside the would-be death trap of her castle. With ever-increasing 
dismay, she leaps from turret to turret, until she makes her way to 
the uppermost place. There she stands, enraged, calling up the fires 
of hell themselves, and transforms herself into a gigantic, fire- 
breathing dragon. Everyone viewing the movie accepts that as a 
given: “Of course the Evil Queen turns into a dragon. There is no 
problem with that.” Why, exactly, is that universally acceptable? On 
the face of it, the transformation makes no sense at all. One 
moment, she is standing, a perfectly understandable although 
exceedingly irritated Evil Queen. Next, she spins around a few times 
and—poof!—she is a gigantic fire-breathing reptile. Perhaps you are 
all thinking as you read this, “Why are you making an issue of this? 
Even my four-year-old understands that!” I do not have a problem 
with an Evil Queen turning into a dragon. It is so self-evident that it 
can happen even in the middle of a popular movie and be accepted 
at face value—so self-evident that it is very difficult to draw people’s 
attention to the idea that something very strange has happened. 

However, if Queen Elizabeth II suddenly turned into a giant fire- 
breathing lizard in the midst of one of her endless galas, a certain 
amount of consternation would be both appropriate and expected. 
People—even monarchs of a great kingdom—do not just transform 
into dangerous reptiles and attack their guests (well, not at most 
parties). But if it happens within the context of a story, then we 
accept it. That does not explain the mystery, however. Not just any 
old transformation can happen within a story. It would not have 
made any sense if Maleficent had donned a sparkly pink outfit and 
begun to cast roses on the pathway Prince Phillip galloped down to 
escape his confinement. That was not in Maleficent’s nature, nor in 
the set of narrative expectations that every audience implicitly 
brings to every movie (and is unlikely to appreciate having 
disrupted, unless done with exceptional finesse and higher-order 


purpose). But it is no problem for her to become a dragon. Why? It 
is partly because nature can and constantly does revert from her 
dangerous but still understandable guise into total chaos. This 
happens, for example, when the campfire we just built to cook our 
hot dogs and sit around singing campfire songs catches a sudden 
gust of hot, dry air and the long-parched forest hypothetically 
sheltering our tents ignites into a raging inferno. Dangers we can 
handle can suddenly turn themselves into dangers we cannot 
handle. That is why it is no surprise to anyone when the Evil Queen 
becomes the Dragon of Chaos. 

Imagine, for a moment, that you are a prehistoric protohuman 
being. You are camped for the night, and that site is defined 
territory—safety and predictability, for the time. Your friends are 
there, your tribal kin. You have your spears. You have your fire. It is 
safe—or at least what passes for safe under such conditions. But if 
you carelessly wander a mere two hundred feet away from the 
campfire, then something horrible with teeth and scales eats you. 
That is what is out there in the terrible unknown. That idea is 
deeply embedded inside of us. We know that human beings are 
innately afraid of reptilian predators, for example—and that there is 
good reason for that. It is not merely that we are prepared to learn 
fear of them (which we certainly are): the fear itself is innate.* For 
all intents and purposes, there is an image that exists inside of us of 
the terrible hunter that lurks in the night. That is why children 
become afraid of the dark once they are old enough to move around 
by themselves.* “There is a monster in the dark, Dad!” they insist, at 
nighttime. And Dad assures his son or daughter that there is no 
such thing as a monster. Well, the adult is wrong, and the child is 
exactly right. There might not be a monster in that particular 
section of the dark, right now, but that is of small comfort when you 
are three feet high and tasty, and there could be—will be—a monster 
there in the future. That is why it might be of more use to let your 
child know directly and through your own actions that there is 
always something sinister and dangerous in the dark, and that it is 
the job of the well-prepared individual to confront it and take the 


treasure it archetypally guards. It is something that an adult and 
child can act out with great results. 

About a year and a half before his encounter with Pinocchio, I 
took Julian to the Boston Science Museum. There was a 
Tyrannosaurus rex skeleton there. It was impressively large, as far 
as I was concerned. But it was even larger, from his perspective. He 
would not get closer than 100 feet. At 150 feet, his curiosity drove 
him forward. But things came to a stop when we got closer. That 
was a neurological phenomenon, too. His curiosity drove him 
forward, toward the monster, so he could collect some useful 
information—until the fear froze him. I could see exactly where that 
boundary lay. Maybe it defined how far away he would need to be to 
remain safe if that thing suddenly whipped its head around to grab 
him. 

There is an idea embedded deep within the human psyche that 
potential can be a place of maximal horror, home to an infinite 
predator—or an infinite variety of predators. Practically speaking, it 
is true, as human beings have been prey animals since the 
beginning of time, although we made it very difficult for the 
predators once we effectively armed and banded together. 
(Personally, I am happy about that. I have camped where the grizzly 
bears were plentiful. It is nice that they are on the planet and all 
that, but I prefer my grizzlies shy, not too hungry, and far enough 
away to be picturesque.) But there are spiritual and psychological 
forces operating in a predatory manner that can destroy you, as well 
—and they can present an even greater danger. The malevolence in 
the heart of people that makes them criminal falls into that 
category, as does the evil that drives the totalitarian war of revenge, 
rapine, greed, or sheer love of blood and destruction. And that 
malevolence also exists in your heart, and that is the greatest 
dragon of all—just as mastering that malevolence constitutes the 
greatest and unlikeliest of individual achievements. 

You are built, neurologically, to interpret the world in this 
dramatic manner, at a very deep level. An ancient part of your brain 
known as the hypothalamus®—a small region, sitting atop the spinal 
cord—regulates many of the fundamental responses that find their 


expression in the conceptualization of danger and potential. One of 
its two modules is responsible for self-preservation (hunger, thirst, 
and, most important for our purposes, defensive aggression in the 
face of threat) as well as reproduction (sexual arousal and basic 
sexual behavior). The second is responsible for exploration.” Half of 
the hypothalamus drives our use of what has been explored 
previously to quell and satisfy the basic demands of life, including 
our capability to protect ourselves in the case of attack. The other 
half is always asking, What is out there? What could it be used for? 
How might it be dangerous? What are its habits? So, what is the 
story? Eat, drink, and be merry, until the provisions run out—but 
watch out, always, for the monsters. Then venture out into the 
dangerous but promising unknown world and discover what is 
there. Why? Well, you already know a lot of things you need to 
know, although you do not know nearly enough. You understand 
that, because life is not as good as it could be, and because you are 
going to die. Obviously, under such conditions, you should learn 
more. So, you are driven to explore. The fundamental 
representation of reality, as an eternal treasure house guarded by an 
eternal predator, is therefore a perfect representation of the way you 
are wired to react to the world at the most fundamental depths of 
your Being. 


NATURE: CREATION AND DESTRUCTION 


We all have an image of nature. It might be an image akin to a 
beautiful landscape—nature as benevolent and renewing. It is an 
image of that kind that grounds the sentimental environmentalist 
view of the world. Being from Northern Alberta, I do not share 
exactly the same view of nature, since up in my hometown of 
Fairview nature was constantly conspiring either to freeze its 
inhabitants to death for six months of the year, and to devour them 
with insects for at least two more. So that is the less romantic part 
of nature, which is red in tooth and claw. That is the part of nature 
that is associated with injury, disease, death, insanity, and 


everything else that can and will befall you, as a biological creature, 
on the negative end of the continuum. 

There is the potential of the future that has not yet been 
transformed into reality (represented, as we have seen, by the 
Dragon of Chaos). But then there is the nature you encounter 
directly in your life, and which cannot be considered absolutely 
unknown. There is the benevolence of nature: the fact that you are 
here, alive—and sometimes happy; the fact that there is delicious 
food to eat, and attractive, interesting people to interact with, and 
no shortage of fascinating things to see and do. There are amazing 
vistas of landscape. There is the beauty and immortality and 
immensity of the ocean. There is all the bountiful, wondrous 
element of natural Being. But there is also the absolute horror that 
goes along with that: destruction, disease, suffering, and death. 
Those two elements of experience exist side by side. It is even the 
case that the former could not exist without the latter: even within 
your own body, healthy as it may be, a very delicate balance between 
the death of every cell that has outlasted its utility and the new life 
that springs forward to replace it is a prerequisite for your 
continued existence. 

Both these elements of existence manifest themselves in our 
imagination in personified form. One is the Evil Queen, the 
Goddess of Destruction and Death; the other is her positive 
counterpart, the Fairy Godmother, the benevolent monarch, the 
young and loving mother watching with infinite care over her 
helpless charge. To live properly, you need to be acquainted with 
both these figures. If you are a child, abused by your mother, 
familiar only with the Evil Queen, then you are damaged by the 
absence of love, stunted by lack of attention, and arbitrarily subject 
to fear and pain and aggression. That is no way to live, and it is very 
difficult to grow up functional and capable and void of distrust, hate, 
and the desire, say, for revenge. You need to find someone to act the 
part of the Benevolent Queen: a friend, a family member, a fictional 
character—or a part of your own psyche, motivated by knowing that 
your mistreatment is wrong, swearing to take any opportunity that 
comes your way to escape your misfortunate circumstances, leave 


them behind, and balance your life appropriately. Maybe the first 
step in this direction is to posit, despite your mistreatment, that you 
are in fact worthy of care; and the second step is to give it, where 
you can, despite receiving tragically little yourself. 

If you understand the polarity of nature, its terror and 
benevolence, you recognize two fundamental elements of 
experience, permanent, eternal, and unavoidable, and you can begin 
to understand, for example, the profound pull toward sacrifice. It is 
a religious trope that sacrifices keep the gods happy, and coming to 
understand just who the unhappy gods are, so to speak, and just 
how terrible they are when they are unhappy is a genuine step 
toward wisdom—a genuine and humbling step. Modern people have 
a hard time understanding what sacrifice means, because they 
think, for example, of a burnt offering on an altar, which is an 
archaic way of acting out the idea. But we have no problem at all 
when we conceptualize sacrifice psychologically, because we all 
know you must forgo gratification in the present to keep the wolf 
from the door in the future. So, you offer something to the negative 
goddess, so that the positive one shows up. You train long, difficult 
hours to be a nurse or a physician or a social worker. That sacrificial 
attitude is in fact the great discovery of the future, conjoined with 
the ability to negotiate and bargain and cope with that future— 
abandon impulsive gratification; let go of something you need and 
want; obtain something valuable in the long run in consequence 
(and keep the horror at bay). You forgo the partying and the easy 
hours. You immerse yourself, instead, in the difficulties of life. You 
do that so that fewer of those difficulties will manifest themselves— 
for yourself, employed gainfully as you will become, and for all the 
others you will help as the strength you developed through proper 
sacrifice makes itself manifest. We are always bargaining in that 
manner. We act out the belief that we can strike a bargain with the 
structure of reality. Strangely enough, we often can. If you are 
sensible, you do that all the time. You prepare for the worst. You 
prepare for the arrival of the Evil Queen. You do what you have to 
do, knowing about her existence, and you keep her at bay—in 
proportion to your wisdom and in accordance with your luck. And if 


you succeed, Benevolent Nature smiles upon you—until she does 
not. But at least you have some control over the situation. You are 
not a sitting duck, or a babe in the woods, or a rube at the 
amusement park—or at least no more so than you have to be. 

Nature is chaos, too, because it is always wreaking havoc with 
culture, its existential opposite—and the next subject of our 
investigation. After all, as Robert Burns has it, “The best laid 
schemes 0’ Mice an’ Men / Gang aft a-gley.” And it is often nature in 
positive and negative guise that does precisely that. It is no easy 
matter to balance the fragility of life and the necessity for 
procreation (and all the uncertainty of pregnancy and birth and 
child-rearing) with the desire for certainty, predictability, and order. 
And this is to say nothing of death (and even cancer is, after all, just 
another form of life). But all that is not to say, ever, that chaos is of 
less value than order. There is nothing but sterility without 
unpredictability, even though a bit less unpredictability often seems 
eminently desirable. 

This nature/chaos combination is often seen in pop culture 
representations. As we mentioned, in the Disney movie Sleeping 
Beauty, for example, there is an Evil Queen—just as there is in The 
Little Mermaid (Ursula), Snow White (Grimhilde), One Hundred 
and One Dalmatians (Cruella de Vil), Cinderella (Lady Tremaine), 
Tangled (Mother Gothel), and Alice in Wonderland (the Queen of 
Hearts). She represents the harsh element of the natural world. The 
example of Sleeping Beauty is, once again, particularly germane. 
Remember what happens at the movie’s opening. The king and 
queen have waited long, and are now desperate to have a baby. The 
blessing arrives; the baby is born and they call her Aurora, the dawn. 
They are all thrilled, and so is the whole kingdom—properly so, 
because new life has arrived. They plan a great christening party. It 
is a fine idea, but they fail to invite Maleficent, the Evil Queen, to 
the celebrations. And it is not ignorance that prevents them. They 
know of her existence, and they are well acquainted with her power. 
It is willful blindness, and it is a bad move. They desire to shield 
their new and precious daughter from the negative element of the 
world, instead of determining how to provide her with the strength 


and wisdom to prevail, despite the reality of the negative. All this 
does is keep Aurora naive and vulnerable. Maleficent shows up 
anyway, as she most certainly will, and there is a message in that: 
invite the Evil Queen to your child’s life. If you fail to do so, your 
children will grow up weak and in need of protection, and the Evil 
Queen is going to make herself known no matter what steps you 
take to stop her. At the christening, in fact, not only does she arrive, 
well behaved but uninvited, but she offers a present (in the form of 
a curse): the death of Aurora at the age of sixteen, brought about by 
the prick of the spindle of a spinning wheel. And all that because 
she was not invited to celebrate the young princess’s christening. 
Only because a compassionate and powerful guest intercedes—one 
of the three aforementioned fairies, representative of the positive 
feminine—is the curse transmuted from death into profound 
unconsciousness, a state barely less fatal. 

That is what happens to those beauties, so to speak, who remain 
far too unawakened when they hit sixteen: They do not want to be 
conscious, because they have not developed the courage and ability 
to face the negative element of the natural world. Instead of being 
encouraged, they have been sheltered. And if you shelter young 
people, you destroy them. You did not invite the Evil Queen, even 
for short visits. What are your children going to do when she shows 
up in full force, if they are entirely unprepared? They are not going 
to want to live. They are going to long for unconsciousness. And it 
gets worse. If you overprotect your kids, you become the very thing 
from which you are trying to shelter them. Depriving them of their 
young lives’ necessary adventures, you weaken their characters. You 
become the Destroying Agent itself—the very witch that devours 
their autonomous consciousness. 

I had a client many years ago who was a real-life version of 
Sleeping Beauty. She was tall, blonde haired, razor thin (as the 
saying goes), and profoundly unhappy. She was enrolled in a local 
junior college, attempting to upgrade so that she could attend 
university. She came to see me because she did not want to live. She 
also did not want to die, really—at least not actively. Instead, she 
attempted to keep herself unconscious with the use of Valium and 


its variants, including sleeping pills, which she procured in 
sufficient quantities from her (several) physicians, who were no 
doubt overworked enough not to keep track of exactly what she was 
doing. She managed to keep herself asleep fifteen or sixteen hours a 
day. She was smart and literate, and showed me a philosophy essay 
she had written on the pointlessness not only of her life but life in 
general. She was unable to tolerate the responsibility, by all 
appearances, but also could not deal with the cruelty she saw 
everywhere around her. She was a vegan, for example, and that was 
directly associated with her acute physical terror of life. She was 
unable even to enter the aisles of a supermarket where meat was 
displayed. Where others saw the cuts they were going to prepare for 
their family, she saw rows of dead body parts. That vision only 
served to confirm her belief that life was, in essence, unbearable. 
Her biological mother had died in childbirth, and she was raised 
by her father and her stepmother. The latter was a holy terror. I met 
her only once, in my office, during what would have ordinarily been 
a clinical session with her stepdaughter. She spent the entire hour 
actively tearing strips off me: first for being of little use as a 
clinician, and second for “no doubt” blaming everything that was 
wrong with my client on her (step)mothering. I do not think I got 
more than a dozen words in edgewise. It was a remarkable 
performance, brought on, I believe, by my insistence that the phone 
calls she made two or three times a day to my client while the latter 
was away at school—some of which I heard in recordings—had to be 
reduced by a factor of ten, and certainly needed to be more pleasant. 
I am not saying and did not believe then that all this was the 
stepmother’s fault. I am sure she had her reasons to be frustrated. 
Her stepdaughter was not fully engaged in life, by any means, and 
was an expensive four underperforming years into what should 
have been a two-year certificate. But it was clear that thrice-daily 
phone calls consisting mostly of anger and insults were not adding 
to my client’s desire to be alive. I suggested that weekly phone calls 
should become the norm, and encouraged her to hang up if the 
conversation took a wicked turn. She started to put that into 


practice, and I presumed all that contributed to her stepmother’s 
demand to meet and confront me. 

Sleeping Beauty described her childhood as idyllic. She said that 
she lived the life of a fairy-tale princess; an only child, the darling of 
both parents. But that all changed when she hit adolescence. Her 
stepmother’s attitude changed from trust to deep distrust, and they 
began the fights that continually characterized their relationship 
from then on (she was in her early thirties when I met her). The 
problem of sex had reared its ugly head. The stepmother responded 
by acting as if her innocent child had been replaced by a corrupt 
impostor; the stepdaughter responded by dating a series of ne’er-do- 
wells whom at one level she probably thought she deserved (having 
lost the perfect innocence of the child princess) and at another 
constituted the perfect punishment for her mother. 

Together, we designed an exposure-training program to help her 
overcome her fear of life. We first undertook to visit a nearby 
butcher shop. The shop owner and I had become friendly 
acquaintances over the years. After I explained my client’s situation 
to him (with her permission), I asked if I could bring her into his 
store, show her the meat counter, and then—when she was ready— 
bring her to the back to watch as his team cut up the carcasses that 
were delivered through the alleyway loading dock. He quickly 
agreed. Our initial goal was merely to get to the store together. I 
assured her that we could pause at any time, or stop altogether, and 
that under no conditions would I trick, entice, or even cajole her 
into pushing her beyond what she could tolerate. During the first 
session, she managed to enter the store and place her hand on the 
display case. She did it shaking and in visible tears (also no easy 
thing to manage in public), but she did it. By the fourth session, she 
was able to watch the butchers use their knives and saws on the 
large and still animal-like carcasses they were slicing into the 
standard cuts they sold. There was no doubt that this was good for 
her. She was less inclined, for example, to medicate herself into 
unconsciousness and more likely to attend classes. She became 
tougher, harder, harsher—adjectives that are not always meant as 
compliments but are sometimes the precise antidote to too much 


sentimentality, which is dangerously infantilizing. We also made 
arrangements for her to spend a weekend at a local farm where a 
few common barnyard animals were kept (pigs, horses, chickens, 
goats). I asked the farmer, who had also been a client of mine, to 
allow her to accompany him while he attended to his livestock. A 
city girl to the core, my client knew nothing whatsoever about 
animals, and tended, in consequence, to romanticize them, in 
exactly the fairy-tale manner appropriate to the conditions of her 
childhood. Her two-day sojourn in the country and her decision to 
observe the animals carefully helped her develop a much less 
romanticized perception of the true nature of the animals we raise 
and dine upon. They are sentient beings, in part, and we have a 
responsibility not to inflict any more suffering upon them than 
necessary, but they are not human beings, and they are certainly not 
children. This needs to be understood at an embodied level. Excess 
sentimentality is an illness, a developmental failure, and a curse to 
children and others who need our care (but not too much of it). 

Sleeping Beauty was a remarkable dreamer. I have had clients 
who would commonly remember two or three dreams a night, 
though not always in great detail. She not only remembered many 
dreams, but remembered them fully, and she also often became 
lucid—conscious of dreaming—while she slept. She was the only 
person I ever met who could ask her dream characters what they 
meant—symbolically speaking—or what message they had for her, 
and they would tell her outright. One day she came to me with one 
of her many dreams: She had journeyed alone deep into the depths 
of an old-growth forest and met a dwarf dressed like a harlequin in 
the darkness and gloom. The dwarf offered to answer a question, if 
my client had one to ask. She asked the strange figure what she 
would have to do to finish her college certificate, a task that had 
taken her the four aforementioned years and plenty of negotiation 
with the requisite university authorities for permission to continue. 
The answer she received? “You will have to learn to work in a 
slaughterhouse.” 

Now, as far as I am concerned, dreams are statements from 
nature. It is not so much that we create them. They manifest 


themselves to us. I have never seen a dream present something I 
believed to be untrue. I also do not believe—contra Freud—that 
dreams attempt to disguise what they mean. They are, instead, an 
earlier part of the process by which fully developed thoughts come 
to be born, as they certainly do not just appear magically out of 
nowhere. We must confront the unknown, as such—the great 
Dragon of Chaos or the Terrible Queen—and we do not know how to 
do it, to begin with. The dream serves as the first cognitive step—in 
the wake of basic emotional, motivational, and bodily reactions such 
as fear or curiosity or freezing—in transforming that unknown into 
actionable and even articulable knowledge. The dream is the 
birthplace of the thought, and often of the thought that does not 
come easily to the conscious mind. It is not hiding anything; it is 
just not very good at being clear (although that certainly does not 
mean that it cannot be profound). 

In any case, this dream was not difficult to interpret, particularly 
because its main character, the dwarf, simply spoke his mind. So, I 
listened carefully to my client’s account (remember, this was after 
the butcher shop and the farm) and asked her what we might do 
about that. I had no idea how I might arrange a visit to an actual 
slaughterhouse. I did not even know if they existed in the city we 
inhabited, and if they did, I could not imagine they would appreciate 
visitors, regardless of motivation. She was convinced, however, that 
she had been told the truth, and that something of the sort had to be 
done. So we discussed the consequences of her toughening up, and 
the fact that she had successfully put her hypercritical stepmother 
on the back burner, and left it at that for the remainder of the 
session, although she was tasked (as was I) with determining 
something that might serve as a reasonable substitute for a 
slaughterhouse. 

A week later, she returned for her scheduled session. She 
announced the last thing, perhaps, that I could have possibly 
imagined from her—or anyone else, for that matter: “I think I need 
to see an embalming.” I did not know what to say. I did not want to 
see an embalming, personally—not at all. I had seen body sections 
in science museums, and there was something about them that 


refused to leave my memory. I had also gone to see one of the 
displays of plasticized, sculptured bodies that were so popular about 
a decade ago, and I was horrified by it. I became a psychologist, not 
a surgeon—or, for that matter, a coroner—for a reason. However, 
this was not about me. It was about my client, Sleeping Beauty, and 
her desire to awaken, and there was no way I was going to let my 
wishes or lack thereof interfere with whatever wisdom the dwarf 
who inhabited the deep forest of her unconscious mind was about 
to impart. I told her I would see what I could do. It all turned out to 
be much simpler to arrange than I expected. I simply picked up the 
phone and called a local mortician’s office. To my great surprise, he 
immediately agreed. I suppose he had seen his fair share of people 
grieving and frightened, and was accustomed to dealing with them 
calmly and wisely. So that was that. I was stuck with the visit, and 
my client wanted to go through with it. 

Two weeks later, we went to the funeral home. My client had 
asked me if a friend could attend with her, and I said yes. The 
mortician offered the three of us a tour first. He showed us the 
chapel and the display room for the caskets. We asked him how he 
managed his job, given its endless concentration on death and 
suffering and grief. He said that it was his heartfelt responsibility to 
make his clients’ most terrible of times the least painful they could 
be, and that he took heart from that. That made sense to both of us, 
and helped us understand how he could continue with his work, day 
in and out. After the tour, we went to the embalming room. It was a 
small space, perhaps a hundred feet square. The naked body of an 
aged man was lying motionless, gray, and mottled on a stainless- 
steel table. Because there was not space in the small room, and to 
provide us both with some distance, my client, her friend, and I took 
our places in the hallway immediately outside the door and 
observed the proceedings, which were entirely unimpeded by our 
trivial separation from the mortician’s operations. He drained the 
blood and other liquids from the body. They ran undramatically but 
in some sense all the more horribly for that, because of their 
mundane mode of disposal, I suppose. It seemed like something 
that precious and vital deserved better. He made his surgical 


alterations, and sewed together the eyelids, and made up the face, 
and injected the embalming fluid. I watched. And I watched my 
client. To begin with, she looked down the hallway, avoiding the 
scene unfolding in front of her. But as the minutes ticked by, she 
started to glance at the proceedings, and by the time a quarter of an 
hour had passed, she was spending far more time observing than 
looking away. I could see, however, that she had taken her friend’s 
hand, and was gripping it tightly. 

She was seeing firsthand that something she had believed would 
terrify her (and reasonably so) was not in fact doing so. She could 
manage the experience. She did not panic, become ill, run away, or 
even cry. She asked the mortician if she could put a hand on the 
body. He offered her a rubber glove, which she pulled on. She 
walked directly into the operating station, in a quiet and meditative 
state, and placed her gloved hand on the ribs of the body, and she 
kept it there, as if it was a comfort both to her and the poor departed 
soul. The procedure terminated soon after that, and we left quietly 
together, after offering the mortician our genuine and heartfelt 
thanks. 

The three of us expressed our shared astonishment that we had 
managed such a visit. My client had learned something vitally 
important about her tolerance for the terrors of life. Equally 
importantly, she had a reference point for her fears: from that point 
onward (and I am by no means claiming complete success in her 
treatment) she had something truly awe inspiring—something truly 
serious and horrifying and graphic and real—to compare with the 
other, almost inevitably lesser, horrors of life. Were the mundane 
miseries of existence as challenging as the experience she had put 
herself through voluntarily? Was the butcher shop more frightening 
than human death, in all its reality, at such close proximity? Had 
she not demonstrated to herself that she could encounter the worst 
that Terrible Nature could throw at her and face it courageously? 
And that was to her a paradoxical and ineradicable source of 
comfort. 

As with the Sleeping Beauty of fairy tales, my client’s family had 
failed to invite the Evil Queen, the terrible aspect of nature, into 


their child’s life. This left her completely unprepared for life’s 
essential harshness—the complications of sexuality and the 
requirement for everything that lives to devour other lives (and to 
be eventually subjected to the same fate). The Evil Queen made her 
reappearance at puberty—in the form of my client’s stepmother, 
whose character apparently turned 180 degrees—as well as in her 
own personal inability to deal with the responsibilities of maturity 
and stark obligations of biological survival. Like Sleeping Beauty, as 
well—as that tale is multistoried and deep in the way of ancient fairy 
tales, which can be thousands of years old—she needed to be 
awakened by the forces of exploration, courage, and fortitude (often 
represented by the redeeming prince, but which she found within 
herself). 


CULTURE: SECURITY AND TYRANNY 


If the Dragon of Chaos and the paired Benevolent and Evil Queen 
are representatives of potential and of the unknown, the Wise King 
and the Authoritarian Tyrant are representatives of the structures, 
social and psychological, that enable us to overlay structure on that 
potential. We interpret the present through the lens of culture. We 
plan for the future by attempting to bring into being what we have 
been taught and what we have determined, personally, to value. All 
of that seems good, but a too-rigid approach to understanding what 
is currently in front of us and what we should pursue can blind us to 
the value of novelty, creativity, and change. When the structures 
that guide us are merely secure, rather than inflexible, we leaven 
our desire for routine and predictability with the curiosity that 
makes us attracted to and appreciative of what remains outside our 
conceptual schemes. When those same structures degenerate into 
stasis, we run from and deny the existence of what we do not yet 
understand and what we have not yet encountered, and this means 
that we make ourselves unable to change when change is required. 
Understanding that both possibilities exist is of crucial importance 
to establish the balance that is required in life. 


We could use a poetic metaphor to represent the elements of 
experience that we have so far discussed (this is in fact how the 
world I am describing is usually considered). Imagine the realm of 
the Dragon of Chaos as the night sky, stretching infinitely above you 
on a clear night, representing what will remain forever outside your 
domain of understanding. Maybe you are standing on a beach, 
looking up, lost in contemplation and imagination. Then you turn 
your attention to the ocean—as grand in its way as the starry 
cosmos, but tangible and manifest and knowable, comparatively 
speaking. That is nature. It is not mere potential. It is there, in its 
unknowability, instead of removed from comprehension entirely. It 
is not yet tamed, however; not brought into the domain of order. 
And it is beautiful in its mystery. The moon reflects on its surface; 
the waves crash eternally and lull you to sleep; you can swim in its 
welcoming waters. But that beauty has a price. You better keep an 
eye out for sharks. And poisonous jellyfish. And the riptide that can 
pull you or your children under. And the storms that could destroy 
your warm and welcoming beach house. 

Imagine, further, that the beach on which you stand is the shore 
of an island. The island is culture. People live there—perhaps in 
harmony and peace, under a benevolent ruler; perhaps in a war-torn 
hell of oppression, hunger, and privation. And that is culture: Wise 
King or Authoritarian Tyrant. It is of vital necessity to become 
acquainted with both characters, just as in the case of Evil Queen 
and Benevolent Goddess, to ensure the appropriate balance in 
attitude required to adapt properly to the vicissitudes of life. Too 
much emphasis on the Wise King blinds those who hold that 
attitude to the injustice and unnecessary suffering that is a 
consequence of the inevitable flaws in our all-too-human social 
structures. Too much insistence on the Authoritarian Tyrant means 
lack of appreciation for the often fragile structures that bind us 
together and protect us from the chaos that would otherwise 
certainly reign. 

The ideological systems we are prone to adopting—the systems 
that so polarize us, politically and personally, can be profitably 
understood in light of the present conceptualization. They are 


cultural narratives usefully considered as parasites upon a more 
fundamental religious, mythological, or dramatic substructure— 
ancient, evolved, and deeply biological in its nature. Ideologies take 
on the structure of a story that is essentially religious, but they do 
so incompletely, including certain elements of experience or eternal 
characters while ignoring others. The power remains in the 
representation, nonetheless, because what is included retains its 
fundamentally mythological/biological nature—its instinctual 
meaning—but the missing elements mean that what remains, 
however powerful in its expression, is biased in a way that restricts 
its utility. That bias is desirable subjectively, as it simplifies what 
would otherwise be too complex to understand, but dangerous 
because of its one-sidedness. If the map you are using is missing 
part of the world, you are going to be utterly unprepared when that 
absent element makes itself manifest. How is it possible for us to 
retain the advantages of simplification, without falling prey to the 
accompanying blindness? The answer is to be found in the constant 
dialogue between genuinely different types of people. 

Much of what people believe politically—ideologically, let us say— 
is based on their inborn temperament. If their emotions or 
motivations tend to tilt one way (and much of that is a consequence 
of biology), then they tend to adopt, say, a conservative or liberal 
tendency. It is not a matter of opinion. Imagine, instead, that 
animals have a niche—a place or space that suits them. Their 
biology is matched to that place. Lions are not found in the open 
ocean, and killer whales do not roam the African veldt. The animal 
and its environment are of a piece. 

Human beings are similar, at least in the realm of abstraction. We 
are nonetheless capable of making ourselves at home almost 
everywhere, geographically, because we change the geography, as 
necessary, as well as modify our own behavior. But we have 
perceptual or cognitive niches. Liberals, for example, are positively 
enthralled by new ideas. The advantages to being attracted by new 
ideas are obvious. Sometimes problems require new solutions, and 
it is people who take pleasure in novel conceptions who find them. 
Such people also tend not to be particularly orderly.® Perhaps this is 


because if you are gripped and driven by new ideas, and are also 
inclined to test or implement them, you need to be able to tolerate 
the intermediary chaos produced between the time the old idea 
disintegrates and the new idea takes control. If you are a 
conservative, you have the opposite advantage and problem. You are 
wary of new ideas, and not particularly attracted to them, and that is 
in part because you are less sensitive to their possibilities and more 
concerned about their unpredicted consequences. Just because a 
new idea fixes one problem, after all, does not mean that it will fail 
to generate another, or several others. If you are conservative, you 
like things to be where they are supposed to be, when they are 
supposed to be there. You are in the place you want to be when 
people act conventionally, responsibly, and predictably. 

Conservatives are necessary for maintaining things the way they 
are when everything is working and change might be dangerous. 
Liberals, by contrast, are necessary for changing things when they 
are no longer working. It is no easy task, however, to determine 
when something needs to be preserved or when it needs to be 
transformed. That is why we have politics, if we are fortunate, and 
the dialogue that accompanies it, instead of war, tyranny, or 
submission. It is necessary for us to argue vociferously and 
passionately about the relative value of stability versus change, so 
that we can determine when each is appropriate and in what doses. 

It is of great interest to note that difference in fundamental 
political belief appears to determine which of the twinned Great 
Fathers are considered of fundamental reality. The liberal tends 
strongly to see the world as the Authoritarian Tyrant suppressing 
the Benevolent Goddess—as the arbitrary strictures of dead culture 
corrupting and oppressing citizen and foreigner alike, or as the 
military-industrial structure of modern society threatening Gaia, 
the living planet, with pollution, mass extinction, or climate change. 
Such a viewpoint is obviously useful when culture has become truly 
tyrannical—and that is by no means uncommon. The conservative 
tends, conversely, to see the world as Wise King—security of place, 
order, and predictability—bringing to heel, taming and disciplining 
the Evil Queen—nature as disorder and chaos. That is obviously 


necessary as well. No matter how beautiful the natural world, we 
should remember that it is always conspiring to starve, sicken, and 
kill us, and that if we lacked the protective shield constituted by 
Culture as Security we would be devoured by wild animals, frozen 
by blizzards, prostrated by the heat of the desert, and starved by the 
fact that food does not simply manifest itself for our delectation. So 
there are two different ideologies—both of which are “correct,” but 
each of which tell only half the story.* 

To develop a properly balanced view of the world of experience, it 
is necessary to accept the reality of both elements of culture. Those 
with a conservative bent, drawn temperamentally to regard the 
status quo as protective, must to come to understand that mere 
order is insufficient. Because the future and the present differ from 
the past, what worked before will not necessarily work now, and it is 
necessary to understand that the line between the stability 
bequeathed to us by our ancestors and the tyranny that can so easily 
become shifts and moves with the transformations of existence. 
Equally, however, the more liberal types, prone to see the 
Authoritarian Tyrant everywhere, must work to develop gratitude 
for the social and psychological structures of interpretation that 
continually shield us from the terrors of nature and the absolute 
unknown. It is difficult for any of us to see what we are blinded to 
by the nature of our personalities. It is for this reason that we must 
continually listen to people who differ from us, and who, because of 
that difference, have the ability to see and to react appropriately to 
what we cannot detect. 


THE INDIVIDUAL: HERO AND ADVERSARY 


If the night sky is chaos, the ocean nature, and the island culture, 
then the individual—hero and adversary—is one brother locked in 
combat with his twin in the middle of the isle. Chaos, treasure and 
dragon, have their negative and positive element, as do Nature—Evil 
Queen and Benevolent Mother—and Culture—Authoritarian Tyrant 
and Wise King. No less the individual. The positive element is the 


heroic aspect: the person who can sacrifice properly to nature and 
strike a bargain with fate such that benevolence reigns; the person 
who is awake, alert, attentive, communicative, and bears 
responsibility, so that the tyrannical part of the state remains at bay; 
and the person who is aware of his or her own faults and proclivity 
for malevolence and deceit, so that proper orientation is 
maintained. The negative element is everything despicable and 
contemptible—particularly evident in yourself, if you have any 
sense, but also manifested to some degree by other people and 
(more clearly) in stories. Those are the hostile brothers, a very old 
mythological idea: the hero and the adversary. The archetypal 
representations of those two forces, those two personified figures, 
are Cain and Abel. That is one level of representation. Christ and 
Satan are a pair representing an even more fundamental duality. 
Cain and Abel, after all, are human (the first humans, born in the 
human manner, as Adam and Eve were created directly by God). 
Christ and Satan are elements of personified (deified?) eternity 
itself. 

So, there exists a hero and an adversary; a wise king and a tyrant; 
a positive and negative maternal figure; and chaos itself. That is the 
structure of the world in six characters (with the strange seventh of 
chaos in some sense the ultimate birthplace of all the others). It is 
necessary to understand that all seven exist, and that they are all 
existential permanents—elements of experience with which every 
soul, rich, poor, blessed, cursed, talented, dull, male, and female 
must inevitably contend. That is life—they are life. Partial 
knowledge of the cast, conscious or unconscious, leaves you 
undefended; leaves you naive, unprepared, and likely to become 
possessed by deceit, resentment, and arrogance. If you do not know 
that the treasure is guarded by a dragon, or that nature, beautiful 
nature, can turn its teeth on you in an instant, or that the peaceful 
society you take for granted is threatened constantly by 
authoritarianism and tyranny, or that you contain within yourself 
the adversary who might wish that all those negative 
transformations occur, then you are, first, a needy acolyte for an 
ideology that will provide you with a partial and insufficient 


representation of reality; and, second, someone blind in a manner 
dangerous to themselves and others alike. If you are wise, your 
political philosophy encompasses a representation of all seven, even 
if you could not articulate it in those terms. We should always have 
enough sense to keep in mind, for example, that a great predator 
lurks beneath the thin ice of our constructed realities. I remember a 
vision I once had about my then very young daughter, portraying 
exactly that reality. In the winter, in Northern Alberta—where, as I 
said, I grew up—there were years where the snow stayed at bay for 
weeks after the lakes themselves had frozen, smooth, perfectly 
clear, rock hard, barren, and not without beauty and mystery. (A 
stone skipped across their expanse would chime and echo 
melodically as it skidded across the slippery surface.) I imagined my 
daughter Mikhaila—a toddler dressed only in a diaper—sitting at 
some distance from me, directly on the ice. Underneath her, I could 
see a huge fish, a whale shark (although carnivorous, in this 
incarnation)—hanging motionless below her, waiting, upright in the 
water underneath the ice, mouth gaping. That is life, and death, and 
the pure chaos that destroys our hard-won certainties, but it is also 
the prophet-swallowing whale who grants wisdom and rebirth, if it 
does not kill. 

And what is the proper attitude of the hero, let us say, with 
respect to the remaining six characters (assuming we have dealt 
sufficiently with chaos with that last anecdote)? Obviously, we must 
endeavor to preserve Nature, upon whose benevolence we are 
finally dependent for everything that life requires. But it is also 
perfectly worthwhile for us to note and take seriously the fact that 
the same Nature is doing her best to kill us, and that we have every 
reason to erect the structures we do, despite their often unfortunate 
environmental costs.* Something similar applies to culture. We all 
have reason to be grateful, in the main, for the wisdom and the 
structure that our forebears bequeathed to us, to their great cost. 
That does not mean that those benefits are distributed equally, 
because they are not and never will be, no more than the benefits of 
Nature are distributed equally. That gratitude also does not justify 
any willfully blind optimism with regard to the nature of society. As 


individuals—struggling, let us say, against the adversarial tendency 
and the Authoritarian Tyrant simultaneously—we need to be awake 
to the fact that our functional hierarchical structures can become 
unproductive, tyrannical, and blind in the blink of an eye. We have a 
responsibility to ensure that they do not become radically unfair 
and corrupt and begin to distribute their rewards on the basis of 
power or unmeritocratic privilege instead of competence. We must 
attend to them constantly and adjust them carefully so they remain 
sufficiently stable and appropriately dynamic. That is a fundamental 
part of our roles and responsibilities as persons aiming 
courageously at the good. We manage that partly in democratic 
systems by throwing out the people in charge on a regular basis, and 
replacing them with their ideological opposites. That capability and 
opportunity constitutes one of the fundamental achievements of a 
democratic society. In the absence of the ability to regularly choose 
only the wise and good as leaders (and good luck finding them), it is 
worthwhile to elect a pack blind to half of reality in one cycle and 
another blind to the other half the next. Then at least most of 
society's concerns are attended to in some reasonable measure over 
the course of something approximating a decade. 

I think that somewhat pessimistic but also eminently realistic 
strategy is in keeping with the vision of the people who founded the 
American system (and the actions and attitudes of the English and 
other early democrats and parliamentarians whose gradually 
evolving systems laid the groundwork for the explicit claims those 
founders made). They were not utopian in their essential viewpoint. 
They believed that the people who were inevitably to be their 
successors were going to be just as flawed as they were, and just as 
flawed as people before them. What do you do about that, when you 
are not blinded by ideology, and you see the world and all its 
dramatic characters clearly? Well, you do not hope for the infinite 
perfectibility of humanity and aim your system at some 
unattainable utopia. You try to design a system that sinners such as 
you cannot damage too badly—too permanently—even when they 
are half blind and resentful. To the degree that I am conservative in 
orientation, I believe in the wisdom of that vision. I believe that is a 


more appropriate way of looking at things. Let us not get too 
grandiose. We can design systems that allow us a modicum of 
peace, security, and freedom and, perhaps, the possibility of 
incremental improvement. That is a miracle in and of itself. We 
should have the wisdom to doubt that we will produce some 
positive transformation of individual, society, and nature 
simultaneously, particularly if those improvements are to be 
brought about in consequence of our own intrinsic, personal 
goodwill, which is often in too short supply (despite our 
protestations to the contrary). 


RESENTMENT 


Why do you and others fall prey to resentment—that terrible hybrid 
emotional state, an admixture of anger and self-pity, tinged, to 
various degrees, with narcissism and the desire for revenge? Once 
you understand the world as a dramatic forum, and you have 
identified the major players, the reasons become clear. You are 
resentful because of the absolute unknown and its terrors, because 
nature conspires against you, because you are a victim of the 
tyrannical element of culture, and because of the malevolence of 
yourself and other individuals. That is reason enough. It does not 
make your resentment appropriate, but it certainly makes the 
emotion understandable. None of these existential problems are 
trivial. In fact, they are serious enough to make the real question 
not “Why are you resentful?” but “Why is not everyone resentful 
about everything all the time?” We are the focus of unbelievably 
powerful and often malevolent transpersonal forces. There is a 
terrible reptilian predator, metaphorically speaking, pursuing you 
all the time, just like the crocodile with the ticktock of time 
emanating from the clock he swallowed chasing the tyrannical 
coward Captain Hook. And there is nature herself. She is hell-bent 
on doing you in, in a million horrible ways. Then there is the 
tyrannical element of the social structure, which has molded you— 
taught you, so to speak—and made you into the quasi-civilized, 


semi-useful creature that you are, but crushed a tremendous 
amount of life force out of you at the same time, pounding you like 
the proverbial square peg into the round hole. There were many 
things you could have been. Maybe some of them were more than 
you have become. But you were lessened and reduced by the 
demand for social existence. 

And you are stuck with yourself, too, and that is no picnic. You 
procrastinate, you are lazy, you lie, and you do vicious things to 
yourself and others. It is no wonder you feel like a victim, given 
what is arrayed against you: chaos, the brute force of nature, the 
tyranny of culture, and the malevolence of your own nature. It is no 
wonder you might feel resentful. And it is certainly the case that 
these forces are arrayed against some of you in a manner that seems 
far more serious, unjust, arbitrary, continuous, and unpredictable 
than it seems for others. How could you fail to feel victimized and 
resentful under those conditions? Life contains no shortage of 
fundamental brutality. 

There is a problem with this logic, however, inexorable though it 
may seem. The first is that not everyone does in fact construe him 
or herself as a victim and fall prey, in consequence, to resentment— 
and that includes a large proportion of people who have had a very 
hard time in their lives. In fact, I think it is reasonable to posit that 
it is often the people who have had too easy a time—who have been 
pampered and elevated falsely in their self-esteem—who adopt the 
role of victim and the mien of resentment. You can encounter 
people, contrarily, who have been hurt virtually beyond all hope of 
repair who are not resentful and who would never deign to present 
themselves as victims. They are not that common, but they are not 
so very rare either. Thus, resentment does not appear to be an 
inevitable consequence of suffering itself. Other factors are at play, 
in addition to the undeniable tragedy of life. 

Maybe you—or just as tragically, someone close to you—contracts 
a serious illness. It is typical in such circumstances to ask the 
question (of whom? God?) “Why did this have to happen to me?” 
Well, what do you mean? Would you wish it instead upon a friend, 
neighbor, or even a random stranger? You certainly might be 


tempted to spread your misery, but such a response does not seem 
either reasonable or a choice that a good person, thinking clearly, 
would ever make, and it certainly would not make the situation 
more just. To be fair, the question “Why me?” constitutes, in part, a 
psychologically appropriate response. It is often the case that if 
something bad happens to you, you should ask yourself if there is 
something that you have done in the past that has increased the 
probability of the terrible event—as we have discussed at length— 
because it is possible that you have something to learn that would 
decrease the chances of its recurrence. But often that is not at all 
what we are doing. The question “Why did this have to happen to 
me?” frequently contains a reproachful element, based on a sense of 
injustice: “There are all these bad people in the world, and they 
seem to be getting away unpunished for this misbehavior,” or 
“There are all these people in the world who are enjoying good 
health, and it seems singularly unfair for them to be in that 
fortunate position when I am not.” That means that “Why me?” is in 
this manner generally contaminated with a sense of victimization, 
signifying injustice. This false misapprehension that the terrible 
experience that has befallen you somehow singularly characterizes 
you—is aimed, particularly, at you—is part of what turns exposure to 
tragedy into the very resentment we are discussing. 

The fact that unfortunate things are happening or are going to 
happen to you is built into the structure of reality itself. There is no 
doubt that awful things happen, but there is an element of true 
randomness about them. You might think, “That is trivial 
compensation, and of little help.” But some appreciation for the 
random element can be helpful, by distancing the personal element, 
and that can help you erect some barriers to developing that intense 
egotistical resentment. Furthermore, it can be of great utility to 
realize that each of the negatives that characterize human existence 
are balanced, in principle, by their positive counterpart. 

Here is something I have learned in my years as a clinical 
psychologist. I constantly saw people who were hurt by life. They 
had their reasons for feeling resentful, and those reasons were often 
far from trivial. I would propose: “Let us take your problems apart, 


even though many of them are real. We will try to figure out which 
ones are your fault, because some of them are going to be. Some of 
them, alternatively, are just the catastrophe of life. We will 
delineate that very carefully. Then we will start having you practice 
overcoming whatever it is that you are bringing to the situation that 
is making it worse. We will start to make some strategic plans about 
how you might confront the parts of your life that are truly just 
tragic, and we will get you to do that in a truthful, open, and 
courageous manner. Then we will watch what happens.” 

People got better. Not always. Some of my clients even died. We 
would be halfway through their clinical issues, and they would be 
carried off by a sudden cancer or killed in a traffic accident. There is 
no certain path, even with the noblest of actions. The arbitrariness 
of the world is always at the ready, preparing to manifest itself. 
There is no reason or excuse to be stupidly naive or optimistic. But 
most people did get better. Encouragement prepared them to 
confront their problems head-on, and that voluntary confrontation 
dispelled some of their fear. This was not because things around 
them became less dangerous, but because the people facing the 
danger became braver. It is unbelievable how strong and courageous 
people can become. It is miraculous what sort of load people can 
bear when they take it on voluntarily. I know we cannot have an 
infinite capacity for that, but I also believe that it is in some sense 
unlimited. I think the more voluntary confrontation is practiced, the 
more can be borne. I do not know what the upper limit is for that.* 

People not only become encouraged, so they can stave off the 
horror and resentment from a psychological perspective, but they 
also become more able. Not only are they contending with the 
existential burden of life more effectively from a spiritual 
perspective, say, but they start to be better people in the world. They 
start to constrain the malevolence and resentment in their own 
hearts that makes the horror of the world even more dismal than it 
must be. They become more honest. They make better friends. They 
make more productive and meaningful career choices. They start 
aiming higher. Thus, they can cope better, psychologically, but they 
also reduce the volume of what they and the others around them 


must cope with. Then they suffer less unnecessarily, and so do their 
families. Then, maybe, the same thing starts to happen with their 
communities. And then there is the other half of the story: the 
treasure that the dragon hoards, the benevolent element of nature, 
the security and shelter provided by society and culture, and the 
strength of the individual. Those are your weapons in times of 
trouble. And they are just as real, and perhaps of sufficient power, 
that their full use will provide you with the means to cope when 
your life falls apart. The issue is: can you organize the structure of 
reality so that you find the treasure, the positive aspect of nature 
smiles upon you, you are ruled by the wise king, and you play the 
role of hero? The hope is that you can conduct yourself in such a 
manner that it tilts things in that direction. That it is all we have— 
and it is much better than nothing. If you confront the suffering and 
malevolence, and if you do that truthfully and courageously, you are 
stronger, your family is stronger, and the world is a better place. The 
alternative is resentment, and that makes everything worse. 


DECEIT AND ARROGANCE 


There appear to be two broad forms of deceit: sins of commission, 
the things you do knowing full well they are wrong; and sins of 
omission, which are things you merely let slide—you know you 
should look at, do, or say something, but you do not. Maybe your 
business partner is a little bit crooked with the books, and you 
decide that you are just not going to audit them; or you turn a blind 
eye to your own misbehavior; or you fail to investigate the misdeeds 
of a child, adolescent, or your partner in your household. Instead, 
you just let it go. 

What motivates these kinds of deceit? We lie, outright—the sin of 
commission—knowing full well that we are doing so, to make things 
easier for us, in theory, regardless of the effect upon other people. 
We try to tip the world in our own personal favor. We try to gain an 
edge. We endeavor to avoid a just punishment that is coming our 
way—often by passing it to others. We commit the sin of omission, 


alternatively (and perhaps more subtly), in the belief that what we 
are avoiding will just go away, which it seldom does. We sacrifice 
the future to the present, frequently suffering the slings and arrows 
of outraged conscience for doing so, but continuing, rigidly and 
stubbornly, in any case. 

So, what do people use to justify bending and twisting the 
structure of reality, at the cost of others or even their future selves, 
to benefit themselves now? It is a motivation clearly embedded in 
resentment. Lies are justified by the belief lurking at the bottom of 
the resentful soul that the terrors of the world have been aimed 
specifically at the sufferer attempting to justify his lying. But we 
need to bring arrogance into the conversation, along with 
resentment, to truly understand why we practice to deceive. It is not 
obvious that these states of mind can exist in the absence of each 
other, anyway. They are coconspirators, so to speak. 


COMMISSIONS 

The first conspiracy between deceit and arrogance might be 
regarded as a denial or rejection of the relationship between 
divinity, truth, and goodness. In the early chapters of Genesis, God 
creates habitable chaos out of order with the Word, with the Logos: 
courage, love, and truth. Courage, we might say, is the willingness of 
God to confront the nothingness that preceded Being, which is 
perhaps of the same form we manage when we rise up from poverty 
and nothingness to thrive, or rebuild our lives when they have been 
reduced to chaos by disaster and catastrophe. Love is the ultimate 
aim—the desire to create the very best that can be created. It 
provides the same kind of superstructure for Being, perhaps, as the 
desire for a peaceful and harmonious home provides when such 
desire allows the truth to be spoken. The Word God uses to confront 
the nothingness we spoke of is the Truth, and that truth creates. But 
it does not just create: it appears to create the Good—the very best 
that love would demand. It is not for nothing that God is so 
insistent that what has been created is Good. Arrogance and deceit 


unite to oppose the idea that courageous truth aimed at love creates 
the Good, and replace it with the idea that any whim, large or small, 
has the right and opportunity to reveal itself for purposes that are 
instead narrow and self-serving. 

The second form of arrogance that enables deceit has something 
to do with the assumption of the power of divinity itself. Someone 
who lies, through action, inaction, words, or silence, has made a 
choice about what element of becoming (what element of still- 
unformed but potential chaos) is or is not going to manifest itself. 
This means that the deceitful individual has taken it upon him or 
herself to alter the very structure of reality. And for what? For a 
wish based on the idea that whatever egotistical falsehood conjured 
up by the act of deceit will be better than the reality that would have 
transpired had the truth been enacted or spoken. The liar acts out 
the belief that the false world he brings into being, however 
temporarily, will serve at least his own interests better than the 
alternative. That is the arrogance of someone who believes that he 
can alter the structure of reality through pretense, and that he can 
get away with it. It is not clear how either of these beliefs could be 
sustained, if they are thought through carefully (which implies, of 
course, that they are generally not). First, the transgressor himself 
is going to know that he is not to be trusted in word or action, and 
then, to the degree that genuine self-regard relies on such truth, the 
deceitful words and acts are inevitably going to undermine the 
personality of the liar. At minimum, he will not be living in the real 
world, or in the same world as other people, and so he will be 
weaker than he would have been had he learned what was true 
instead of having substituted for it what is false. Second, for the liar 
to genuinely believe that he is “going to get away with it,” carries 
with it the belief that he is smarter than everyone else—that is, the 
everyone who will not notice (and perhaps that belief comes to 
encompass God, the Creator, whether explicitly or implicitly). 
Perhaps he will get away with one, two, or ten lies, of increasing 
severity, as he is emboldened by success. Each time he succeeds, 
however, his arrogance will increase, as success is rewarding and 
will inspire efforts to duplicate and even increase that reward. This 


cannot help but motivate larger and riskier lies, each associated 
with a longer fall from the heights of pride. The strategy seems 
unworkable—a positive feedback loop designed to drag those who 
entrap themselves within it lower and lower, faster and faster. 

The third form of arrogance that underlies deceit has to do with 
the belief that the deceitful act (which, as we already discussed, has 
bent or warped the structure of reality) will stand on its own 
powerfully, without being revealed and destroyed as reality itself 
straightens and reforms, as it inevitably will. That is the arrogance 
behind the liar’s belief that the lie has somehow permanently 
altered the form of the world, so that now life in the world can be 
conducted as if that lie is somehow real. But reality is very 
complicated and almost everything, it seems, touches on everything 
else. It is very difficult, for example, to make the consequences of an 
adulterous affair stop spreading. People are seen. Tongues start to 
wag. More lies are generated and must be validated to account for 
the time spent on the affair. Scents linger. Affection within the 
relationship starts to be replaced by hatred or contempt 
(particularly if the betrayed person is a genuinely good person, 
providing no excuse for the sinful actions taken against him or her). 

The fourth form of arrogance that justifies deceit has to do with a 
warped sense of justice, often brought about by resentment. People 
employ deception in this fourth set of circumstances because they 
are resentful and angry about their victimized positions in the hell 
and tragedy of the world. This response is entirely understandable, 
although no less dangerous because of that. The logic is simple and 
even compelling, particularly in the case of people who have been 
truly hurt: “I can do what I want because I have been unfairly 
treated.” This reasoning can be seen as simple justice, although it is 
seldom the case that the people who are now being lied to or 
deceived are the same individuals who produced the unfair 
treatment used to justify the falsehood. The arrogance is in 
believing that the unfair treatment was specifically personal, 
existentially speaking, rather than being an expected part of 
existence itself, given its unknown natural, social, and individual 
dangers. If you have been the victim of what appears to be some 


malevolent cosmic joke, then why should not you do whatever is in 
your power to set things a little bit right for yourself? All that line of 
reasoning does, however, is make life worse. If your justification for 
misbehaving was that life was bad, then the rationale for continuing 
to misbehave cannot reasonably be that you should embark on a 
pattern of action that does nothing but make it more so. 


OMISSIONS 

There are a variety of reasons why you stand idly by when 
something you know to be terrible and wrong is occurring, and do 
nothing (including what you know you should have done) to 
interfere. The first of these is nihilism. It might not be immediately 
obvious what nihilism and pride have to do with each other (and 
even less what both have to do with sins of omission). But the 
nihilistic attitude is one of certainty: everything is meaningless, or 
even negative. It is a judgment, a conclusion—and it is a sin of pride, 
in my estimation. I think we are properly bounded in humility by a 
reasonable sense of our own ignorance not to take the terrible risk 
of damning the structure of existence itself. 

Another motive for a sin of omission? The claim that it is 
justifiable to take the easy path. This means living life so that true 
responsibility for anything important never falls on your shoulders. 
And you might think that is perfectly acceptable: “Why should I 
expend extra effort and risk when someone else is lining up for it; 
pushing actively for it; or just not sophisticated enough to slip away 
from it when it seeks them out?” But everyone should take their 
turn—both at receiving the benefits of social interaction and of 
bearing the responsibility for ensuring that such interaction 
remains possible. Children who do not learn that at three do not 
make any friends, and there are good reasons for that. They do not 
know how to play a game that can sustain itself across time, which 
is exactly what a friendship is (as well as the attitude that makes for 
good superiors, peers, and subordinates in a business organization). 


Critically consider, as well, the assumption that it is somehow 
acceptable or even wise to slip by without paying your bills in full. 
This is another variant of the judgment of existence. “It does not 
matter if I take the easy path” begins with “It does not matter,” and 
that is Being, judged and damned, with a twist. The second part of 
the statement, “if I take the easy path,” is a self-imposed curse. If 
you take your turn at the difficult tasks, people learn to trust you, 
you learn to trust yourself, and you get better at doing difficult 
things. All of that is good. If you leave all that undone, you will find 
yourself in the same position as the child whose parents insisted 
upon doing everything for him or her: bereft of the capacity to 
thrive in the face of the difficulties/challenges of life. “It does not 
matter if I take the easy path,” is true only if there is no personality 
element of the speaker that could be called out by a true adventure. 
And those who avoid their destiny by standing back when asked to 
step forward also deprive everyone else of the advantages that may 
have come their way had the person who took the easy way instead 
determined to be all they could be. 

The final form of sins of omission is associated with lack of faith 
in yourself—perhaps in humanity in general—because of the 
fundamental nature of human vulnerability. There is a scene in the 
book of Genesis in which the scales fall from the eyes of Adam and 
Eve, and they realize they are vulnerable and naked—both part and 
parcel of self-consciousness. At the same time, they develop the 
knowledge of good and evil. These two developments coincide 
because it is not possible to hurt other people with true 
effectiveness until you know how you can be hurt yourself. And you 
do not know that you can be hurt until you are, more or less, fully 
self-conscious; until you know that you can suffer excruciating pain; 
until you know that you can be killed; until you realize the limits of 
your being. And as soon as you know all that, you have knowledge 
of your own nakedness, and you can apply knowledge of that 
vulnerability with malevolent intent to other people. And then you 
understand and are capable of Good and Evil. 

When called upon later to account for his behavior—for eating of 
the forbidden fruit—Adam blames the woman for the development 


of his painful self-knowledge, and God for making her, saying as he 
does, “The woman whom thou gavest to be with me, she gave me of 
the tree, and I did eat” (Genesis 3:12). The first man’s refusal to take 
responsibility for his actions is associated with resentment (for his 
acquisition of painful knowledge), deceit (as he knows he made a 
free choice, regardless of his wife’s behavior), and arrogance (he 
dares to blame God and the woman the divinity created). Adam 
takes the easy way out—just as you might, when you say to yourself, 
“I do not need to have this fight with my wife. I do not have to stand 
up to my tyrannical boss. I do not have to live by what I believe to 
be true. I can get away with avoiding my responsibilities.” Some of 
that is inertia and cowardice, but some of it is also motivated by a 
deep sense of disbelief in your own personal ability. Like Adam, you 
know you are naked. You are intimately aware of your flaws and 
vulnerabilities, and the faith in yourself dissolves. This is 
understandable, but neither helpful nor, in the final analysis, 
excusable. 


THE EXISTENTIAL DANGER OF ARROGANCE AND 
DECEIT 


As Proverbs 9:10 has it: “The fear of the Lord is the beginning of 
wisdom.” The connection between deception and the deepest of 
orienting instincts can be profitably comprehended in light of that. 
If you understand that deception corrupts and distorts the function 
of the most fundamental instinct that guides you through the 
difficulties of life, that prospect should scare you enough so that 
you remain careful in what you say and do. A truthful person can 
rely on his or her innate sense of meaning and truth as a reliable 
guide to the choices that must be made through life’s days, weeks, 
and years. But there is a rule that applies—the same rule that 
computer programmers well know: “garbage in, garbage out.” If you 
deceive (particularly yourself), if you lie, then you begin to warp the 
mechanisms guiding the instinct that orients you. That instinct is an 


unconscious guide, so it works underneath your cognitive 
apparatus, especially once it has become habitual. If you rewire the 
unconscious mechanisms that maintain you with assumptions 
derived from something you know to be unreal, then your 
meaningful instinct will take you places you should not go, in 
proportion to its corruption. There is little more terrifying than the 
possibility that you could come to a crisis point in your life when 
you need every faculty you possess, at that moment, to make the 
decision properly, only to find you have pathologized yourself with 
deceit and can no longer rely on your own judgment. Good luck to 
you, because nothing but luck will then serve to save you. 

There is asin somewhat mysteriously defined by Christ as 
unforgivable: “Whosoever speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall 
not be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to 
come” (Matthew 12:32). St. Paul, one of Christianity’s founders, 
shed some light on this statement, when he associated that Third 
Person of the Trinity with conscience: “I say the truth in Christ, I lie 
not, my conscience also bearing me witness in the Holy Ghost” 
(Romans 9:1). Conscience is no less than the sharing of moral 
knowledge with the self. Deceit necessitates voluntary refusal to 
abide by the dictate of conscience, and risks pathologizing that very 
vital function. There is no walking away from that corruption 
unscathed. This is true even in a neurological sense. Drugs of 
addiction are generally characterized by their effects upon the 
neurotransmitter dopamine, increasing its effects in some manner. 
Dopamine essentially produces the pleasure associated with hope or 
possibility. Furthermore, your brain is wired so that if you do 
something that feels good (and therefore produces a dopamine kick) 
then the parts of you that played a role in the action under question 
become stronger, more dominant, more able to inhibit the function 
of other parts of your being. Continued use of an addictive drug 
therefore feeds the growth of what can be accurately conceptualized 
as a living monster in the user’s psyche—and the attention and 
intention of that monster is single-mindedly devoted to the drug’s 
effect. It wants one thing, and it comes armed with an entire 


philosophy about why that one thing must be considered of primary 
import. 

Imagine you are recovering, fragilely, from addiction. Something 
goes wrong in your life. Resentment emerges. You think, “Oh, to 
hell with it!” as the initial event leading to reuse of the drug, and the 
experience of the subsequent dopamine hit. In consequence, the 
little circuits that formulate the thought “to hell with it” grow more 
powerful than the parts of the addict’s psyche that might be 
motivating refusal to use the drug. “To hell with it” is a multifaceted 
philosophy. It means “This is worth sacrificing anything for.” It 
means “Who cares about my life. It is not worth anything, anyway.” 
It means “I do not care if I have to lie to those who love me—my 
parents, my wife and children—because what difference does it 
make, anyway? What I want is the drug.” There is no easy coming 
back from that. 

When you habitually engage in deceit, you build a structure much 
like the one that perpetuates addiction, especially if you get away 
with it, however briefly. The success of the lie is rewarding—and if 
the risks were high, and you are not caught out, that successful 
reward might well be intense. This reinforces the development of 
the neural mechanism in your brain comprising the structure of the 
entire system of deception. With continued success, at least in the 
short term, this mechanism begins to work with increasing 
automaticity—and comes to act, in its arrogant manner, knowing 
that it can get away with it. That is more obvious for sins of 
commission; but it is equally and more dangerously and subtly true 
for what you could know but refuse to—sins of omission. That is the 
arrogance of believing that what you know is sufficient (regardless 
of the evidence that accumulates around you, in the form of 
suffering, which is all too easily and archetypally, let us say, blamed 
on the structure of reality and the apparent insufficiency of God). 


THE PLACE YOU SHOULD BE 


It is in our individual capacity to confront the potential of the future 
and to transform it into the actuality of the present. The way we 
determine what it is that the world transforms into is a consequence 
of our ethical, conscious choices. We wake up in the morning and 
confront the day, with all its possibilities and terrors. We chart a 
course, making decisions for better or worse. We understand full 
well that we can do evil and bring terrible things into Being. But we 
also know that we can do good, if not great, things. We have the best 
chance of doing the latter if we act properly, as a consequence of 
being truthful, responsible, grateful, and humble. 

The right attitude to the horror of existence—the alternative to 
resentment, deceit, and arrogance—is the assumption that there is 
enough of you, society, and the world to justify existence. That is 
faith in yourself, your fellow man, and the structure of existence 
itself: the belief that there is enough to you to contend with 
existence and transform your life into the best it could be. Perhaps 
you could live in a manner whose nobility, grandeur, and intrinsic 
meaning would be of sufficient import that you could tolerate the 
negative elements of existence without becoming so bitter as to 
transform everything around you into something resembling hell. 

Of course, we are oppressed by the fundamental uncertainty of 
Being. Of course, nature does us in, in unjust and painful ways. Of 
course, our societies tend toward tyranny, and our individual 
psyches toward evil. But that does not mean we cannot be good, that 
our societies cannot be just, and that the natural world cannot array 
itself in our favor. What if we could constrain our malevolence a bit 
more, serve and transform our institutions more responsibly, and 
be less resentful? God only knows what the ultimate limit to that 
might be. How much better could things become if we all avoided 
the temptation to actively or passively warp the structure of 
existence; if we replaced anger with the vicissitudes of Being with 
gratitude and truth? And if we all did that, with diligent and 
continual purpose, would we not have the best chance of keeping at 
bay those elements of self, state, and nature that manifest 
themselves so destructively and cruelly, and that motivate our 
turning against the world? 


Do not allow yourself to become resentful, deceitful, or arrogant. 


RULE XIl 


BE GRATEFUL IN SPITE OF YOUR SUFFERING 


DOWN CAN DEFINE UP 


I have been searching for decades for certainty. It has not been 
solely a matter of thinking, in the creative sense, but of thinking and 
then attempting to undermine and destroy those thoughts, followed 
by careful consideration and conservation of those that survive. It is 
identification of a path forward through a swampy passage, 
searching for stones to stand on safely below the murky surface. 
However, even though I regard the inevitability of suffering and its 
exaggeration by malevolence as unshakable existential truths, I 
believe even more deeply that people have the ability to transcend 
their suffering, psychologically and practically, and to constrain 
their own malevolence, as well as the evils that characterize the 
social and the natural worlds. 

Human beings have the capacity to courageously confront their 
suffering—to transcend it psychologically, as well as to ameliorate it 
practically. This is the most fundamental twin axiom of 
psychotherapy, regardless of school of thought, as well as key to the 
mystery of human success and progress across history itself. If you 
confront the limitations of life courageously, that provides you with 
a certain psychological purpose that serves as an antidote to the 
suffering. The fact of your voluntary focus on the abyss, so to speak, 
indicates to yourself at the deepest of levels that you are capable of 
taking on without avoidance the difficulties of existence and the 
responsibility attendant upon that. That mere act of courage is 


deeply reassuring at the most fundamental levels of psychological 
being. It indicates your capability and competence to those deep, 
ancient, and somewhat independent biological and psychological 
alarm systems that register the danger of the world. 

But the utility of such confrontation is by no means merely 
psychological, as important as that is. It is the appropriate pragmatic 
approach as well: If you act nobly—a word that is very rarely used 
now, unfortunately—in the face of suffering, you can work 
practically and effectively to ameliorate and rectify your own and 
other people’s misery, as such. You can make the material world— 
the real world—better (or at least stop it from getting worse). The 
same goes for malevolence: you can constrain that within yourself. 
When you are about to say something, your conscience might (often 
does) inform you, noting, “That is not true.” It might present itself 
as an actual voice (internal, of course) or a feeling of shame, guilt, 
weakness, or other inner disunity—the physiological consequence of 
the duality of psyche you are manifesting. You then have the 
opportunity to cease uttering those words. If you cannot tell the 
truth, you can at least not consciously lie.* That is part of the 
constraint of malevolence. That is something within our grasp. 
Beginning to cease knowingly lying is a major step in the right 
direction. 

We can constrain our suffering, and we can face it 
psychologically. That makes us courageous. Then we can ameliorate 
it practically, because that is what we do when we care for ourselves 
and other people. There seems to be almost no limit to that. You can 
genuinely and competently come to care for yourself and your 
family. You can then extend that out into the broader community. 
Some people become unbelievably good at that. People who work in 
palliative care constitute a prime example. They work continually, 
caring for people who are suffering and dying, and they lose some of 
those people every day. But they manage to get out of bed every 
morning, go to work, and face all that pain, tragedy, and death. They 
make a difference under virtually impossible circumstances. It is for 
such reasons and because of such examples—watching people 
confront the existential catastrophe of life forthrightly and 


effectively—that I am more optimistic than pessimistic, and that I 
believe that optimism is, fundamentally, more reliable than 
pessimism. To come to such a conclusion, and then to find it 
unshakable, is a good example of how and why it may be necessary 
to encounter the darkness before you can see the light. It is easy to 
be optimistic and naive. It is easy for optimism to be undermined 
and demolished, however, if it is naive, and for cynicism to arise in 
its place. But the act of peering into the darkness as deeply as 
possible reveals a light that appears unquenchable, and that is a 
profound surprise, as well as a great relief. 

The same holds true for the issue of gratitude. I do not believe 
you can be appropriately grateful or thankful for what good you 
have and for what evil has not befallen you until you have some 
profound and even terrifying sense of the weight of existence. You 
cannot properly appreciate what you have unless you have some 
sense not only of how terrible things could be, but of how terrible it 
is likely for things to be, given how easy it is for things to be so. This 
is something that is very much worth knowing. Otherwise you 
might find yourself tempted to ask, “Why would I ever look into the 
darkness?” But we seem positively drawn to look. We are fascinated 
by evil. We watch dramatic representations of serial killers, 
psychopaths, and the kings of organized crime, gang members, 
rapists, contract killers, and spies. We voluntarily frighten and 
disgust ourselves with thrillers and horror films—and it is more 
than prurient curiosity. It is the development of some 
understanding of the essentially moral structure of human 
existence, of our suspension between the poles of good and evil. The 
development of that understanding is necessary; it places a down 
below us and an up above us, and orients us in perception, 
motivation, and action. It protects us, as well. If you fail to 
understand evil, then you have laid yourself bare to it. You are 
susceptible to its effects, or to its will. If you ever encounter 
someone who is malevolent, they have control over you in precise 
proportion to the extent that you are unwilling or unable to 
understand them. Thus, you look in dark places to protect yourself, 


in case the darkness ever appears, as well as to find the light. There 
is real utility in that. 


THE MEPHISTOPHELIAN SPIRIT 


The great German writer Goethe, who is to Germanic culture what 
Shakespeare is to English, wrote a famous play, Faust, the story of a 
man who sells his soul to the devil for knowledge.2 Mephistopheles 
is the devil in Goethe’s play—the adversary. The adversary is a 
mythical figure; the spirit who eternally works against our positive 
intent (or, perhaps, against positive intent generally). You can 
understand that psychologically, as well as metaphysically or 
religiously. We all see within ourselves the emergence of good 
intentions and the repeated instructions to ourselves to act 
accordingly, yet we note distressingly often that we leave undone 
what we know we should do, and do instead what we know we 
should not. There is something in all of us that works in 
counterposition to our voluntarily expressed desires. There are in 
fact many such somethings—a chorus of demons, so to speak— 
working at cross-purposes even to each other; many dark and 
unarticulated motivations and systems of belief, all manifesting 
themselves as partial personalities (but with all the essential 
features of personality, despite their partial nature). 

To realize this is uncanny. That realization is the great 
contribution of the psychoanalysts, who insisted above all, perhaps, 
that we were inhabited by spirits that were beyond not only our 
control but even our conscious knowledge. And that realization 
brings up great and paralyzing questions: If you are not in control of 
yourself, who or what is? If you are not, a challenge has been posed 
to the very idea of the centrality, unity, and even reality of the “you” 
whose existence seems so immediately certain. And what is that 
who or what that is not you up to? And toward what end is it 
acting? We all hope we are the sorts of creatures who can tell 
ourselves what to do, and who will then do exactly that, in 
accordance with our will. You are you, after all, and you should— 


virtually by definition—be in control of yourself. But things often do 
not work that way, and the reason or reasons they do not are deeply 
mysterious. 

Sometimes, of course, it is simply much easier just not to do the 
things we should. Good actions can be and often are difficult to 
undertake, and there is danger—exhaustion not the least of it—in 
difficulty. Inertia is also a powerful reason for stasis and can provide 
a certain immediate safety. But there is more to the problem. It is 
not just that you are lazy: it is also that you are bad—and declared so 
by your own judgment. That is a very unpleasant realization, but 
there is no hope of becoming good without it. You will upbraid 
yourself (or your conscience will do so) for your shortcomings. You 
will treat yourself as if you were or are at least in part an immoral 
agent. That is all deeply unpleasant too, and you might well be 
motivated to avoid your own judgment. But no simple 
rationalizations will allow for your escape. 

You will see, if you are willing to look, the adversarial force at 
work within you, working to undermine your best intentions. The 
exact nature of that force is grounds for endless speculation— 
philosophical, literary, psychological, and above all, religious or 
theological. The Christian conception of the great figure of evil— 
Mephistopheles, Satan, Lucifer, the devil himself—is, for example, a 
profound imaginative personification of that spirit. But the 
adversary is not merely something that exists in the imagination— 
certainly not only in the individual imagination. It is also something 
that manifests itself through something that is still aptly described 
as “possession” in the motivation for malevolent actions, as well as 
in the acts themselves. Everyone who has thought or said 
something akin to “I do not understand what came over me” after 
acting in a particularly unseemly manner notes the existence of 
such possession, even if they cannot or do not articulate that noting. 
In consequence, we may ask ourselves, in utter dismay, “Why would 
such a spirit exist? Why would it be part of each of us?” 

The answer appears to be partly associated with the powerful 
sense that each of us shares of our own intrinsic mortal limitations, 
our subjugation to the suffering inflicted upon us by ourselves, 


society, and nature. That embitters and produces a certain self- 
contempt or disgust, inspired by our own weaknesses and 
inadequacies (and I am not speaking here yet of immorality, merely 
of our intrinsic and terrible fragility), and also by the apparent 
unfairness, unpredictability, and arbitrariness of our failings. Given 
all these disappointing realizations, there is no reason to assume 
that you are going to be satisfied or happy with yourself, or with 
Being itself. Such dissatisfaction—such unhappiness—can easily 
come to reinforce and magnify itself in a vicious circle. With each 
step you take against yourself or others as a consequence of your 
unhappiness and resentment, there is more to be ashamed of, and 
more reason for self-directed antagonism. It is not for nothing that 
approximately one person in five engages in some form of serious 
physical self-harm in their lifetime.* And this does not include the 
most serious act—suicide itself (or the more common tendency 
toward suicidal ideation). If you are unhappy with yourself, why 
would you work in your best interest? Maybe something vengeful 
would emerge from you, instead; maybe something capable of 
justifying itself while it metes out hypothetically deserved suffering, 
designed to interfere with your movement forward. If you 
conceptually aggregate and unite into a single personality all that 
opposes you in you, all that opposes your friendships, and all that 
opposes your wife or husband, the adversary emerges. That is 
precisely Mephistopheles in Goethe’s play—the devil himself. That 
is the spirit who works against—and that is exactly how he 
describes himself: “I am the spirit that denies.”* Why? Because 
everything in the world is so limited and imperfect—and causes 
itself so much trouble and terror because of that—that its 
annihilation is not only justified but ethically demanded. So goes, at 
least, the rationalization. 

This is no mere lifeless abstraction. People struggle in a deadly 
fashion with such ideas. Women wrestle with them when they 
consider having a baby, inquiring of themselves: “Should I really 
bring an infant into a world like this? Is that an ethical decision?” 
The followers of the philosophical school of antinatalism, of whom 
the South African philosopher David Benatar is perhaps the leading 


advocate,° would decisively answer no to both of those questions. I 
debated his views with him a few years back.® It was not as if I failed 
to understand his position. There is no doubt that the world is 
steeped in suffering. A few years later, I debated another 
philosopher, Slavoj Zizek—known much more widely for his Marxist 
predilections than his religious convictions. He said something 
during our discussion that might be theologically debatable, but that 
I found of great interest. In the Christian tradition, even God 
Himself, in the form of Christ, despairs of the meaning of life and 
the goodness of His Father in the agony of His Crucifixion. At the 
peak of his suffering, just before death, He utters the words “Eli Eli 
lama sabachthani’”*—“My God, my God, why has thou forsaken 
me?” (Matthew 27:46). This appears to strongly imply, in its 
narrative way, that the burden of life can become so great that even 
God Himself can lose faith when confronted with the unbearable 
reality of injustice, betrayal, suffering, and death. 

It is hard to imagine a story more sympathetic to mere mortals. If 
God Himself experiences doubts in the midst of His self-imposed 
agony, how could we mere humans not fall prey to the same failing? 
And it is possible that it was compassion that was driving the 
antinatalist Benatar’s position. I saw no evidence that Benatar was 
malevolent in any obvious manner. He appeared to truly believe—in 
a manner I found reminiscent of Goethe’s Mephistopheles—that the 
combination of consciousness, vulnerability, and mortality is so dire 
that there is simply no moral excuse for its continuance. Now, it is 
entirely possible that Mephistopheles’s opinion is not to be trusted. 
Since he is Satan himself, there is no reason to assume that the 
argument he puts forward to justify his adversarial stance toward 
Being is valid, or even that he himself truly believes it. And perhaps 
the same was true of Benatar, who was and is no doubt prey to the 
frailties that characterize each of us (and that certainly includes me, 
despite the stance I took in opposition to him). But I believed then 
and still firmly believe now that the consequences of his self- 
negating position are simply too dire. It leads directly to an antilife 
or even an anti-Being nihilism so profound that its manifestation 
could not help but exaggerate and amplify the destructive 


consequences of existence that are already the focus of the 
hypothetically compassionate antinatalists themselves (and I am 
not being sarcastic or cynical about the existence of that 
compassion, misplaced though I believe it to be). 

Benatar’s hypothesis was that life is so rife with suffering that it 
is, actually, a sin—for all intents and purposes—to bring any new 
conscious beings into existence, and that the most appropriate 
ethical action for human beings to take would be to simply stop 
doing so: to render ourselves voluntarily extinct. Such a viewpoint is 
more widespread, in my opinion, than you might think, although 
perhaps rarely held for long. Whenever you are cut off at the knees 
by one of life’s many catastrophes, whenever a dream collapses, or 
someone close to you is hurt in some fundamental way—especially 
a child or another loved one—then you can easily find yourself 
thinking, “Perhaps it would be better if the whole mess was just 
brought to a halt.” 

That is certainly what people think when they contemplate 
suicide. Such thoughts are generated in their most extreme variant 
by the serial killers, by high school shooters, by all generally 
homicidal and genocidal actors. They are acting out the adversarial 
attitude as fully as they might. They are truly possessed, in a 
manner that exceeds the merely metaphorical. They have decided 
not only that life is unbearable and the malevolence of existence is 
inexcusable, but that everything should be punished for the mere 
sin of its Being. If we want to have any hope of dealing with the 
existence of evil, and working toward its minimization, we must 
understand these sorts of impulses. It is in no small part the 
consciousness of suffering and malevolence that embitters people. 
And it is toward this embitterment that I believe the antinatalist 
position would, if widely adopted, inevitably drift. First, it might be 
the mere refusal to reproduce. But I cannot believe that it would be 
long until that impulse to cease production of new life was 
transformed into a similar impulse to destroy life that currently 
exists, In consequence of the “compassionate” judgment that some 
lives are so terrible that it is merciful to bring them to an end. That 
philosophy emerged relatively early in the Nazi era, for example, 


when individuals judged unbearably damaged by life were 
euthanized for purposes deemed “morally merciful.” The question 
this line of thinking leads to is where does such “mercy” stop? How 
sick, old, intellectually impaired, crippled, unhappy, unproductive, 
or politically inappropriate do you have to be before dispensing with 
you is amoral imperative? And why would you believe, once the 
eradication or even merely the limitation of life became your 
guiding star, that you would not continue down that road to its 
hellish end? 

I found the Columbine High School killers’ writings particularly 
instructive in that regard. They are scrawled out, and are careless, 
incoherent, and narcissistic, but there is definitely a philosophy at 
the base of them: that things deserve to suffer for the crime of their 
existence. The consequence of that belief is the creative elaboration 
and extension of that suffering. One of the killers wrote that he 
considered himself the judge of all that exists—a judge that found 
Being, particularly of the human form, wanting—and that it would 
be better if the entire human race was eradicated. That defined the 
scope of his horrific vision. He and his partner shot their classmates 
in their local high school, but that was only a tiny fraction of what 
they were planning. They had incendiary devices laid out across the 
community, and had fantasized together about trying to take out the 
entire city. Such plans are just a step on the way to the ultimate 
genocidal vision. 

You do not have those sorts of visions unless you are deeply 
possessed by something very much resembling the adversarial 
spirit. That is Mephistopheles, whose essential viewpoint might be 
paraphrased as follows: “Life is so terrible, because of its limitations 
and malevolence, that it would be better if it did not exist at all.” 
That is the central doctrine of the spirit that works at 
counterpurposes to you. It is an arguable case and not surprising 
that it should emerge, and it seems terribly credible at moments of 
crisis, even though I believe it is deeply wrong. I think the reason 
that it is wrong, in part, is because, when it is realized, all it does is 
exacerbate an already admittedly bad situation. If you set about 
making things worse, they are likely, in fact, to get worse. I cannot 


see how this constitutes an improvement, if your original objection 
was motivated by the essential terror of our existential situation 
itself. It does not seem to be a pathway that a conscious creature, 
with a bit of gratitude, might walk down. There is an incoherency to 
it that is logically untenable, and that therefore seems to make the 
argument fundamentally specious, and cannot help but make the 
listener think, “There are things going on here behind the scenes 
that are both unspoken and unspeakable, despite the surface logic.” 
The failings in the adversary’s logic do not mean that 
constructing an unshakable viewpoint to counter it is a simple 
matter. In the most straightforward sense, identifying that vision of 
objection and vengefulness is useful, in the way that negative space 
in a painting is useful: it defines the positive, by contrast. Good can 
be conceptualized—however vaguely in its initial formulation—as 
the opposite of whatever constitutes evil, which is usually more 
readily identifiable in the world than goodness. I have been trying to 
find touchstones on that pathway of opposition to evil, so that 
people can identify what that good might be. Some of these are very 
practical, if difficult. I have been suggesting to my viewers and 
listeners,® for example—particularly those currently burdened by 
the mortal illness of a parent—that it is useful to consciously take 
on the task of being the most reliable person in the aftermath of the 
death, during the grief-stricken preparations for the funeral and the 
funeral itself, and for the care of family members during and after 
the catastrophe. There is a call to your potential in doing that. There 
is a call to the strength of Being itself—the Being that could 
manifest itself in you. The human race has been dealing with loss 
and death forever. We are the descendants of those who could 
manage it. That capability is within us, grim as the task might seem. 
If you truly love someone, it can seem a deep form of betrayal to 
stay integrated and healthy, in essence, in their absence or sadly 
waning presence. What does that ability indicate, after all, about the 
true depths of your love? If you can witness their demise and 
survive the loss, does that not imply that the bond was shallow and 
temporary, and even replaceable? If you were truly bonded, should 
not it destroy you (as it sometimes does)? But we cannot wish that 


every inevitable loss leads to the destruction of everyone affected, 
because we would then all be doomed, far more immediately than 
we currently are. And it certainly is not the case that the last wish of 
the dying is or should be the interminable suffering of those they 
love. My impression has been, instead, that people tend to feel 
guilty on their deathbeds (because of their immediate uselessness 
and the burden that causes, but even more because of their 
apprehension about the grief and trouble they will cause those left 
behind). Thus, their most fervent wish, I believe, is that those 
whom they love will be able to move forward and live happily, after 
a reasonable time of mourning. 

To collapse in the aftermath of a tragic loss is therefore more 
accurately a betrayal of the person who has died, instead of a 
tribute, as it multiplies the effect of that mortal catastrophe. It takes 
a dying person of narcissistic selfishness to wish endless grief on 
their loved ones. Strength in the face of death is better for the 
person who is dying and for those who remain living alike. There 
are family members who are suffering because of their loss who 
need taking care of, and who may be too old and infirm and 
otherwise troubled to cope with the situation properly. And so 
someone strong has to step in and exercise the terrible authority 
that makes even of death something to face and overcome. To 
understand clearly that you are morally obliged under such 
circumstances to manifest strength in the face of adversity is to 
indicate to yourself—and, perhaps, to other people—that there is 
something in you of sufficient grandeur and power to face the worst 
forthrightly and to yet prevail. That is certainly what people need to 
encounter at a funeral. There is little to say, explicitly, in the face of 
death. Everyone is rendered speechless when they encounter the 
infinite expanse of emptiness surrounding our too-brief existence. 
But uprightness and courage in such a situation is truly heartening 
and sustaining. 

I have suggested that strength at the funeral of someone dear and 
close is a worthy goal more than once during a lecture (where 
people might encounter it live, or on YouTube or a podcast). In 
consequence, a not insignificant number of people have indicated to 


me that they took heart in desperate times as a consequence. They 
set reliability and strength in a crisis as a conscious goal and were 
able to manage exactly that, so that the devastated people around 
them had someone to lean on and see as an example in the face of 
genuine trouble. That, at the very least, made a bad situation much 
less dreadful than it might have been. And that is something. If you 
can observe someone rising above the catastrophe, loss, bitterness, 
and despair, then you see evidence that such a response to 
catastrophe is possible. In consequence, you might mimic that, even 
under dire circumstances. Courage and nobility in the face of 
tragedy is the reverse of the destructive, nihilistic cynicism 
apparently justified under just such circumstances. 

Again, I understand the negative attitude. I have had thousands 
hours of clinical experience. I have been deeply involved in some 
very difficult situations, along with those I was listening to and 
strategizing with, as well as within the confines of my private life. 
People have arduous lives. You think your life is hard (and it 
probably is, at least at times), then you meet someone and your life 
is so much better than theirs that, no matter what your hardships 
are, you cannot even conceive of how they might continue to exist 
in their current misery. And you find out, not infrequently, that 
those same unfortunate people know someone else whose life is so 
hard that they feel the same way about them. And even they are 
often left feeling guilty that they believe what they have is a hard 
lot, because they know just how much worse it could be. 

It is not as if the suffering and betrayal, the catastrophes, are of 
insufficient gravity to make bitterness a real option. But there is just 
no good whatsoever in that option, and plenty of evident harm. So, 
what constitutes the alternative? I began to seriously contemplate 
the topic of this rule just before Thanksgiving, in 2018, when I was 
touring the United States. That holiday has become, arguably, the 
biggest shared celebration in America (and is also a major event in 
Canada, approximately a month earlier). The only competitor, 
particularly since Easter has largely faded away, is Christmas, which 
is also in some sense a holiday of thanksgiving, concentrating as it 
does on the arrival of the eternal Redeemer in the midst of the 


darkness and cold of winter, and so reflects the endless birth and 
rebirth of hope itself. The giving of thanks is an alternative to 
bitterness—perhaps the alternative. My observation of American 
holidays—I lived in the States for seven years, and I have spent time 
there on countless other occasions—is that the prominence of 
Thanksgiving among holidays seems to be a good thing, practically 
and symbolically. The fact that the primary feast of celebration 
characterizing a country would be one of explicitly “giving thanks” 
appears, in principle, as a positive commentary on the fundamental 
ethic of the state. It means that the individual is striving to have his 
or her heart in the right place, and that the group is supporting and 
encouraging that endeavor. Why is that, given the trouble that 
constitutes life? It is because you can be courageous. You can be 
alert, awake, attentive. You can see how demanding life is and can 
be, and you can see it clearly. Despite this, you can remain grateful, 
because that is the intrepid attitude toward life and its difficulties. 
You are grateful not because you are naive, but because you have 
decided to put a hand forward to encourage the best in yourself, and 
the state, and the world. You are grateful, in the same manner, not 
because suffering is absent, but because it is valiant to remember 
what you have and what you may still be offered—and because the 
proper thankful attitude toward that existence and possibility 
positions you better than any other attitude toward the vicissitudes 
of existence. 

To be grateful for your family is to remember to treat them 
better. They could cease to exist at any moment. To be grateful for 
your friends is to awaken yourself to the necessity of treating them 
properly, given the comparative unlikelihood of friendship itself. To 
be grateful to your society is to remind yourself that you are the 
beneficiary of tremendous effort on the part of those who 
predeceased us, and left this amazing framework of social structure, 
ritual, culture, art, technology, power, water, and sanitation so that 
our lives could be better than theirs. 

The temptation to become embittered is great and real. It 
requires a genuine moral effort not to take that path, assuming that 
you are not—or are no longer—naive. The gratitude associated with 


that state of Being is predicated on ignorance and inexperience. That 
is not virtue. Thus, if you are attentive and awake, and you can see 
the structure of the world, bitterness and resentment beckon as a 
viable response. Then you might well ask yourself, “Well, why not 
walk down that dark path?” It seems to me that the answer to that, 
to state it again, is courage: the courage to decide “No, that is not for 
me, despite the reasons I may have for being tempted in that 
direction,” and to decide, instead, “Despite the burden of my awake 
mortality, I am going to work for the good of the world.” 


COURAGE—BUT SUPERORDINATE, LOVE 


That decision seems to me to be courage subsumed to love. If it is 
resentment and bitterness and the consequent hatred that emerges 
from that tempting us toward the torment and destruction of 
everything that lives and suffers, then perhaps it is active love that 
aims at its betterment. And that seems to me to be the fundamental 
decision of life, and that it is correct to identify it, at least in a vital 
part, as an act of voluntary will. The reasons for acrimony, anger, 
resentment, and malevolence are strong and plentiful. Thus, it must 
be a leap of faith—a decision about a mode of being not so clearly 
justified by the evidence, particularly in hard times—that Being 
should be strengthened and supported by your aims and your acts. 
That is something done in some deep sense despite “Eli Eli lama 
sabachthani’—something that says “despite it all, no matter what it 
is, onward and upward”—and that is precisely the impossible moral 
undertaking that is demanded from each of us for the world to 
function properly (even for it to avoid degeneration into hell). 

It is within the frame of that impossible undertaking—that 
decision to love—that courage manifests itself, enabling each person 
who adopts the courageous pathway to do the difficult things that 
are necessary to act for the good in even the worst of times. If you 
determine to manifest the two virtues of love and courage— 
simultaneously, consciously—you decide that you are going to work 
to make things better and not worse, even for yourself, even though 


you know that because of all your errors and omissions you are 
already three-quarters lost. 

You are going to work to make things better for yourself, as if you 
are someone you are responsible for helping. You are going to do 
the same thing for your family and the broader community. You are 
going to strive toward the harmony that could manifest itself at all 
those levels, despite the fact that you can see the flawed and 
damaged substructure of things, and have had your vision damaged 
in consequence. That is the proper and courageous pathway 
forward. Maybe that is the definition of gratitude, of thankfulness, 
and I cannot see how that is separate from courage and love. 

You might well ask, “Do people actually perceive and act in this 
manner?”—even—“Can they?” One of the most compelling pieces of 
evidence I have come across is the fact of grief over the loss of 
someone close. Even if you are ambivalent about life itself—and 
maybe even if you are ambivalent, to some degree, about the person 
that you lost, because that can certainly be the case—your likely 
response to a death is grief. That response is not exactly conscious. 
Grief is a strange experience. It seizes you unexpectedly. You feel 
shock and confusion. You are not at all sure how to respond. What 
is it that you are supposed to do? But if it is conscious grieving—the 
voluntary acting out of the supposedly appropriate response—it is 
not real; not in the manner that genuine grief grips you of its own 
accord. And if you do not feel yourself seized, unwittingly, in the 
latter sense, you might think, “I am not feeling the way I am 
supposed to feel. I am not crying. I am not overwhelmed by sorrow. 
I am going far too normally about my day-to-day business” 
(something particularly likely to occur if you receive the news of a 
death from a distant locale). But then, as you engage in something 
trivial, as if things are normal, the grief will strike you like a rogue 
wave. That happens repeatedly, God only knows for how long. It is 
something that arises from the depths, and it takes you irresistibly 
in its grasp. 

Grief must be a reflection of love. It is perhaps the ultimate proof 
of love. Grief is an uncontrollable manifestation of your belief that 
the lost person’s existence, limited and flawed as it might have 


been, was worthwhile, despite the limitations and flaws even of life 
itself. Otherwise, why would you feel the loss? Otherwise, why 
would you feel, involuntarily, sorrowful and bereft (and that from a 
source self-deception cannot reach)? You grieve because something 
that you valued is no longer in existence. Thus, in the core of your 
Being, you have decided that the person’s life was valuable, despite 
whatever trouble they caused you—and themselves. In my 
experience, that happens even when people die who were quite 
monstrous. It is a rare person whose life has gone so 
catastrophically wrong that their death brings no sorrow. 

There is a deep part of us that makes the decision, when we 
grieve for someone we have lost, that their existence was 
worthwhile, despite it all. Maybe that is a reflection of an even more 
fundamental decision: Being itself is worth having, despite it all. 
Gratitude is therefore the process of consciously and courageously 
attempting thankfulness in the face of the catastrophe of life. 
Maybe that is what we are trying to do when we meet with our 
families during a holiday, wedding, or funeral. Those are often 
contentious and difficult affairs. We face a paradoxical, demanding 
tension. We bring people that we know and love close to us; we are 
pleased at their existence and their proximity, but also wish they 
could be more. We are inevitably disappointed in each other, and in 
ourselves, as well. 

In any familial gathering, there is tension between the warmth 
you feel and the bonding of memory and shared experience, and the 
sorrow inevitably accompanying that. You see some relatives who 
are in a counterproductive stasis, or wandering down a path that is 
not good for them. You see others aging, losing their vitality and 
health (and that sight interferes with and disrupts your memories of 
their more powerful and youthful selves: a dual loss, then, of 
present and past). That is all painful to perceive. But the 
fundamental conclusion, despite all of that, is that “It is good that 
we are all together and able to share a meal, and to see and talk to 
each other, and to note that we are all here and facing this 
celebration or difficulty together.” And everyone hopes that 
“perhaps if we pull together, we can manage this properly.” And so 


you make the same fundamental decision, when you join 
communally with your people, that you make when you grieve: 
“Despite everything, it is good that we are together, and that we 
have one another.” That is something truly positive. 

The same is true of your relationship with your children. My grief 
at life in recent decades was exaggerated in the case of my daughter, 
because she was very ill for many years as a child, adolescent, and 
young adult. A child is a being of tremendous potential, capable of 
developing an admirable, productive, and ever-increasing autonomy 
and ability. But there is also something truly fragile about their 
three- or four- or five- (or even fifteen- or twenty-five-) year-old 
forms (because that fragility never truly disappears from a parent’s 
perception, once it has been experienced deeply, as it certainly will 
be with the experience of caring for young children). All that is part 
of the joy of having them, but also part of the pain. The pain is the 
absolute certainty that the fragility will be exploited. And yet I 
thought that whatever steps I might take to eradicate that fragility 
in my children would also destroy that for which I was thankful. I 
remember thinking this quite distinctly with my son when he was 
three, because he was supercute and fun. But he was three, so he 
was little. He would collapse, bang his head on tables, fall down the 
stairs, and get into little scraps with other kids. Maybe he would be 
playing in the supermarket parking lot and, distracted, run off 
briefly. This is not a wise move in a place ruled by cars. There is an 
undeniable vulnerability around children that wakes you up and 
makes you very conscious of the desire to protect them, but also of 
the desire to foster their autonomy and push them out in the world, 
because that is how you strengthen them. It is also a vulnerability 
that can make you angry at life because of its fragility, and lead you 
to curse the fate that joins the two together. 

When I think about my parents, the same thing comes to mind. 
They are getting old. As people get older, in some sense, you see 
them crystallize into the people that they are. My father and my 
mother both have a decided character. They were who they were in 
their fifties, and now they are perhaps even more so. They have 
their limitations and their advantages (and it is even the case that 


the latter are often integrally necessary to the former). They are in 
their eighties now and are very particularized. Sometimes it is 
frustrating to deal with people and their particularities. You think, 
“Would not it be better if they could be some other way?” I am not 
saying I think that about my parents more than people generally 
think that about each other. It is by no means a criticism of them. In 
addition, there is no doubt that they (and others—many others) feel 
the same way about me. But it is necessary to understand that, just 
as in the case of children, all those particularities, fragilities, and 
limitations are part and parcel of what it is that you come to love. 

So, you might love people despite their limitations, but you also 
love them because of their limitations. That is something very much 
worth understanding. Doing so may help you see how gratitude 
remains possible. Despite the fact that the world is a very dark 
place, and that each of us has our black elements of soul, we see in 
each other a unique blend of actuality and possibility that is a kind 
of miracle: one that can manifest itself, truly, in the world, in the 
relationships we have that are grounded in trust and love. That is 
something for which you can be courageously thankful. That is 
something in which you can discover part of the antidote to the 
abyss and the darkness. 

Be grateful in spite of your suffering. 


Coda 


As I indicated in the overture, much of this book was written during 
long months spent in hospitals—first, visiting or staying with my 
daughter, Mikhaila, then doing the same over a longer period with 
my wife, Tammy, and finally—when it became necessary—during 
my repeated admissions. I do not think it appropriate to write about 
those personal trials in any more detail than I already have in the 
Overture—partly because the common circumstances of the COVID- 
19 pandemic have rendered everyone’s life tragic in an 
unimaginable manner, so that it seems superfluous, in some sense, 
to provide a detailed account of familial or individual suffering on 
top of that, and partly because the current book is not about my 
daughter’s troubles, or my wife’s, or mine, directed as it is to topics 
of general psychological import. What I truly find necessary to 
relate, however, is our appreciation to all those many people who 
supported us during this trying time. So, some additional discussion 
of our various maladies appears unavoidable at this point. 

On the public front, we received an outpouring of good wishes 
from thousands of people who had become familiar with my work. 
Some of this was delivered in person, when people met Tammy or 
me in public; some was sent by email and social media; and some of 
it came in YouTube comments on my videos. This was exceptionally 
heartening. My sister, Bonnie, gathered and printed out particularly 
thoughtful messages to Tammy from around the world, and posted 
them in bright colors on the walls of the hospital room where they 
could be easily seen. The messages later addressed to me helped 
bolster my oft-wavering conviction that I could and should prevail 
in the face of the difficulties I was experiencing, and that the book 
you are reading or listening to would maintain its relevance, even in 


the face of the terrible pandemic that currently envelops the world. 
We were also the beneficiaries of medical care, much of it extreme, 
but most often provided with optimism, care, and competence. 
Tammy’s dual cancer surgeries were courageously performed by Dr. 
Nathan Perlis of the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, and when the 
complications arising thereof became too extreme, was treated by 
Dr. Maxim Itkin, director of Philadelphia’s Penn Center for 
Lymphatic Disorders. 

More privately, Tammy and I were individually and jointly the 
grateful beneficiaries of constant support from family and friends, 
who interrupted their lives to spend days, weeks, or months of time 
with us while we were undergoing our trials. I can only hope, in the 
face of serious doubts about the matter, that I would have chosen to 
be as generous with my time and attention as they were if the tables 
were turned. It is particularly necessary to thank my family 
members—my daughter, Mikhaila Peterson, and her husband, 
Andrey Korikov; my son, Julian Peterson, and daughter-in-law, 
Jillian Vardy; my brother-in law and sister Jim and Bonnie Keller; 
my brother and sister-in-law Joel and Kathleen Peterson; my 
parents, Beverley and Walter Peterson; my brother- and sister-in- 
law Dale and Maureen Roberts, and their daughter, Tasha; my 
sister-in-law Della Roberts and her husband, Daniel Grant; as well 
as our friends Wayne Meretsky, Myriam Mongrain, Queenie Yu, 
Morgan and Ava Abbott, Wodek Szemberg and Estera Bekier, Wil 
Cunningham and Shona Tritt, Jim Balsillie and Neve Peric, Dr. 
Norman and Karen Doidge, Gregg and Dr. Delinah Hurwitz (the 
former of whom also profoundly helped me edit and improve 12 
Rules for Life: An Antidote to Chaos), Dr. Cory and Nadine 
Torgerson, Sonia and Marshall Tully, Dr. Robert O. and Sandra Pihl, 
Dr. Daniel Higgins and Dr. Alice Lee, Dr. Mehmet and Lisa Oz, and 
Dr. Stephen and Dr. Nicole Blackwood, all of whom went above and 
beyond the call of duty in the attention they paid to Tammy and me 
over the last two years. There are, finally, three men of God who 
were of service, particularly to Tammy: Fathers Eric Nicolai, Fred 
Dolan, and Walter Hannam. 


My family made arrangements to have me treated in Moscow for 
the consequence of a paradoxical reaction and then a dependence on 
the hypothetically safe but truly dangerous benzodiazepine 
antianxiety medication. This was arranged with exceptional 
efficiency, despite the time of year (the Christmas and New Year 
holidays in 2019-20), by Kirill Sergeevich Mikhailov, the consul 
general of the Russian Federation in Toronto, and the consular staff 
who provided an urgent visa in a matter of days. Many people, 
including Kelly and Joe Craft, Anish Dwivedi, Jamil Javani, Zach 
Lahn, Chris Halverson, Metropolitan Jonah, and the V. Rev. Victor 
Potapov and Dimitir Ivanov, helped expedite what was a very 
complex, multidimensional process. While in Russia, my safety was 
ensured by Alexander Usov, and my sense of isolation diminished 
by daily visits by Mikhaila and her husband, Andrey, who truly 
cannot be thanked enough. The Russian medical teams included 
IMC Addiction by Roman Yuzapolski, who agreed to supervise my 
case despite being advised by assorted experts that it was too 
dangerous to do so, and his staff members, Herman Stepnov, 
administrative directors, and Alexandr, therapist, who translated for 
me constantly for a two-week period, without even a change of 
clothes. The team of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences took 
me in with undiagnosed double pneumonia and in a state of 
catatonia and delirium, and restored my ability to ambulate. Dr. 
Marina Petrova, the deputy director, and Dr. Michael, the head 
doctor of what was known as the Reanimatology Ward, were of 
particular and notable aid. Uliana Efros, nanny to my 
granddaughter, Elizabeth Scarlett, always had our backs and 
traveled with Mikhaila, Andrey, and me for eight months from 
Russia to Florida and Serbia, caring for Scarlett, including spending 
a month in quarantine. Thanks as well to Uli’s daughter Liza 
Romanova, who helped take care of Scarlett in Russia, so that my 
daughter and son-in-law could visit me in the hospital. Finally, on 
the Russian end, I would like to thank Mikhail Avdeev, who helped 
us extensively with provision of medication and translation of 
medical information—both on very short notice. 


Later, in June 2020, I sought admission at the IM Clinic for 
Internal Medicine in Belgrade, an institution dedicated to 
benzodiazepine withdrawal, and fell directly under the competent 
and caring treatment provided by Dr. Igor Bolbukh and his staff. Dr. 
Bolbukh had flown to Russia previously to consult there while I was 
in a state of delirium, provided months of pro bono medical 
guidance, moved me to a more stable condition when I arrived in 
Serbia, and managed my care thereafter. The IM Clinic was founded 
by Dr. Nikolai Vorobiev, and his staff were very patient, without 
resentment—a difficult feat to manage in these days of COVID and 
the inevitable accompanying and sudden quarantines. 

There are also those who profoundly deserve credit, recognition, 
and gratitude on the professional front. Thank you to my agents, 
Mollie Glick of Creative Artists Agency, as well as Sally Harding of 
CookeMcDermid (Canada) and her colleagues Suzanne Brandreth 
and Hana El Niwairi of Cooke Agency International Canada. Thank 
you to the editors and publishers of 12 Rules for Life: An Antidote 
to Chaos: Penguin Random House Canada senior editor Craig 
Pyette, who played a diligent and instrumental role in quality 
control and enhancement; former CEO Brad Martin; current CEO 
Kristin Cochrane; publisher of the Knopf Random House Canada 
Publishing Group Anne Collins; vice president, associate publisher, 
and director of marketing strategy Scott Sellers; Penguin Random 
House UK editor Laura Stickney and her colleague Penelope Vogler, 
and CEO Tom Weldon; and Penguin Random House International 
CEO Markus Dohle. Thanks to the editors and publishers of the 
current book, a group that includes the immediately 
aforementioned individuals, as well as additional Penguin Random 
House US personnel, including publisher of the Portfolio and 
Sentinel imprints Adrian Zackheim and editor Helen Healey. 
Finally, thank you to Professor Bruce Pardy and lawyer Jared Brown 
for their active support of my ideas during a time when doing so 
could be truly hazardous to one’s professional reputation and 
security. 

The worldwide tour of 160 cities that Tammy and I undertook 
during the incubation period of this book as well as its preliminary 


formulation was organized with exceptional efficiency and good 
nature by Creative Artists Agency representatives Justin Edbrooke 
(assisted by Daniel Smith) and Ari Levin (assisted by Colette Silver), 
as well as Live Nation’s Andrew Levitt. The Australian and New 
Zealand tour benefited from the attention of Australian producer 
TEG Dainty’s Brad Drummond, tour manager Simon Christian, and 
security man Scott Nicholson. Gunnlaugur Jonsson and his crew 
were exceptionally hospitable to Tammy and me (as well as to my 
mother and aunt, who accompanied us for the days we were in 
Iceland). John O’Connell served as primary tour manager, and was 
extremely professional, great at problem solving, and consistently 
upbeat and supportive over the months of travel and organization. 

Dave Rubin of The Rubin Report traveled with us, introduced my 
lectures, and emceed the question-and-answer periods that 
followed, adding a necessary bit of levity to what might otherwise 
have been a too-serious endeavor. Rob Greenwald of Rogers & 
Cowan helped ensure appropriate media coverage. Joe Rogan, Ben 
Shapiro, Douglas Murray, Gad Saad, and Steven Crowder extended 
their friendship and shared their extensive media presence. Zachary 
Lahn was there many times as needed, and Jeff Sandefer opened up 
his extensive connection network. Bill Vardy, Dennis Thigpen, 
Duncan Maisels, and Melanie Paquette served as drivers for the 
tour leg in North America when we used motor homes. Tammy and 
I would also like to thank designer Shelley Kirsch and the crew at 
SJOC Construction for completing the renovation of our house 
during these trying times with minimal supervision on our part. So 
much has happened in the last three years I am sure that I have 
missed key people, and for that I sincerely apologize. 

Thanks is due, finally, to all of you who have read or listened to 
my books—Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief, as well as 
the two 12 Rules volumes—and/or tuned in to my YouTube videos 
and podcasts. I have been profoundly struck, as have the people 
close to me, by the exceptional loyalty and care you have 
demonstrated over the last half decade. May all of you reading or 
listening to this book wend your way successfully through these 
difficult times. I hope you are surrounded by people you love and 


who love you in turn. I hope that you can rise to the challenge 
presented by our current circumstances, and that we all might have 
the good fortune to eventually turn our attention to rebuilding the 
world after the deluge.

*It is possible, in fact, to remove the entire brain of a female cat—to take a common 
example from the scientific literature—excepting the hypothalamus and the spinal cord, and 
the cat can still maintain itself in relative normality, as long as its environment is 
reasonably constrained. Furthermore, it becomes hyperexploratory. That’s truly staggering, 
in my estimation. Think about it: if you surgically remove 95 percent of a cat’s brain, it 
cannot stop exploring. You would think an essentially brainless cat would just sit there, but 
that’s not what happens. The curious part of its brain is still there. 


*I am aware, of course, that conservatives also have a proclivity to object to big 
government, which seems to contradict the fundamental point I am making. But, in 
Western democracies, that’s primarily because the faith that conservatives manifest in 
culture is predicated more on the eternal verities of the Constitution and the more 
permanent elements of government (so Culture with a capital “C”) than on the too variable 
and too unpredictable whims of whomever might be elected presently, conservative or 
liberal. Likewise, in the same democracies, the liberals tend to look to government for the 
solution to the problems that concern them, but that’s because they believe more in the 
dynamism of the current crop of politicians (particularly, but not only, if they are liberal 
themselves) and less in the eternal verities of the underlying structure. 


“There is little doubt that we create a fair bit of “unnatural” mess while we are doing so 
(another ideological idea, based as it is on the one-sided view of Nature as the victim of our 
rapine and greed), but it’s not as if we are doing it for trivial reasons. That’s why I have 
some sympathy for humanity, as well as for the individuals who compose the mass of 
humanity, and why I cannot find it in my heart to forgive those who say foolish things 
such as “the planet would be better off if there were no people on it.” That’s the genocidal 
element of the radical environmentalist ethos, and it’s a consequence of an ideology that 
sees only the Adversary, the Authoritarian Tyrant, and the Benevolent Mother as the prime 
actors of being. It’s something horrible to behold, if you think it through with any degree of 
depth. 


*If I didn’t say it before, I can certainly say it now: I was and remain in constant awe asa 
consequence of the absolute courage and grace that my wife, for example, manifested in the 
face of her trials in the first six months of 2019, after she was diagnosed with terminal 
cancer (and perhaps cured). Shame, too ... because I am not at all convinced that I could 


have done the same. 


*I have modified the accounts drawn from my clinical practice enough to ensure the 
continuing privacy of my clients while endeavoring to maintain the essential narrative truth 
of what I am relating. 


*€O) 
““Out 
of 
m 
any, O 
, one.” 


*Even rats understand this. Jaak Panksepp, one of the founders of the psychological subfield 
called affective neuroscience and an extremely creative, courageous, and gifted researcher, 
spent many years analyzing the role of play in the development and socialization of rats 
(see J. Panksepp, Affective Neuroscience: The Foundations of Human and Animal 
Emotions [New York: Oxford University Press, 1998], particularly the chapter on play, 
280-99). Rats like to play. They particularly enjoy rough-and-tumble play, particularly if 
they are male juvenile rats. They enjoy it so much that they will voluntarily work—pulling a 
lever repeatedly, say—to gain the opportunity to enter an arena where another juvenile 
waits to play. When two juvenile strangers meet for the first time in this situation, they size 
each other up and then establish dominance. If one rat is only 10 percent larger than the 
other, he can pretty much win every physical contest, every rat wrestling match—but they 
still wrestle to find out, and the larger rat almost inevitably pins the smaller. If you were 
inclined to view the establishment of hierarchy as equivalent to dominance by power, that 
would be game over. The larger, more powerful rat won. End of story. But that is by no 
means the end of the story, unless the rats meet only once. Rats live in social environments, 
and they interact with the same individuals over and over. Thus, the game, once started, 
continues—and the rules have to govern not so much the single game as the repeating one. 
Once dominance is established, the rats can play—something they do in a manner very 
different from genuine fighting (just like play fighting with a pet dog is very different from 
being attacked by a dog). Now, the larger rat could pin the smaller rat every time. However, 
that breaks the rules (really, the meta-rules: those that are observable only over the course 
of repeated games). The purpose of the repeated game is not dominance, but continuing 
play. This is not to say that the initial dominance is without significance. It matters, not 
least in the following manner: When the two rats meet a second time, they will both adopt 
a unique role. The smaller rat is now duty bound to invite his larger friend to play, and the 
larger rat is duty bound to accept the invitation. The former will jump around playfully, to 
indicate his intent. The larger rat might hang back and act cool and a bit dismissive (as is 
now his prerogative); but if he’s a decent sort he will join in the fun, as in his heart of hearts 
he truly wants to play. However—and this is the critical issue—if the larger rat does not let 
the smaller rat win the repeated wrestling matches some substantial proportion of the time 
(Panksepp estimated 30 to 40 percent of the time), the smaller rat will stop exhibiting 
invitations to play. It is just not any fun for the little guy. Thus, if the larger rat dominates 
with power (like a bully), as he could, then he will lose at the highest level (the level where 
the fun continues for the longest possible time), even while he “wins” more frequently at the 
lower. What does this imply? Most important, that power is simply not a stable basis upon 
which to construct a hierarchy designed to optimally govern repeated interactions. And this 
is not just true for rats. Alpha males among at least certain primate groups are far more 
prosocial than their lesser comrades. Power doesn’t work for them, either (see F. B. M. de 
Waal and M. Suchak, “Prosocial Primates: Selfish and Unselfish Motivations,” Philosophical 
Transactions of the Royal Society of London: Biological Science 365 [2010]: 2711-22. See 
also F. de Waal, The Surprising Science of Alpha Males, TEDMED 2017, 

bit.ly/primate ethic). 


*This makes the July 30, 2019, poll from YouGov, “Millennials Are the Loneliest 
Generation” (bit.ly/2TVVMLn), indicating that 25 percent have no acquaintances and 22 
percent no friends, particularly ominous, if true. 


“This is part of the Self-Authoring Suite, a set of individual programs designed to help people 
write about the troubles of their past (Past Authoring), the faults and virtues of their present 
personality (Present Authoring, in two parts), and their desires and wishes for the future 
(Future Authoring). I specifically recommended the latter. 


*You can see this played out, for example, in the proclivity of American evangelical 
Protestants to ask, when faced with a novel existential problem, “What would Jesus do?” It 
is an easy approach to parody, but indicates precisely the values of stories: Once a narrative 
has been internalized, it can be used as a template to generate new perceptions and 
behaviors. It might seem naive or presumptuous to imagine what actions the archetypal 
Savior Himself might undertake in the confines of a normal life, but the fundamental 
purpose of religious narratives is in fact to motivate imitation. 


*All biblical citations are from the King James Version unless otherwise noted. 


*A codex is a book composed of sheets of vellum, papyrus, or most commonly, paper. The 
term is now generally reserved for manuscripts that have been handwritten, as in the case 
of the Codex Bezae. The Codex Bezae contains Greek and Latin versions of Acts and most of 
the four Gospels that are unique in what they additionally include, what they omit, and 
often, the style in which they are written. 


*And don’t think the game can’t be played (isn’t played) in the opposite manner. The same 
applies for femininity, for example, in too many places in the world: in Arabic, for example, 
the word awrah denotes the body’s intimate parts, which must be clothed. The term’s root 
awr means something approximating “weakness,” “imperfection,” or “defectiveness.” 
“Nakedness” is the most common English translation. Other meanings include “falseness,” 
“artificiality,” or “blindness.” According to the dictionary compiled by Mohammad Moin, a 
well-known Iranian scholar of Persian literature and Iranian studies, awrah means both 
“nakedness” or “shame” and “young woman.” In keeping with this network of ideas, the 
word awrat, derived from awrah, has been used widely in various Arabic-influenced 
cultures to signify “woman.” It is for such reasons that women are viewed by those who 
follow the Wahhabi strand of Islam, for example—ultraconservative, austere, and 
puritanical—as sufficiently responsible for the evil and temptation of the world that their 
movements must be drastically and severely restricted, even that they are not allowed to 
show themselves in any important manner in the public sphere. 


*The illness that had destroyed Mikhaila’s ankle, necessitating its replacement, as well as her 
hip, was also immune related, and my wife had some arthritic symptoms that were similar 
to hers. I am mentioning this to shed some light on why the assumption of an immune 


response program sprang to mind and made a certain sense. 


*I had taken serotonin reuptake inhibitors such as Celexa for nearly two decades, greatly 
benefiting from their administration, before stopping in early 2016, because a dramatic 
dietary change seemed to render them unnecessary. 


*It may be of some interest to note that this book and its predecessor—although each stands 
on its own—were also designed jointly to represent the balance they both strive to describe. 
It is for this reason that (in the English-language versions, at least) the first is bound in 
white and the second in black. They constitute a matched set, like the Taoist yin and yang. 


*My YouTube channel can be found at www.youtube.com /user/JordanPetersonVideos. My 
podcast and blog can be accessed at jordanbpeterson.com. 


*A word of advice for anyone seeking mental health help in a large city clinic, where the 
psychiatrist seeing you might take fifteen minutes to assess your life and determine the 
nature of your illness: do not casually mention any odd experiences or beliefs. You may well 
live to regret it. It takes very little to accrue a diagnosis of schizophrenia in the conditions 
that prevail in an overloaded mental health system—and once the diagnosis has been 
established, it is very hard to shake. It is difficult, personally, not to take a medical 
description seriously. It is harder than you might think to disbelieve a qualified psychiatrist 
(who should, after all, know what he or she is talking about), particularly if you are 
experiencing strange symptoms. It is difficult practically, as well, because once such a 
diagnosis becomes part of your permanent medical record, it is very difficult to have it 
modified. Anything out of the ordinary about you will, from then on, attract undue 
attention (even from yourself), and any displays of normality will be downplayed. Now, I 
say all that knowing full well that some people who have odd beliefs are in fact 
schizophrenic—but a fair bit of digging is usually in order to establish that diagnosis, and 
busy psychiatrists in public hospitals seldom have the time for careful excavation. 


*The Past Authoring Program at www.selfauthoring.com. Dr. James W. Pennebaker of the 
University of Texas at Austin, and a host of colleagues working directly with him and 
independently, have demonstrated that writing that reduces existential uncertainty (there’s 
no simpler general way of putting it) reduces anxiety, improves mental health, and boosts 
immunological function. All of these effects appear associated with a general decrease in 
complexity-induced stress and the hormones—harmful in excess—consequentially 
produced. Pennebaker demonstrated, for example, that students who wrote for three days, 
consecutively, about the worst events in their lives experienced, first, a decline in mood (no 
doubt elicited by calling forth such memories) but significant improvement in their lot over 
the period of the following months. Other researchers showed similar effects when students 
wrote about their future. Pennebaker initially assumed that it was something akin to 
emotional expression, or catharsis (following Freud), that produced these positive effects— 
the opportunity to express anger or regret or sorrow—but found, as the result of a careful 
semantic analysis, that it was the development of a cognitive and causal understanding of 
the reason for the events and their significance that was curative. The effects of writing 
about the future seemed similar, in that the plans thereby generated reduced uncertainty 
and put forward a simpler and more well-defined structure around what might otherwise 
have been the intolerably unspecified looming weeks and months ahead. For a review, see 
J. W. Pennebaker and J. F. Evans, Expressive Writing: Words That Heal (Enumclaw, 
Wash.: Idyll Arbor Inc., 2014). 


“Responsibility, stewardship, service; not from physical strength (Cambridge Bible for 
Schools and Colleges); the power of governing and controlling; but most important, the 
same dominion as God has over or for man. 


*Perhaps it is for this reason that Christ insists “it is also written: ‘Do not put the Lord your 
God to the test.” (In this instance I prefer Matthew 4:7 of the New International Version to 
the same verse in the King James Version.) 


“Consider the professional impersonator. He or she doesn’t necessarily copy the precise 
behaviors, movement for movement, of those being impersonated, but the spirit—what’s 
common across all the behaviors of the target celebrity. The same is true when children 
play at being adults. It’s the spirit they’re after, not the individual behaviors. 


*Alchemy—the search for the philosopher’s stone, an artifact that would transform base 
metals into gold, as well as rewarding its bearer with health and immortality—was practiced 
for thousands of years by the misfits, mystics, magicians, and prescientific practitioners who 
took the first fantastical steps toward establishing what eventually became genuine science. 
As alchemy developed, however, the “stone” eventually became conceptualized as 
something more akin to a personality than a material object, as the alchemists increasingly 
realized that the development of the psyche was a more important pursuit than mere gold 
itself. I wrote about this in J. B. Peterson, Maps of Meaning: The Architecture of Belief 
(New York: Routledge, 1999), which contains the relevant references to the work on 
alchemy conducted by Jung and his students. 


“Were going to approach the picture from the very bottom upward, as if each element were 
emerging from the lower. Images of this type (and they are a type) often represent a 
process of psychological or spiritual development or growth, and appear to employ the basic 
symbolism of a plant or a tree extending itself upward as it matures. Something similar can 
be observed in Eastern images of the Buddha, emerging from a lotus flower floating on the 
surface of placid water, with its stalk extending into the murky deep underneath and its 
roots grounded far, far below even that, into the mud that composes the lowest level of the 
depths. 


*As gold is both rare and unwilling, so to speak, to combine promiscuously with other 
elements or compounds. 


*It is of some real interest to note—particularly in relationship to the discussion of the 
dangers of creativity presented in Rule I—that the Seekers chase the Snitch both inside and 
outside the playing field that provides boundaries for all the other players. While outside, 
they can careen through the wooden foundation of the Quidditch stadium. This would not 
be a problem, if they weren’t simultaneously being chased by a Bludger, a solid, massive, 
flying ball capable not only of knocking them off their brooms, but of crashing through and 
seriously damaging that same structure. If they succeed in catching the Snitch, as we have 
indicated, they generally attain victory. But they risk damaging the very foundations of the 
game while doing so—just as creative people do when they pursue their innovative yet 
disruptive visions. 


*It is also of great interest to note, in this regard, that the metal mercury can be used in the 
mining and purification of gold. Gold dissolves in mercury, and mercury can, therefore, be 
used to draw out the small amounts of the precious metal typically found in ores. The 
mercury is then boiled off (it has a low boiling point) so that only the gold remains. The 
proclivity of mercury for gold has given rise to the symbolic idea that the liquid metal has 
an “affinity” for what is most precious: that mercury will seek what is noble and pure and 
incorruptible—like gold itself, speaking symbolically once again—and concentrate it in 
usable amounts. So, the fundamental idea is that the pursuit of meaning, guided by 
Mercury, messenger of the gods (the unconscious, as far as modern people are concerned), 
will enable the Seeker to collect what is, like gold, of the highest value. For the alchemists 
who created drawings like the one we are analyzing, that highest value came to be the 
ultimate development of the psyche, or spirit, or personality. 


*This is part of the reason science developed so long after religion and ritual—so incredibly 
recently, and by no means everywhere at once. 


*Furthermore, in the mythological world, unlike the objective, logical world, things can be 
one thing and their opposite at the same time. And this representation in the mythological 
world is more accurate than the objective, in the experiential manner described previously: 
Nature, for example, is Creator and Destroyer, just as Culture is Protector and Tyrant. It 
might be objected: Nature and Culture are not singular things. They can be differentiated, 
so that their paradoxical components are separated, understood, and dealt with. This is all 
true: but the paradoxical components are often experienced simultaneously and so unified. 
This occurs when anyone is betrayed, for example, in a love affair. Beast and man, Medusa 
and beloved woman are often united experientially in the same hypothetically unitary 
figure. This can be a terrible discovery when made in real life. 


*The same idea is expressed in Taoist cosmogony, when the yin and the yang differentiate 
themselves into the five elements: wood, fire, earth, metal, and water. The ancient Greeks 
believed, similarly, that Earth and Sky (Gaia and Uranus) gave birth to the Titans, 


elemental deities of great strength and power. 


*E pluribus unum. 


*Ea makes man from the blood of Kingu, the most terrible of Tiamat’s monsters. A bright 
graduate student and later colleague of mine once suggested that this was because of all 
God’s creatures, only man could deceive; only man could voluntarily bring evil and discord 


into the world. 


*It has been known for decades, explicitly (and forever, implicitly) that self-initiated 
confrontation with what is frightening or unknown is frequently curative. The standard 
treatment for phobias and anxiety is therefore exposure to what is feared. That treatment is 
effective—but the exposure must be voluntary. It is as if the anxiety systems of the brain 
assume that anything that is advanced upon must not be a predator (or, if it is a predator, it 
is the sort that can be easily kicked to the side and defeated). We now know that even the 
emotional and bodily response to stress differs completely when that stress is voluntarily 
faced rather than accidentally encountered. In the latter case, the threatened individual 
tenses up and readies him or herself defensively (see M. D. Seery, “Challenge or Threat? 
Cardiovascular Indexes of Resilience and Vulnerability to Potential Stress in Humans,” 
Neuroscience & Biobehavioral Reviews 35 [2011]: 1603—4). That can become the 
chronically unhealthy posture of someone turned to stone. In the former case, the 
individual takes on the role of probable victor, and advances forthrightly. Such actions are 
indeed what has always saved humanity from the terrors of the night (and the evil lurking 
in the human heart). Our continual observation of that fact, over millennia, is what 
allowed us to represent it, abstractly, in our great religious stories, and then to imitate it, 
within the confines of our particular and unique life. 


*This is at least in part because you are very unlikely to have already looked there, even 
though it would have been useful to do so. 


*Something must be further clarified here. I made the case in the Overture, in Rule I, in 12 
Rules for Life, and in Maps of Meaning that chaos tends to find its representation in 
symbolic form as feminine—but here I am talking about chaos, in serpentine guise. I can 
explain this by elaborating on my explanation about the alchemical picture we discussed 
earlier—by reading it from the top down, however, this time. The more profound the threat 
—the deeper the chaos—the more likely that it will represent itself as mankind’s most 
ancient enemy, the serpent. Perhaps it can be thought of like this: the unknown unknowns 
—those elements of being that are foreign and dangerous beyond imagination, and whose 
manifestation can kill or destroy psychologically—are those most likely to be represented in 
serpentine form. Out of this domain, which is in some important sense even more 
fundamental than sex itself, emerges the primordial feminine and masculine, although it 
seems that the feminine nonetheless retains a more primary connection with the 
fundamental unknowable itself. I think this has to do primarily with the absolute mystery 
of birth: with the relationship between the emergence of new forms from the feminine and 
the emergence of new forms from the absolutely unknown. It is perhaps something of this 
sort that accounts for the primacy of the relationship between the snake in the Garden of 
Eden and Eve, rather than between the snake and Adam. Perhaps, as well (and I am 
speculating wildly here, trying to move beyond my ignorance, trying to account for the 
clear and omnipresent symbolic relationship), it has forever been the case that females 
attract snakes (as well as other dangerous predators), most particularly when they are 
taking care of their young, and that the heightened danger they therefore face has burned 
the danger of the feminine in relationship to the serpentine forever in our imagination. This 
would imply that the decision to take on a relationship with a female brings with it 
increased exposure to the terrible unknown (something that seems clearly true in the case 
of all the threats that are faced by children), as perhaps does the fact of being female itself. 
Now the female is also a rejecting force (particularly among humans, where the females 
are very choosy maters [see, for example, Y. Bokek-Cohen, Y. Peres, and S. Kanazawa, 
“Rational Choice and Evolutionary Psychology as Explanations for Mate Selectivity,” 
Journal of Social, Evolutionary, and Cultural Psychology 2 (2008): 42—55]). That holding 
of the power of ultimate rejection makes Nature in all its cruelty (and, it must be said, 
wisdom). Perhaps that is also a nontrivial contributor to the feminine-serpent relationship.

Foreword 


Rules?  More  rules?  Really?  Isn’t  life  complicated  enough,  restricting  enough, 
without  abstract  rules  that  don’t  take  our  unique,  individual  situations  into 
account?  And  given  that  our  brains  are  plastic,  and  all  develop  differently  based 
on  our  life  experiences,  why  even  expect  that  a  few  rules  might  be  helpful  to  us 
all? 

People  don’t  clamour  for  rules,  even  in  the  Bible  ...  as  when  Moses  comes 
down  the  mountain,  after  a  long  absence,  bearing  the  tablets  inscribed  with  ten 
commandments,  and  finds  the  Children  of  Israel  in  revelry.  They’d  been 
Pharaoh’s  slaves  and  subject  to  his  tyrannical  regulations  for  four  hundred  years, 
and  after  that  Moses  subjected  them  to  the  harsh  desert  wilderness  for  another 
forty  years,  to  purify  them  of  their  slavishness.  Now,  free  at  last,  they  are 
unbridled,  and  have  lost  all  control  as  they  dance  wildly  around  an  idol,  a  golden 
calf,  displaying  all  manner  of  corporeal  corruption. 

“I’ve  got  some  good  news  ...  and  I’ve  got  some  bad  news,”  the  lawgiver  yells 
to  them.  “Which  do  you  want  first?” 

“The  good  news!”  the  hedonists  reply. 

“I  got  Him  from  fifteen  commandments  down  to  ten!” 

“Hallelujah!”  cries  the  unruly  crowd.  “And  the  bad?” 

“Adultery  is  still  in.” 

So  rules  there  will  be — but,  please,  not  too  many.  We  are  ambivalent  about 
rules,  even  when  we  know  they  are  good  for  us.  If  we  are  spirited  souls,  if  we 
have  character,  rules  seem  restrictive,  an  affront  to  our  sense  of  agency  and  our 
pride  in  working  out  our  own  lives.  Why  should  we  be  judged  according  to 
another’s  rule? 

And  judged  we  are.  After  all,  God  didn’t  give  Moses  “The  Ten  Suggestions,” 
he  gave  Commandments;  and  if  I’m  a  free  agent,  my  first  reaction  to  a  command 
might  just  be  that  nobody,  not  even  God,  tells  me  what  to  do,  even  if  it’s  good 
for  me.  But  the  story  of  the  golden  calf  also  reminds  us  that  without  rules  we 
quickly  become  slaves  to  our  passions — and  there’s  nothing  freeing  about  that. 

And  the  story  suggests  something  more:  unchaperoned,  and  left  to  our  own 
untutored  judgment,  we  are  quick  to  aim  low  and  worship  qualities  that  are 


beneath  us — in  this  case,  an  artificial  animal  that  brings  out  our  own  animal 
instincts  in  a  completely  unregulated  way.  The  old  Hebrew  story  makes  it  clear 
how  the  ancients  felt  about  our  prospects  for  civilized  behaviour  in  the  absence 
of  rules  that  seek  to  elevate  our  gaze  and  raise  our  standards. 

One  neat  thing  about  the  Bible  story  is  that  it  doesn’t  simply  list  its  rules,  as 
lawyers  or  legislators  or  administrators  might;  it  embeds  them  in  a  dramatic  tale 
that  illustrates  why  we  need  them,  thereby  making  them  easier  to  understand. 
Similarly,  in  this  book  Professor  Peterson  doesn’t  just  propose  his  twelve  rules, 
he  tells  stories,  too,  bringing  to  bear  his  knowledge  of  many  fields  as  he 
illustrates  and  explains  why  the  best  rules  do  not  ultimately  restrict  us  but 
instead  facilitate  our  goals  and  make  for  fuller,  freer  lives. 

The  first  time  I  met  Jordan  Peterson  was  on  September  12,  2004,  at  the  home  of 
two  mutual  friends,  TV  producer  Wodek  Szemberg  and  medical  internist  Estera 
Bekier.  It  was  Wodek’s  birthday  party.  Wodek  and  Estera  are  Polish  emigres  who 
grew  up  within  the  Soviet  empire,  where  it  was  understood  that  many  topics 
were  off  limits,  and  that  casually  questioning  certain  social  arrangements  and 
philosophical  ideas  (not  to  mention  the  regime  itself)  could  mean  big  trouble. 

But  now,  host  and  hostess  luxuriated  in  easygoing,  honest  talk,  by  having 
elegant  parties  devoted  to  the  pleasure  of  saying  what  you  really  thought  and 
hearing  others  do  the  same,  in  an  uninhibited  give-and-take.  Here,  the  rule  was 
“Speak  your  mind.”  If  the  conversation  turned  to  politics,  people  of  different 
political  persuasions  spoke  to  each  other — indeed,  looked  forward  to  it — in  a 
manner  that  is  increasingly  rare.  Sometimes  Wodek’s  own  opinions,  or  truths, 
exploded  out  of  him,  as  did  his  laugh.  Then  he’d  hug  whoever  had  made  him 
laugh  or  provoked  him  to  speak  his  mind  with  greater  intensity  than  even  he 
might  have  intended.  This  was  the  best  part  of  the  parties,  and  this  frankness, 
and  his  warm  embraces,  made  it  worth  provoking  him.  Meanwhile,  Estera’s 
voice  lilted  across  the  room  on  a  very  precise  path  towards  its  intended  listener. 
Truth  explosions  didn’t  make  the  atmosphere  any  less  easygoing  for  the 
company — they  made  for  more  truth  explosions! — liberating  us,  and  more 
laughs,  and  making  the  whole  evening  more  pleasant,  because  with  de¬ 
repressing  Eastern  Europeans  like  the  Szemberg-Bekiers,  you  always  knew  with 
what  and  with  whom  you  were  dealing,  and  that  frankness  was  enlivening. 
Honore  de  Balzac,  the  novelist,  once  described  the  balls  and  parties  in  his  native 
France,  observing  that  what  appeared  to  be  a  single  party  was  always  really  two. 
In  the  first  hours,  the  gathering  was  suffused  with  bored  people  posing  and 
posturing,  and  attendees  who  came  to  meet  perhaps  one  special  person  who 
would  confirm  them  in  their  beauty  and  status.  Then,  only  in  the  very  late  hours, 


after  most  of  the  guests  had  left,  would  the  second  party,  the  real  party,  begin. 
Here  the  conversation  was  shared  by  each  person  present,  and  open-hearted 
laughter  replaced  the  starchy  airs.  At  Estera  and  Wodek’s  parties,  this  kind  of 
wee-hours-of-the-morning  disclosure  and  intimacy  often  began  as  soon  as  we 
entered  the  room. 

Wodek  is  a  silver-haired,  lion-maned  hunter,  always  on  the  lookout  for 
potential  public  intellectuals,  who  knows  how  to  spot  people  who  can  really  talk 
in  front  of  a  TV  camera  and  who  look  authentic  because  they  are  (the  camera 
picks  up  on  that).  He  often  invites  such  people  to  these  salons.  That  day  Wodek 
brought  a  psychology  professor,  from  my  own  University  of  Toronto,  who  fit  the 
bill:  intellect  and  emotion  in  tandem.  Wodek  was  the  first  to  put  Jordan  Peterson 
in  front  of  a  camera,  and  thought  of  him  as  a  teacher  in  search  of  students — 
because  he  was  always  ready  to  explain.  And  it  helped  that  he  liked  the  camera 
and  that  the  camera  liked  him  back. 

That  afternoon  there  was  a  large  table  set  outside  in  the  Szemberg-Bekiers’ 
garden;  around  it  was  gathered  the  usual  collection  of  lips  and  ears,  and 
loquacious  virtuosos.  We  seemed,  however,  to  be  plagued  by  a  buzzing 
paparazzi  of  bees,  and  here  was  this  new  fellow  at  the  table,  with  an  Albertan 
accent,  in  cowboy  boots,  who  was  ignoring  them,  and  kept  on  talking.  He  kept 
talking  while  the  rest  of  us  were  playing  musical  chairs  to  keep  away  from  the 
pests,  yet  also  trying  to  remain  at  the  table  because  this  new  addition  to  our 
gatherings  was  so  interesting. 

He  had  this  odd  habit  of  speaking  about  the  deepest  questions  to  whoever  was 
at  this  table — most  of  them  new  acquaintances — as  though  he  were  just  making 
small  talk.  Or,  if  he  did  do  small  talk,  the  interval  between  “How  do  you  know 
Wodek  and  Estera?”  or  “I  was  a  beekeeper  once,  so  I’m  used  to  them”  and  more 
serious  topics  would  be  nanoseconds. 

One  might  hear  such  questions  discussed  at  parties  where  professors  and 
professionals  gather,  but  usually  the  conversation  would  remain  between  two 
specialists  in  the  topic,  off  in  a  corner,  or  if  shared  with  the  whole  group  it  was 
often  not  without  someone  preening.  But  this  Peterson,  though  erudite,  didn’t 
come  across  as  a  pedant.  He  had  the  enthusiasm  of  a  kid  who  had  just  learned 
something  new  and  had  to  share  it.  He  seemed  to  be  assuming,  as  a  child  would 
— before  learning  how  dulled  adults  can  become — that  if  he  thought  something 
was  interesting,  then  so  might  others.  There  was  something  boyish  in  the 
cowboy,  in  his  broaching  of  subjects  as  though  we  had  all  grown  up  together  in 
the  same  small  town,  or  family,  and  had  all  been  thinking  about  the  very  same 
problems  of  human  existence  all  along. 


Peterson  wasn’t  really  an  “eccentric”;  he  had  sufficient  conventional  chops, 
had  been  a  Harvard  professor,  was  a  gentleman  (as  cowboys  can  be)  though  he 
did  say  damn  and  bloody  a  lot,  in  a  rural  1950s  sort  of  way.  But  everyone 
listened,  with  fascination  on  their  faces,  because  he  was  in  fact  addressing 
questions  of  concern  to  everyone  at  the  table. 

There  was  something  freeing  about  being  with  a  person  so  learned  yet 
speaking  in  such  an  unedited  way.  His  thinking  was  motoric;  it  seemed  he 
needed  to  think  aloud,  to  use  his  motor  cortex  to  think,  but  that  motor  also  had  to 
mn  fast  to  work  properly.  To  get  to  liftoff.  Not  quite  manic,  but  his  idling  speed 
revved  high.  Spirited  thoughts  were  tumbling  out.  But  unlike  many  academics 
who  take  the  floor  and  hold  it,  if  someone  challenged  or  corrected  him  he  really 
seemed  to  like  it.  He  didn’t  rear  up  and  neigh.  He’d  say,  in  a  kind  of  folksy  way, 
“Yeah,”  and  bow  his  head  involuntarily,  wag  it  if  he  had  overlooked  something, 
laughing  at  himself  for  overgeneralizing.  He  appreciated  being  shown  another 
side  of  an  issue,  and  it  became  clear  that  thinking  through  a  problem  was,  for 
him,  a  dialogic  process. 

One  could  not  but  be  struck  by  another  unusual  thing  about  him:  for  an 
egghead  Peterson  was  extremely  practical.  His  examples  were  filled  with 
applications  to  everyday  life:  business  management,  how  to  make  furniture  (he 
made  much  of  his  own),  designing  a  simple  house,  making  a  room  beautiful 
(now  an  internet  meme)  or  in  another,  specific  case  related  to  education,  creating 
an  online  writing  project  that  kept  minority  students  from  dropping  out  of  school 
by  getting  them  to  do  a  kind  of  psychoanalytic  exercise  on  themselves,  in  which 
they  would  free-associate  about  their  past,  present  and  future  (now  known  as  the 
Self- Authoring  Program). 

I  was  always  especially  fond  of  mid- Western,  Prairie  types  who  come  from  a 
farm  (where  they  learned  all  about  nature),  or  from  a  very  small  town,  and  who 
have  worked  with  their  hands  to  make  things,  spent  long  periods  outside  in  the 
harsh  elements,  and  are  often  self-educated  and  go  to  university  against  the  odds. 
I  found  them  quite  unlike  their  sophisticated  but  somewhat  denatured  urban 
counterparts,  for  whom  higher  education  was  pre-ordained,  and  for  that  reason 
sometimes  taken  for  granted,  or  thought  of  not  as  an  end  in  itself  but  simply  as  a 
life  stage  in  the  service  of  career  advancement.  These  Westerners  were  different: 
self-made,  unentitled,  hands  on,  neighbourly  and  less  precious  than  many  of 
their  big-city  peers,  who  increasingly  spend  their  lives  indoors,  manipulating 
symbols  on  computers.  This  cowboy  psychologist  seemed  to  care  about  a 
thought  only  if  it  might,  in  some  way,  be  helpful  to  someone. 


We  became  friends.  As  a  psychiatrist  and  psychoanalyst  who  loves  literature,  I 
was  drawn  to  him  because  here  was  a  clinician  who  also  had  given  himself  a 
great  books  education,  and  who  not  only  loved  soulful  Russian  novels, 
philosophy  and  ancient  mythology,  but  who  also  seemed  to  treat  them  as  his 
most  treasured  inheritance.  But  he  also  did  illuminating  statistical  research  on 
personality  and  temperament,  and  had  studied  neuroscience.  Though  trained  as  a 
behaviourist,  he  was  powerfully  drawn  to  psychoanalysis  with  its  focus  on 
dreams,  archetypes,  the  persistence  of  childhood  conflicts  in  the  adult,  and  the 
role  of  defences  and  rationalization  in  everyday  life.  He  was  also  an  outlier  in 
being  the  only  member  of  the  research-oriented  Department  of  Psychology  at  the 
University  of  Toronto  who  also  kept  a  clinical  practice. 

On  my  visits,  our  conversations  began  with  banter  and  laughter — that  was  the 
small-town  Peterson  from  the  Alberta  hinterland — his  teenage  years  right  out  of 
the  movie  FUBAR — welcoming  you  into  his  home.  The  house  had  been  gutted 
by  Tammy,  his  wife,  and  himself,  and  turned  into  perhaps  the  most  fascinating 
and  shocking  middle-class  home  I  had  seen.  They  had  art,  some  carved  masks, 
and  abstract  portraits,  but  they  were  overwhelmed  by  a  huge  collection  of 
original  Socialist  Realist  paintings  of  Lenin  and  the  early  Communists 
commissioned  by  the  USSR.  Not  long  after  the  Soviet  Union  fell,  and  most  of 
the  world  breathed  a  sigh  of  relief,  Peterson  began  purchasing  this  propaganda 
for  a  song  online.  Paintings  lionizing  the  Soviet  revolutionary  spirit  completely 
filled  every  single  wall,  the  ceilings,  even  the  bathrooms.  The  paintings  were  not 
there  because  Jordan  had  any  totalitarian  sympathies,  but  because  he  wanted  to 
remind  himself  of  something  he  knew  he  and  everyone  would  rather  forget:  that 
hundreds  of  millions  were  murdered  in  the  name  of  utopia. 

It  took  getting  used  to,  this  semi-haunted  house  “decorated”  by  a  delusion  that 
had  practically  destroyed  mankind.  But  it  was  eased  by  his  wonderful  and 
unique  spouse,  Tammy,  who  was  all  in,  who  embraced  and  encouraged  this 
unusual  need  for  expression!  These  paintings  provided  a  visitor  with  the  first 
window  onto  the  full  extent  of  Jordan’s  concern  about  our  human  capacity  for 
evil  in  the  name  of  good,  and  the  psychological  mystery  of  self-deception  (how 
can  a  person  deceive  himself  and  get  away  with  it?) — an  interest  we  share.  And 
then  there  were  also  the  hours  we’d  spend  discussing  what  I  might  call  a  lesser 
problem  (lesser  because  rarer),  the  human  capacity  for  evil  for  the  sake  of  evil, 
the  joy  some  people  take  in  destroying  others,  captured  famously  by  the 
seventeenth-century  English  poet  John  Milton  in  Paradise  Lost. 

And  so  we’d  chat  and  have  our  tea  in  his  kitchen-underworld,  walled  by  this 
odd  art  collection,  a  visual  marker  of  his  earnest  quest  to  move  beyond  simplistic 
ideology,  left  or  right,  and  not  repeat  mistakes  of  the  past.  After  a  while,  there 


was  nothing  peculiar  about  taking  tea  in  the  kitchen,  discussing  family  issues, 
one’s  latest  reading,  with  those  ominous  pictures  hovering.  It  was  just  living  in 
the  world  as  it  was,  or  in  some  places,  is. 

In  Jordan’s  first  and  only  book  before  this  one,  Maps  of  Meaning,  he  shares  his 
profound  insights  into  universal  themes  of  world  mythology,  and  explains  how 
all  cultures  have  created  stories  to  help  us  grapple  with,  and  ultimately  map,  the 
chaos  into  which  we  are  thrown  at  birth;  this  chaos  is  everything  that  is  unknown 
to  us,  and  any  unexplored  territory  that  we  must  traverse,  be  it  in  the  world 
outside  or  the  psyche  within. 

Combining  evolution,  the  neuroscience  of  emotion,  some  of  the  best  of  Jung, 
some  of  Freud,  much  of  the  great  works  of  Nietzsche,  Dostoevsky,  Solzhenitsyn, 
Eliade,  Neumann,  Piaget,  Frye  and  Frankl,  Maps  of  Meaning,  published  nearly 
two  decades  ago,  shows  Jordan’s  wide-ranging  approach  to  understanding  how 
human  beings  and  the  human  brain  deal  with  the  archetypal  situation  that  arises 
whenever  we,  in  our  daily  lives,  must  face  something  we  do  not  understand.  The 
brilliance  of  the  book  is  in  his  demonstration  of  how  rooted  this  situation  is  in 
evolution,  our  DNA,  our  brains  and  our  most  ancient  stories.  And  he  shows  that 
these  stories  have  survived  because  they  still  provide  guidance  in  dealing  with 
uncertainty,  and  the  unavoidable  unknown. 

One  of  the  many  virtues  of  the  book  you  are  reading  now  is  that  it  provides  an 
entry  point  into  Maps  of  Meaning,  which  is  a  highly  complex  work  because 
Jordan  was  working  out  his  approach  to  psychology  as  he  wrote  it.  But  it  was 
foundational,  because  no  matter  how  different  our  genes  or  life  experiences  may 
be,  or  how  differently  our  plastic  brains  are  wired  by  our  experience,  we  all  have 
to  deal  with  the  unknown,  and  we  all  attempt  to  move  from  chaos  to  order.  And 
this  is  why  many  of  the  rules  in  this  book,  being  based  on  Maps  of  Meaning, 
have  an  element  of  universality  to  them. 

Maps  of  Meaning  was  sparked  by  Jordan’s  agonized  awareness,  as  a  teenager 
growing  up  in  the  midst  of  the  Cold  War,  that  much  of  mankind  seemed  on  the 
verge  of  blowing  up  the  planet  to  defend  their  various  identities.  He  felt  he  had 
to  understand  how  it  could  be  that  people  would  sacrifice  everything  for  an 
“identity,”  whatever  that  was.  And  he  felt  he  had  to  understand  the  ideologies 
that  drove  totalitarian  regimes  to  a  variant  of  that  same  behaviour:  killing  their 
own  citizens.  In  Maps  of  Meaning,  and  again  in  this  book,  one  of  the  matters  he 
cautions  readers  to  be  most  wary  of  is  ideology,  no  matter  who  is  peddling  it  or 
to  what  end. 


Ideologies  are  simple  ideas,  disguised  as  science  or  philosophy,  that  purport  to 
explain  the  complexity  of  the  world  and  offer  remedies  that  will  perfect  it. 
Ideologues  are  people  who  pretend  they  know  how  to  “make  the  world  a  better 
place”  before  they’ve  taken  care  of  their  own  chaos  within.  (The  warrior  identity 
that  their  ideology  gives  them  covers  over  that  chaos.)  That’s  hubris,  of  course, 
and  one  of  the  most  important  themes  of  this  book,  is  “set  your  house  in  order” 
first,  and  Jordan  provides  practical  advice  on  how  to  do  this. 

Ideologies  are  substitutes  for  true  knowledge,  and  ideologues  are  always 
dangerous  when  they  come  to  power,  because  a  simple-minded  I-know-it-all 
approach  is  no  match  for  the  complexity  of  existence.  Furthermore,  when  their 
social  contraptions  fail  to  fly,  ideologues  blame  not  themselves  but  all  who  see 
through  the  simplifications.  Another  great  U  of  T  professor,  Lewis  Feuer,  in  his 
book  Ideology  and  the  Ideologists,  observed  that  ideologies  retool  the  very 
religious  stories  they  purport  to  have  supplanted,  but  eliminate  the  narrative  and 
psychological  richness.  Communism  borrowed  from  the  story  of  the  Children  of 
Israel  in  Egypt,  with  an  enslaved  class,  rich  persecutors,  a  leader,  like  Lenin, 
who  goes  abroad,  lives  among  the  enslavers,  and  then  leads  the  enslaved  to  the 
promised  land  (the  utopia;  the  dictatorship  of  the  proletariat). 

To  understand  ideology,  Jordan  read  extensively  about  not  only  the  Soviet 
gulag,  but  also  the  Holocaust  and  the  rise  of  Nazism.  I  had  never  before  met  a 
person,  born  Christian  and  of  my  generation,  who  was  so  utterly  tormented  by 
what  happened  in  Europe  to  the  Jews,  and  who  had  worked  so  hard  to 
understand  how  it  could  have  occurred.  I  too  had  studied  this  in  depth.  My  own 
father  survived  Auschwitz.  My  grandmother  was  middle-aged  when  she  stood 
face  to  face  with  Dr.  Josef  Mengele,  the  Nazi  physician  who  conducted 
unspeakably  cruel  experiments  on  his  victims,  and  she  survived  Auschwitz  by 
disobeying  his  order  to  join  the  line  with  the  elderly,  the  grey  and  the  weak,  and 
instead  slipping  into  a  line  with  younger  people.  She  avoided  the  gas  chambers  a 
second  time  by  trading  food  for  hair  dye  so  she  wouldn’t  be  murdered  for 
looking  too  old.  My  grandfather,  her  husband,  survived  the  Mauthausen 
concentration  camp,  but  choked  to  death  on  the  first  piece  of  solid  food  he  was 
given,  just  before  liberation  day.  I  relate  this,  because  years  after  we  became 
friends,  when  Jordan  would  take  a  classical  liberal  stand  for  free  speech,  he 
would  be  accused  by  left-wing  extremists  as  being  a  right-wing  bigot. 

Let  me  say,  with  all  the  moderation  I  can  summon:  at  best,  those  accusers 
have  simply  not  done  their  due  diligence.  I  have;  with  a  family  history  such  as 
mine,  one  develops  not  only  radar,  but  underwater  sonar  for  right-wing  bigotry; 
but  even  more  important,  one  learns  to  recognize  the  kind  of  person  with  the 


comprehension,  tools,  good  will  and  courage  to  combat  it,  and  Jordan  Peterson  is 
that  person. 

My  own  dissatisfaction  with  modern  political  science’s  attempts  to  understand 
the  rise  of  Nazism,  totalitarianism  and  prejudice  was  a  major  factor  in  my 
decision  to  supplement  my  studies  of  political  science  with  the  study  of  the 
unconscious,  projection,  psychoanalysis,  the  regressive  potential  of  group 
psychology,  psychiatry  and  the  brain.  Jordan  switched  out  of  political  science  for 
similar  reasons.  With  these  important  parallel  interests,  we  didn’t  always  agree 
on  “the  answers”  (thank  God),  but  we  almost  always  agreed  on  the  questions. 

Our  friendship  wasn’t  all  doom  and  gloom.  I  have  made  a  habit  of  attending 
my  fellow  professors’  classes  at  our  university,  and  so  attended  his,  which  were 
always  packed,  and  I  saw  what  now  millions  have  seen  online:  a  brilliant,  often 
dazzling  public  speaker  who  was  at  his  best  riffing  like  a  jazz  artist;  at  times  he 
resembled  an  ardent  Prairie  preacher  (not  in  evangelizing,  but  in  his  passion,  in 
his  ability  to  tell  stories  that  convey  the  life-stakes  that  go  with  believing  or 
disbelieving  various  ideas).  Then  he’d  just  as  easily  switch  to  do  a 
breathtakingly  systematic  summary  of  a  series  of  scientific  studies.  He  was  a 
master  at  helping  students  become  more  reflective,  and  take  themselves  and  their 
futures  seriously.  He  taught  them  to  respect  many  of  the  greatest  books  ever 
written.  He  gave  vivid  examples  from  clinical  practice,  was  (appropriately)  self- 
revealing,  even  of  his  own  vulnerabilities,  and  made  fascinating  links  between 
evolution,  the  brain  and  religious  stories.  In  a  world  where  students  are  taught  to 
see  evolution  and  religion  as  simply  opposed  (by  thinkers  like  Richard 
Dawkins),  Jordan  showed  his  students  how  evolution,  of  all  things,  helps  to 
explain  the  profound  psychological  appeal  and  wisdom  of  many  ancient  stories, 
from  Gilgamesh  to  the  life  of  the  Buddha,  Egyptian  mythology  and  the  Bible.  He 
showed,  for  instance,  how  stories  about  journeying  voluntarily  into  the  unknown 
— the  hero’s  quest — mirror  universal  tasks  for  which  the  brain  evolved.  He 
respected  the  stories,  was  not  reductionist,  and  never  claimed  to  exhaust  their 
wisdom.  If  he  discussed  a  topic  such  as  prejudice,  or  its  emotional  relatives  fear 
and  disgust,  or  the  differences  between  the  sexes  on  average,  he  was  able  to 
show  how  these  traits  evolved  and  why  they  survived. 

Above  all,  he  alerted  his  students  to  topics  rarely  discussed  in  university,  such 
as  the  simple  fact  that  all  the  ancients,  from  Buddha  to  the  biblical  authors,  knew 
what  every  slightly  worn-out  adult  knows,  that  life  is  suffering.  If  you  are 
suffering,  or  someone  close  to  you  is,  that’s  sad.  But  alas,  it’s  not  particularly 
special.  We  don’t  suffer  only  because  “politicians  are  dimwitted,”  or  “the  system 
is  corrupt,”  or  because  you  and  I,  like  almost  everyone  else,  can  legitimately 
describe  ourselves,  in  some  way,  as  a  victim  of  something  or  someone.  It  is 


because  we  are  bom  human  that  we  are  guaranteed  a  good  dose  of  suffering. 

And  chances  are,  if  you  or  someone  you  love  is  not  suffering  now,  they  will  be 
within  five  years,  unless  you  are  freakishly  lucky.  Rearing  kids  is  hard,  work  is 
hard,  aging,  sickness  and  death  are  hard,  and  Jordan  emphasized  that  doing  all 
that  totally  on  your  own,  without  the  benefit  of  a  loving  relationship,  or  wisdom, 
or  the  psychological  insights  of  the  greatest  psychologists,  only  makes  it  harder. 
He  wasn’t  scaring  the  students;  in  fact,  they  found  this  frank  talk  reassuring, 
because  in  the  depths  of  their  psyches,  most  of  them  knew  what  he  said  was  true, 
even  if  there  was  never  a  forum  to  discuss  it — perhaps  because  the  adults  in  their 
lives  had  become  so  naively  overprotective  that  they  deluded  themselves  into 
thinking  that  not  talking  about  suffering  would  in  some  way  magically  protect 
their  children  from  it. 

Here  he  would  relate  the  myth  of  the  hero,  a  cross-cultural  theme  explored 
psychoanalytically  by  Otto  Rank,  who  noted,  following  Freud,  that  hero  myths 
are  similar  in  many  cultures,  a  theme  that  was  picked  up  by  Carl  Jung,  Joseph 
Campbell  and  Erich  Neumann,  among  others.  Where  Freud  made  great 
contributions  in  explaining  neuroses  by,  among  other  things,  focusing  on 
understanding  what  we  might  call  a  failed-hero  story  (that  of  Oedipus),  Jordan 
focused  on  triumphant  heroes.  In  all  these  triumph  stories,  the  hero  has  to  go  into 
the  unknown,  into  an  unexplored  territory,  and  deal  with  a  new  great  challenge 
and  take  great  risks.  In  the  process,  something  of  himself  has  to  die,  or  be  given 
up,  so  he  can  be  reborn  and  meet  the  challenge.  This  requires  courage, 
something  rarely  discussed  in  a  psychology  class  or  textbook.  During  his  recent 
public  stand  for  free  speech  and  against  what  I  call  “forced  speech”  (because  it 
involves  a  government  forcing  citizens  to  voice  political  views),  the  stakes  were 
very  high;  he  had  much  to  lose,  and  knew  it.  Nonetheless,  I  saw  him  (and 
Tammy,  for  that  matter)  not  only  display  such  courage,  but  also  continue  to  live 
by  many  of  the  rules  in  this  book,  some  of  which  can  be  very  demanding. 

I  saw  him  grow,  from  the  remarkable  person  he  was,  into  someone  even  more 
able  and  assured — through  living  by  these  rules.  In  fact,  it  was  the  process  of 
writing  this  book,  and  developing  these  rules,  that  led  him  to  take  the  stand  he 
did  against  forced  or  compelled  speech.  And  that  is  why,  during  those  events,  he 
started  posting  some  of  his  thoughts  about  life  and  these  rules  on  the  internet. 
Now,  over  100  million  YouTube  hits  later,  we  know  they  have  struck  a  chord. 

Given  our  distaste  for  rules,  how  do  we  explain  the  extraordinary  response  to  his 
lectures,  which  give  rules?  In  Jordan’s  case,  it  was  of  course  his  charisma  and  a 
rare  willingness  to  stand  for  a  principle  that  got  him  a  wide  hearing  online 
initially;  views  of  his  first  YouTube  statements  quickly  numbered  in  the 


hundreds  of  thousands.  But  people  have  kept  listening  because  what  he  is  saying 
meets  a  deep  and  unarticulated  need.  And  that  is  because  alongside  our  wish  to 
be  free  of  rules,  we  all  search  for  structure. 

The  hunger  among  many  younger  people  for  rules,  or  at  least  guidelines,  is 
greater  today  for  good  reason.  In  the  West  at  least,  millennials  are  living  through 
a  unique  historical  situation.  They  are,  I  believe,  the  first  generation  to  have  been 
so  thoroughly  taught  two  seemingly  contradictory  ideas  about  morality, 
simultaneously — at  their  schools,  colleges  and  universities,  by  many  in  my  own 
generation.  This  contradiction  has  left  them  at  times  disoriented  and  uncertain, 
without  guidance  and,  more  tragically,  deprived  of  riches  they  don’t  even  know 
exist. 

The  first  idea  or  teaching  is  that  morality  is  relative,  at  best  a  personal  “value 
judgment.”  Relative  means  that  there  is  no  absolute  right  or  wrong  in  anything; 
instead,  morality  and  the  rules  associated  with  it  are  just  a  matter  of  personal 
opinion  or  happenstance,  “relative  to”  or  “related  to”  a  particular  framework, 
such  as  one’s  ethnicity,  one’s  upbringing,  or  the  culture  or  historical  moment  one 
is  born  into.  It’s  nothing  but  an  accident  of  birth.  According  to  this  argument 
(now  a  creed),  history  teaches  that  religions,  tribes,  nations  and  ethnic  groups 
tend  to  disagree  about  fundamental  matters,  and  always  have.  Today,  the 
postmodernist  left  makes  the  additional  claim  that  one  group’s  morality  is 
nothing  but  its  attempt  to  exercise  power  over  another  group.  So,  the  decent 
thing  to  do — once  it  becomes  apparent  how  arbitrary  your,  and  your  society’s, 
“moral  values”  are — is  to  show  tolerance  for  people  who  think  differently,  and 
who  come  from  different  (diverse)  backgrounds.  That  emphasis  on  tolerance  is 
so  paramount  that  for  many  people  one  of  the  worst  character  flaws  a  person  can 
have  is  to  be  “judgmental.” fnl  And,  since  we  don’t  know  right  from  wrong,  or 
what  is  good,  just  about  the  most  inappropriate  thing  an  adult  can  do  is  give  a 
young  person  advice  about  how  to  live. 

And  so  a  generation  has  been  raised  untutored  in  what  was  once  called,  aptly, 
“practical  wisdom,”  which  guided  previous  generations.  Millennials,  often  told 
they  have  received  the  finest  education  available  anywhere,  have  actually 
suffered  a  form  of  serious  intellectual  and  moral  neglect.  The  relativists  of  my 
generation  and  Jordan’s,  many  of  whom  became  their  professors,  chose  to 
devalue  thousands  of  years  of  human  knowledge  about  how  to  acquire  virtue, 
dismissing  it  as  passe,  “not  relevant”  or  even  “oppressive.”  They  were  so 
successful  at  it  that  the  very  word  “virtue”  sounds  out  of  date,  and  someone 
using  it  appears  anachronistically  moralistic  and  self-righteous. 

The  study  of  virtue  is  not  quite  the  same  as  the  study  of  morals  (right  and 
wrong,  good  and  evil).  Aristotle  defined  the  virtues  simply  as  the  ways  of 


behaving  that  are  most  conducive  to  happiness  in  life.  Vice  was  defined  as  the 
ways  of  behaving  least  conducive  to  happiness.  He  observed  that  the  virtues 
always  aim  for  balance  and  avoid  the  extremes  of  the  vices.  Aristotle  studied  the 
virtues  and  the  vices  in  his  Nicomachean  Ethics.  It  was  a  book  based  on 
experience  and  observation,  not  conjecture,  about  the  kind  of  happiness  that  was 
possible  for  human  beings.  Cultivating  judgment  about  the  difference  between 
virtue  and  vice  is  the  beginning  of  wisdom,  something  that  can  never  be  out  of 
date. 

By  contrast,  our  modern  relativism  begins  by  asserting  that  making  judgments 
about  how  to  live  is  impossible,  because  there  is  no  real  good,  and  no  true  virtue 
(as  these  too  are  relative).  Thus  relativism’s  closest  approximation  to  “virtue”  is 
“tolerance.”  Only  tolerance  will  provide  social  cohesion  between  different 
groups,  and  save  us  from  harming  each  other.  On  Facebook  and  other  forms  of 
social  media,  therefore,  you  signal  your  so-called  virtue,  telling  everyone  how 
tolerant,  open  and  compassionate  you  are,  and  wait  for  likes  to  accumulate. 
(Leave  aside  that  telling  people  you’re  virtuous  isn’t  a  virtue,  it’s  self-promotion. 
Virtue  signalling  is  not  virtue.  Virtue  signalling  is,  quite  possibly,  our 
commonest  vice.) 

Intolerance  of  others’  views  (no  matter  how  ignorant  or  incoherent  they  may 
be)  is  not  simply  wrong;  in  a  world  where  there  is  no  right  or  wrong,  it  is  worse: 
it  is  a  sign  you  are  embarrassingly  unsophisticated  or,  possibly,  dangerous. 

But  it  turns  out  that  many  people  cannot  tolerate  the  vacuum — the  chaos — 
which  is  inherent  in  life,  but  made  worse  by  this  moral  relativism;  they  cannot 
live  without  a  moral  compass,  without  an  ideal  at  which  to  aim  in  their  lives. 

(For  relativists,  ideals  are  values  too,  and  like  all  values,  they  are  merely 
“relative”  and  hardly  worth  sacrificing  for.)  So,  right  alongside  relativism,  we 
find  the  spread  of  nihilism  and  despair,  and  also  the  opposite  of  moral  relativism: 
the  blind  certainty  offered  by  ideologies  that  claim  to  have  an  answer  for 
everything. 

And  so  we  arrive  at  the  second  teaching  that  millennials  have  been  bombarded 
with.  They  sign  up  for  a  humanities  course,  to  study  greatest  books  ever  written. 
But  they’re  not  assigned  the  books;  instead  they  are  given  ideological  attacks  on 
them,  based  on  some  appalling  simplification.  Where  the  relativist  is  filled  with 
uncertainty,  the  ideologue  is  the  very  opposite.  He  or  she  is  hyper-judgmental 
and  censorious,  always  knows  what’s  wrong  about  others,  and  what  to  do  about 
it.  Sometimes  it  seems  the  only  people  willing  to  give  advice  in  a  relativistic 
society  are  those  with  the  least  to  offer. 


Modern  moral  relativism  has  many  sources.  As  we  in  the  West  learned  more 
history,  we  understood  that  different  epochs  had  different  moral  codes.  As  we 
travelled  the  seas  and  explored  the  globe,  we  learned  of  far-flung  tribes  on 
different  continents  whose  different  moral  codes  made  sense  relative  to,  or 
within  the  framework  of,  their  societies.  Science  played  a  role,  too,  by  attacking 
the  religious  view  of  the  world,  and  thus  undermining  the  religious  grounds  for 
ethics  and  rules.  Materialist  social  science  implied  that  we  could  divide  the 
world  into  facts  (which  all  could  observe,  and  were  objective  and  “real”)  and 
values  (which  were  subjective  and  personal).  Then  we  could  first  agree  on  the 
facts,  and,  maybe,  one  day,  develop  a  scientific  code  of  ethics  (which  has  yet  to 
arrive).  Moreover,  by  implying  that  values  had  a  lesser  reality  than  facts,  science 
contributed  in  yet  another  way  to  moral  relativism,  for  it  treated  “value”  as 
secondary.  (But  the  idea  that  we  can  easily  separate  facts  and  values  was  and 
remains  naive;  to  some  extent,  one’s  values  determine  what  one  will  pay 
attention  to,  and  what  will  count  as  a  fact.) 

The  idea  that  different  societies  had  different  rules  and  morals  was  known  to 
the  ancient  world  too,  and  it  is  interesting  to  compare  its  response  to  this 
realization  with  the  modern  response  (relativism,  nihilism  and  ideology).  When 
the  ancient  Greeks  sailed  to  India  and  elsewhere,  they  too  discovered  that  rules, 
morals  and  customs  differed  from  place  to  place,  and  saw  that  the  explanation 
for  what  was  right  and  wrong  was  often  rooted  in  some  ancestral  authority.  The 
Greek  response  was  not  despair,  but  a  new  invention:  philosophy. 

Socrates,  reacting  to  the  uncertainty  bred  by  awareness  of  these  conflicting 
moral  codes,  decided  that  instead  of  becoming  a  nihilist,  a  relativist  or  an 
ideologue,  he  would  devote  his  life  to  the  search  for  wisdom  that  could  reason 
about  these  differences,  i.e.,  he  helped  invent  philosophy.  He  spent  his  life 
asking  perplexing,  foundational  questions,  such  as  “What  is  virtue?”  and  “How 
can  one  live  the  good  life?”  and  “What  is  justice?”  and  he  looked  at  different 
approaches,  asking  which  seemed  most  coherent  and  most  in  accord  with  human 
nature.  These  are  the  kinds  of  questions  that  I  believe  animate  this  book. 

For  the  ancients,  the  discovery  that  different  people  have  different  ideas  about 
how,  practically,  to  live,  did  not  paralyze  them;  it  deepened  their  understanding 
of  humanity  and  led  to  some  of  the  most  satisfying  conversations  human  beings 
have  ever  had,  about  how  life  might  be  lived. 

Likewise,  Aristotle.  Instead  of  despairing  about  these  differences  in  moral 
codes,  Aristotle  argued  that  though  specific  rules,  laws  and  customs  differed 
from  place  to  place,  what  does  not  differ  is  that  in  all  places  human  beings,  by 
their  nature,  have  a  proclivity  to  make  rules,  laws  and  customs.  To  put  this  in 
modern  terms,  it  seems  that  all  human  beings  are,  by  some  kind  of  biological 


endowment,  so  ineradicably  concerned  with  morality  that  we  create  a  structure 
of  laws  and  rules  wherever  we  are.  The  idea  that  human  life  can  be  free  of  moral 
concerns  is  a  fantasy. 

We  are  rule  generators.  And  given  that  we  are  moral  animals,  what  must  be 
the  effect  of  our  simplistic  modern  relativism  upon  us?  It  means  we  are  hobbling 
ourselves  by  pretending  to  be  something  we  are  not.  It  is  a  mask,  but  a  strange 
one,  for  it  mostly  deceives  the  one  who  wears  it.  Scccccratccch  the  most  clever 
postmodern-relativist  professor’s  Mercedes  with  a  key,  and  you  will  see  how  fast 
the  mask  of  relativism  (with  its  pretense  that  there  can  be  neither  right  nor 
wrong)  and  the  cloak  of  radical  tolerance  come  off. 

Because  we  do  not  yet  have  an  ethics  based  on  modern  science,  Jordan  is  not 
trying  to  develop  his  rules  by  wiping  the  slate  clean — by  dismissing  thousands  of 
years  of  wisdom  as  mere  superstition  and  ignoring  our  greatest  moral 
achievements.  Far  better  to  integrate  the  best  of  what  we  are  now  learning  with 
the  books  human  beings  saw  fit  to  preserve  over  millennia,  and  with  the  stories 
that  have  survived,  against  all  odds,  time’s  tendency  to  obliterate. 

He  is  doing  what  reasonable  guides  have  always  done:  he  makes  no  claim  that 
human  wisdom  begins  with  himself,  but,  rather,  turns  first  to  his  own  guides. 

And  although  the  topics  in  this  book  are  serious,  Jordan  often  has  great  fun 
addressing  them  with  a  light  touch,  as  the  chapter  headings  convey.  He  makes  no 
claim  to  be  exhaustive,  and  sometimes  the  chapters  consist  of  wide-ranging 
discussions  of  our  psychology  as  he  understands  it. 

So  why  not  call  this  a  book  of  “guidelines,”  a  far  more  relaxed,  user-friendly 
and  less  rigid  sounding  term  than  “rules”? 

Because  these  really  are  rules.  And  the  foremost  rule  is  that  you  must  take 
responsibility  for  your  own  life.  Period. 

One  might  think  that  a  generation  that  has  heard  endlessly,  from  their  more 
ideological  teachers,  about  the  rights,  rights,  rights  that  belong  to  them,  would 
object  to  being  told  that  they  would  do  better  to  focus  instead  on  taking 
responsibility.  Yet  this  generation,  many  of  whom  were  raised  in  small  families 
by  hyper-protective  parents,  on  soft-surface  playgrounds,  and  then  taught  in 
universities  with  “safe  spaces”  where  they  don’t  have  to  hear  things  they  don’t 
want  to — schooled  to  be  risk-averse — has  among  it,  now,  millions  who  feel 
stultified  by  this  underestimation  of  their  potential  resilience  and  who  have 
embraced  Jordan’s  message  that  each  individual  has  ultimate  responsibility  to 
bear;  that  if  one  wants  to  live  a  full  life,  one  first  sets  one’s  own  house  in  order; 
and  only  then  can  one  sensibly  aim  to  take  on  bigger  responsibilities.  The  extent 
of  this  reaction  has  often  moved  both  of  us  to  the  brink  of  tears. 


Sometimes  these  rules  are  demanding.  They  require  you  to  undertake  an 
incremental  process  that  over  time  will  stretch  you  to  a  new  limit.  That  requires, 
as  I’ve  said,  venturing  into  the  unknown.  Stretching  yourself  beyond  the 
boundaries  of  your  current  self  requires  carefully  choosing  and  then  pursuing 
ideals:  ideals  that  are  up  there,  above  you,  superior  to  you — and  that  you  can’t 
always  be  sure  you  will  reach. 

But  if  it’s  uncertain  that  our  ideals  are  attainable,  why  do  we  bother  reaching 
in  the  first  place?  Because  if  you  don’t  reach  for  them,  it  is  certain  you  will  never 
feel  that  your  life  has  meaning. 

And  perhaps  because,  as  unfamiliar  and  strange  as  it  sounds,  in  the  deepest 
part  of  our  psyche,  we  all  want  to  be  judged.

Overture 


This  book  has  a  short  history  and  a  long  history.  We’ll  begin  with  the  short 
history. 

In  2012, 1  started  contributing  to  a  website  called  Quora.  On  Quora,  anyone 
can  ask  a  question,  of  any  sort — and  anyone  can  answer.  Readers  upvote  those 
answers  they  like,  and  downvote  those  they  don’t.  In  this  manner,  the  most 
useful  answers  rise  to  the  top,  while  the  others  sink  into  oblivion.  I  was  curious 
about  the  site.  I  liked  its  free-for-all  nature.  The  discussion  was  often 
compelling,  and  it  was  interesting  to  see  the  diverse  range  of  opinions  generated 
by  the  same  question. 

When  I  was  taking  a  break  (or  avoiding  work),  I  often  turned  to  Quora, 
looking  for  questions  to  engage  with.  I  considered,  and  eventually  answered, 
such  questions  as  “What’s  the  difference  between  being  happy  and  being 
content?”,  “What  things  get  better  as  you  age?”  and  “What  makes  life  more 
meaningful?” 

Quora  tells  you  how  many  people  have  viewed  your  answer  and  how  many 
upvotes  you  received.  Thus,  you  can  determine  your  reach,  and  see  what  people 
think  of  your  ideas.  Only  a  small  minority  of  those  who  view  an  answer  upvote 
it.  As  of  July  2017,  as  I  write  this — and  five  years  after  I  addressed  “What  makes 
life  more  meaningful?” — my  answer  to  that  question  has  received  a  relatively 
small  audience  (14,000  views,  and  133  upvotes),  while  my  response  to  the 
question  about  aging  has  been  viewed  by  7,200  people  and  received  36  upvotes. 
Not  exactly  home  runs.  However,  it’s  to  be  expected.  On  such  sites,  most 
answers  receive  very  little  attention,  while  a  tiny  minority  become 
disproportionately  popular. 

Soon  after,  I  answered  another  question:  “What  are  the  most  valuable  things 
everyone  should  know?”  I  wrote  a  list  of  rules,  or  maxims;  some  dead  serious, 
some  tongue-in-cheek — “Be  grateful  in  spite  of  your  suffering,”  “Do  not  do 
things  that  you  hate,”  “Do  not  hide  things  in  the  fog,”  and  so  on.  The  Quora 
readers  appeared  pleased  with  this  list.  They  commented  on  and  shared  it.  They 
said  such  things  as  “I’m  definitely  printing  this  list  out  and  keeping  it  as  a 
reference.  Simply  phenomenal,”  and  “You  win  Quora.  We  can  just  close  the  site 


now.”  Students  at  the  University  of  Toronto,  where  I  teach,  came  up  to  me  and 
told  me  how  much  they  liked  it.  To  date,  my  answer  to  “What  are  the  most 
valuable  things  ...”  has  been  viewed  by  a  hundred  and  twenty  thousand  people 
and  been  upvoted  twenty-three  hundred  times.  Only  a  few  hundred  of  the 
roughly  six  hundred  thousand  questions  on  Quora  have  cracked  the  two- 
thousand-upvote  barrier.  My  procrastination-induced  musings  hit  a  nerve.  I  had 
written  a  99.9  percentile  answer. 

It  was  not  obvious  to  me  when  I  wrote  the  list  of  rules  for  living  that  it  was 
going  to  perform  so  well.  I  had  put  a  fair  bit  of  care  into  all  the  sixty  or  so 
answers  I  submitted  in  the  few  months  surrounding  that  post.  Nonetheless, 

Quora  provides  market  research  at  its  finest.  The  respondents  are  anonymous. 
They’re  disinterested,  in  the  best  sense.  Their  opinions  are  spontaneous  and 
unbiased.  So,  I  paid  attention  to  the  results,  and  thought  about  the  reasons  for 
that  answer’s  disproportionate  success.  Perhaps  I  struck  the  right  balance 
between  the  familiar  and  the  unfamiliar  while  formulating  the  rules.  Perhaps 
people  were  drawn  to  the  structure  that  such  rules  imply.  Perhaps  people  just  like 
lists. 

A  few  months  earlier,  in  March  of  2012, 1  had  received  an  email  from  a 
literary  agent.  She  had  heard  me  speak  on  CBC  radio  during  a  show  entitled  Just 
Say  No  to  Happiness,  where  I  had  criticized  the  idea  that  happiness  was  the 
proper  goal  for  life.  Over  the  previous  decades  I  had  read  more  than  my  share  of 
dark  books  about  the  twentieth  century,  focusing  particularly  on  Nazi  Germany 
and  the  Soviet  Union.  Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn,  the  great  documenter  of  the 
slave-labour-camp  horrors  of  the  latter,  once  wrote  that  the  “pitiful  ideology” 
holding  that  “human  beings  are  created  for  happiness”  was  an  ideology  “done  in 
by  the  first  blow  of  the  work  assigner’s  cudgel.”  In  a  crisis,  the  inevitable 
suffering  that  life  entails  can  rapidly  make  a  mockery  of  the  idea  that  happiness 
is  the  proper  pursuit  of  the  individual.  On  the  radio  show,  I  suggested,  instead, 
that  a  deeper  meaning  was  required.  I  noted  that  the  nature  of  such  meaning  was 
constantly  re-presented  in  the  great  stories  of  the  past,  and  that  it  had  more  to  do 
with  developing  character  in  the  face  of  suffering  than  with  happiness.  This  is 
part  of  the  long  history  of  the  present  work. 

From  1985  until  1999  I  worked  for  about  three  hours  a  day  on  the  only  other 
book  I  have  ever  published:  Maps  of  Meaning:  The  Architecture  of  Belief. 

During  that  time,  and  in  the  years  since,  I  also  taught  a  course  on  the  material  in 
that  book,  first  at  Harvard,  and  now  at  the  University  of  Toronto.  In  2013, 
observing  the  rise  of  YouTube,  and  because  of  the  popularity  of  some  work  I  had 
done  with  TVO,  a  Canadian  public  TV  station,  I  decided  to  film  my  university 
and  public  lectures  and  place  them  online.  They  attracted  an  increasingly  large 


audience — more  than  a  million  views  by  April  2016.  The  number  of  views  has 
risen  very  dramatically  since  then  (up  to  eighteen  million  as  I  write  this),  but  that 
is  in  part  because  I  became  embroiled  in  a  political  controversy  that  drew  an 
inordinate  amount  of  attention. 

That’s  another  story.  Maybe  even  another  book. 

I  proposed  in  Maps  of  Meaning  that  the  great  myths  and  religious  stories  of 
the  past,  particularly  those  derived  from  an  earlier,  oral  tradition,  were  moral  in 
their  intent,  rather  than  descriptive.  Thus,  they  did  not  concern  themselves  with 
what  the  world  was,  as  a  scientist  might  have  it,  but  with  how  a  human  being 
should  act.  I  suggested  that  our  ancestors  portrayed  the  world  as  a  stage — a 
drama — instead  of  a  place  of  objects.  I  described  how  I  had  come  to  believe  that 
the  constituent  elements  of  the  world  as  drama  were  order  and  chaos,  and  not 
material  things. 

Order  is  where  the  people  around  you  act  according  to  well-understood  social 
norms,  and  remain  predictable  and  cooperative.  It’s  the  world  of  social  structure, 
explored  territory,  and  familiarity.  The  state  of  Order  is  typically  portrayed, 
symbolically — imaginatively — as  masculine.  It’s  the  Wise  King  and  the  Tyrant, 
forever  bound  together,  as  society  is  simultaneously  structure  and  oppression. 

Chaos,  by  contrast,  is  where — or  when — something  unexpected  happens. 
Chaos  emerges,  in  trivial  form,  when  you  tell  a  joke  at  a  party  with  people  you 
think  you  know  and  a  silent  and  embarrassing  chill  falls  over  the  gathering. 
Chaos  is  what  emerges  more  catastrophically  when  you  suddenly  find  yourself 
without  employment,  or  are  betrayed  by  a  lover.  As  the  antithesis  of 
symbolically  masculine  order,  it’s  presented  imaginatively  as  feminine.  It’s  the 
new  and  unpredictable  suddenly  emerging  in  the  midst  of  the  commonplace 
familiar.  It’s  Creation  and  Destruction,  the  source  of  new  things  and  the 
destination  of  the  dead  (as  nature,  as  opposed  to  culture,  is  simultaneously  birth 
and  demise). 

Order  and  chaos  are  the  yang  and  yin  of  the  famous  Taoist  symbol:  two 
serpents,  head  to  tail. fnl  Order  is  the  white,  masculine  serpent;  Chaos,  its  black, 
feminine  counterpart.  The  black  dot  in  the  white — and  the  white  in  the  black — 
indicate  the  possibility  of  transformation:  just  when  things  seem  secure,  the 
unknown  can  loom,  unexpectedly  and  large.  Conversely,  just  when  everything 
seems  lost,  new  order  can  emerge  from  catastrophe  and  chaos. 

For  the  Taoists,  meaning  is  to  be  found  on  the  border  between  the  ever- 
entwined  pair.  To  walk  that  border  is  to  stay  on  the  path  of  life,  the  divine  Way. 

And  that’s  much  better  than  happiness. 

The  literary  agent  I  referred  to  listened  to  the  CBC  radio  broadcast  where  I 
discussed  such  issues.  It  left  her  asking  herself  deeper  questions.  She  emailed 


me,  asking  if  I  had  considered  writing  a  book  for  a  general  audience.  I  had 
previously  attempted  to  produce  a  more  accessible  version  of  Maps  of  Meaning, 
which  is  a  very  dense  book.  But  I  found  that  the  spirit  was  neither  in  me  during 
that  attempt  nor  in  the  resultant  manuscript.  I  think  this  was  because  I  was 
imitating  my  former  self,  and  my  previous  book,  instead  of  occupying  the  place 
between  order  and  chaos  and  producing  something  new.  I  suggested  that  she 
watch  four  of  the  lectures  I  had  done  for  a  TVO  program  called  Big  Ideas  on  my 
YouTube  channel.  I  thought  if  she  did  that  we  could  have  a  more  informed  and 
thorough  discussion  about  what  kind  of  topics  I  might  address  in  a  more  publicly 
accessible  book. 

She  contacted  me  a  few  weeks  later,  after  watching  all  four  lectures  and 
discussing  them  with  a  colleague.  Her  interest  had  been  further  heightened,  as 
had  her  commitment  to  the  project.  That  was  promising — and  unexpected.  I’m 
always  surprised  when  people  respond  positively  to  what  I  am  saying,  given  its 
seriousness  and  strange  nature.  I’m  amazed  I  have  been  allowed  (even 
encouraged)  to  teach  what  I  taught  first  in  Boston  and  now  in  Toronto.  I’ve 
always  thought  that  if  people  really  noticed  what  I  was  teaching  there  would  be 
Hell  to  pay.  You  can  decide  for  yourself  what  truth  there  might  be  in  that  concern 
after  reading  this  book.  :) 

She  suggested  that  I  write  a  guide  of  sorts  to  what  a  person  needs  “to  live 
well” — whatever  that  might  mean.  I  thought  immediately  about  my  Quora  list.  I 
had  in  the  meantime  written  some  further  thoughts  about  of  the  rules  I  had 
posted.  People  had  responded  positively  toward  those  new  ideas,  as  well.  It 
seemed  to  me,  therefore,  that  there  might  be  a  nice  fit  between  the  Quora  list  and 
my  new  agent’s  ideas.  So,  I  sent  her  the  list.  She  liked  it. 

At  about  the  same  time,  a  friend  and  former  student  of  mine — the  novelist  and 
screenwriter  Gregg  Hurwitz — was  considering  a  new  book,  which  would 
become  the  bestselling  thriller  Orphan  X.  He  liked  the  rules,  too.  He  had  Mia, 
the  book’s  female  lead,  post  a  selection  of  them,  one  by  one,  on  her  fridge,  at 
points  in  the  story  where  they  seemed  apropos.  That  was  another  piece  of 
evidence  supporting  my  supposition  of  their  attractiveness.  I  suggested  to  my 
agent  that  I  write  a  brief  chapter  on  each  of  the  rules.  She  agreed,  so  I  wrote  a 
book  proposal  suggesting  as  much.  When  I  started  writing  the  actual  chapters, 
however,  they  weren’t  at  all  brief.  I  had  much  more  to  say  about  each  rule  than  I 
originally  envisioned. 

This  was  partly  because  I  had  spent  a  very  long  time  researching  my  first 
book:  studying  history,  mythology,  neuroscience,  psychoanalysis,  child 
psychology,  poetry,  and  large  sections  of  the  Bible.  I  read  and  perhaps  even 
understood  much  of  Milton’s  Paradise  Lost,  Goethe’s  Faust  and  Dante’s  Inferno. 


I  integrated  all  of  that,  for  better  or  worse,  trying  to  address  a  perplexing 
problem:  the  reason  or  reasons  for  the  nuclear  standoff  of  the  Cold  War.  I 
couldn’t  understand  how  belief  systems  could  be  so  important  to  people  that  they 
were  willing  to  risk  the  destruction  of  the  world  to  protect  them.  I  came  to 
realize  that  shared  belief  systems  made  people  intelligible  to  one  another — and 
that  the  systems  weren’t  just  about  belief. 

People  who  live  by  the  same  code  are  rendered  mutually  predictable  to  one 
another.  They  act  in  keeping  with  each  other’s  expectations  and  desires.  They 
can  cooperate.  They  can  even  compete  peacefully,  because  everyone  knows  what 
to  expect  from  everyone  else.  A  shared  belief  system,  partly  psychological, 
partly  acted  out,  simplifies  everyone — in  their  own  eyes,  and  in  the  eyes  of 
others.  Shared  beliefs  simplify  the  world,  as  well,  because  people  who  know 
what  to  expect  from  one  another  can  act  together  to  tame  the  world.  There  is 
perhaps  nothing  more  important  than  the  maintenance  of  this  organization — this 
simplification.  If  it’s  threatened,  the  great  ship  of  state  rocks. 

It  isn’t  precisely  that  people  will  fight  for  what  they  believe.  They  will  fight, 
instead,  to  maintain  the  match  between  what  they  believe,  what  they  expect,  and 
what  they  desire.  They  will  fight  to  maintain  the  match  between  what  they 
expect  and  how  everyone  is  acting.  It  is  precisely  the  maintenance  of  that  match 
that  enables  everyone  to  live  together  peacefully,  predictably  and  productively.  It 
reduces  uncertainty  and  the  chaotic  mix  of  intolerable  emotions  that  uncertainty 
inevitably  produces. 

Imagine  someone  betrayed  by  a  trusted  lover.  The  sacred  social  contract 
obtaining  between  the  two  has  been  violated.  Actions  speak  louder  than  words, 
and  an  act  of  betrayal  disrupts  the  fragile  and  carefully  negotiated  peace  of  an 
intimate  relationship.  In  the  aftermath  of  disloyalty,  people  are  seized  by  terrible 
emotions:  disgust,  contempt  (for  self  and  traitor),  guilt,  anxiety,  rage  and  dread. 
Conflict  is  inevitable,  sometimes  with  deadly  results.  Shared  belief  systems — 
shared  systems  of  agreed-upon  conduct  and  expectation — regulate  and  control 
all  those  powerful  forces.  It’s  no  wonder  that  people  will  fight  to  protect 
something  that  saves  them  from  being  possessed  by  emotions  of  chaos  and  terror 
(and  after  that  from  degeneration  into  strife  and  combat). 

There’s  more  to  it,  too.  A  shared  cultural  system  stabilizes  human  interaction, 
but  is  also  a  system  of  value — a  hierarchy  of  value,  where  some  things  are  given 
priority  and  importance  and  others  are  not.  In  the  absence  of  such  a  system  of 
value,  people  simply  cannot  act.  In  fact,  they  can’t  even  perceive,  because  both 
action  and  perception  require  a  goal,  and  a  valid  goal  is,  by  necessity,  something 
valued.  We  experience  much  of  our  positive  emotion  in  relation  to  goals.  We  are 
not  happy,  technically  speaking,  unless  we  see  ourselves  progressing — and  the 


very  idea  of  progression  implies  value.  Worse  yet  is  the  fact  that  the  meaning  of 
life  without  positive  value  is  not  simply  neutral.  Because  we  are  vulnerable  and 
mortal,  pain  and  anxiety  are  an  integral  part  of  human  existence.  We  must  have 
something  to  set  against  the  suffering  that  is  intrinsic  to  Being. fn2  We  must  have 
the  meaning  inherent  in  a  profound  system  of  value  or  the  horror  of  existence 
rapidly  becomes  paramount.  Then,  nihilism  beckons,  with  its  hopelessness  and 
despair. 

So:  no  value,  no  meaning.  Between  value  systems,  however,  there  is  the 
possibility  of  conflict.  We  are  thus  eternally  caught  between  the  most  diamantine 
rock  and  the  hardest  of  places:  loss  of  group-centred  belief  renders  life  chaotic, 
miserable,  intolerable;  presence  of  group-centred  belief  makes  conflict  with 
other  groups  inevitable.  In  the  West,  we  have  been  withdrawing  from  our 
tradition-,  religion-  and  even  nation-centred  cultures,  partly  to  decrease  the 
danger  of  group  conflict.  But  we  are  increasingly  falling  prey  to  the  desperation 
of  meaninglessness,  and  that  is  no  improvement  at  all. 

While  writing  Maps  of  Meaning,  I  was  (also)  driven  by  the  realization  that  we 
can  no  longer  afford  conflict — certainly  not  on  the  scale  of  the  world 
conflagrations  of  the  twentieth  century.  Our  technologies  of  destruction  have 
become  too  powerful.  The  potential  consequences  of  war  are  literally 
apocalyptic.  But  we  cannot  simply  abandon  our  systems  of  value,  our  beliefs, 
our  cultures,  either.  I  agonized  over  this  apparently  intractable  problem  for 
months.  Was  there  a  third  way,  invisible  to  me?  I  dreamt  one  night  during  this 
period  that  I  was  suspended  in  mid-air,  clinging  to  a  chandelier,  many  stories 
above  the  ground,  directly  under  the  dome  of  a  massive  cathedral.  The  people  on 
the  floor  below  were  distant  and  tiny.  There  was  a  great  expanse  between  me  and 
any  wall — and  even  the  peak  of  the  dome  itself. 

I  have  learned  to  pay  attention  to  dreams,  not  least  because  of  my  training  as  a 
clinical  psychologist.  Dreams  shed  light  on  the  dim  places  where  reason  itself 
has  yet  to  voyage.  I  have  studied  Christianity  a  fair  bit,  too  (more  than  other 
religious  traditions,  although  I  am  always  trying  to  redress  this  lack).  Like 
others,  therefore,  I  must  and  do  draw  more  from  what  I  do  know  than  from  what 
I  do  not.  I  knew  that  cathedrals  were  constructed  in  the  shape  of  a  cross,  and  that 
the  point  under  the  dome  was  the  centre  of  the  cross.  I  knew  that  the  cross  was 
simultaneously,  the  point  of  greatest  suffering,  the  point  of  death  and 
transformation,  and  the  symbolic  centre  of  the  world.  That  was  not  somewhere  I 
wanted  to  be.  I  managed  to  get  down,  out  of  the  heights — out  of  the  symbolic 
sky — back  to  safe,  familiar,  anonymous  ground.  I  don’t  know  how.  Then,  still  in 
my  dream,  I  returned  to  my  bedroom  and  my  bed  and  tried  to  return  to  sleep  and 
the  peace  of  unconsciousness.  As  I  relaxed,  however,  I  could  feel  my  body 


transported.  A  great  wind  was  dissolving  me,  preparing  to  propel  me  back  to  the 
cathedral,  to  place  me  once  again  at  that  central  point.  There  was  no  escape.  It 
was  a  true  nightmare.  I  forced  myself  awake.  The  curtains  behind  me  were 
blowing  in  over  my  pillows.  Half  asleep,  I  looked  at  the  foot  of  the  bed.  I  saw 
the  great  cathedral  doors.  I  shook  myself  completely  awake  and  they 
disappeared. 

My  dream  placed  me  at  the  centre  of  Being  itself,  and  there  was  no  escape.  It 
took  me  months  to  understand  what  this  meant.  During  this  time,  I  came  to  a 
more  complete,  personal  realization  of  what  the  great  stories  of  the  past 
continually  insist  upon:  the  centre  is  occupied  by  the  individual.  The  centre  is 
marked  by  the  cross,  as  X  marks  the  spot.  Existence  at  that  cross  is  suffering  and 
transformation — and  that  fact,  above  all,  needs  to  be  voluntarily  accepted.  It  is 
possible  to  transcend  slavish  adherence  to  the  group  and  its  doctrines  and, 
simultaneously,  to  avoid  the  pitfalls  of  its  opposite  extreme,  nihilism.  It  is 
possible,  instead,  to  find  sufficient  meaning  in  individual  consciousness  and 
experience. 

How  could  the  world  be  freed  from  the  terrible  dilemma  of  conflict,  on  the 
one  hand,  and  psychological  and  social  dissolution,  on  the  other?  The  answer 
was  this:  through  the  elevation  and  development  of  the  individual,  and  through 
the  willingness  of  everyone  to  shoulder  the  burden  of  Being  and  to  take  the 
heroic  path.  We  must  each  adopt  as  much  responsibility  as  possible  for 
individual  life,  society  and  the  world.  We  must  each  tell  the  truth  and  repair  what 
is  in  disrepair  and  break  down  and  recreate  what  is  old  and  outdated.  It  is  in  this 
manner  that  we  can  and  must  reduce  the  suffering  that  poisons  the  world.  It’s 
asking  a  lot.  It’s  asking  for  everything.  But  the  alternative — the  horror  of 
authoritarian  belief,  the  chaos  of  the  collapsed  state,  the  tragic  catastrophe  of  the 
unbridled  natural  world,  the  existential  angst  and  weakness  of  the  purposeless 
individual — is  clearly  worse. 

I  have  been  thinking  and  lecturing  about  such  ideas  for  decades.  I  have  built 
up  a  large  corpus  of  stories  and  concepts  pertaining  to  them.  I  am  not  for  a 
moment  claiming,  however,  that  I  am  entirely  correct  or  complete  in  my 
thinking.  Being  is  far  more  complicated  than  one  person  can  know,  and  I  don’t 
have  the  whole  story.  I’m  simply  offering  the  best  I  can  manage. 

In  any  case,  the  consequence  of  all  that  previous  research  and  thinking  was  the 
new  essays  which  eventually  became  this  book.  My  initial  idea  was  to  write  a 
short  essay  on  all  forty  of  the  answers  I  had  provided  to  Quora.  That  proposal 
was  accepted  by  Penguin  Random  House  Canada.  While  writing,  however,  I  cut 
the  essay  number  to  twenty-five  and  then  to  sixteen  and  then  finally,  to  the 
current  twelve.  I’ve  been  editing  that  remainder,  with  the  help  and  care  of  my 


official  editor  (and  with  the  vicious  and  horribly  accurate  criticism  of  Hurwitz, 
mentioned  previously)  for  the  past  three  years. 

It  took  a  long  time  to  settle  on  a  title:  12  Rules  for  Life:  An  Antidote  to  Chaos. 
Why  did  that  one  rise  up  above  all  others?  First  and  foremost,  because  of  its 
simplicity.  It  indicates  clearly  that  people  need  ordering  principles,  and  that 
chaos  otherwise  beckons.  We  require  rules,  standards,  values — alone  and 
together.  We’re  pack  animals,  beasts  of  burden.  We  must  bear  a  load,  to  justify 
our  miserable  existence.  We  require  routine  and  tradition.  That’s  order.  Order 
can  become  excessive,  and  that’s  not  good,  but  chaos  can  swamp  us,  so  we 
drown — and  that  is  also  not  good.  We  need  to  stay  on  the  straight  and  narrow 
path.  Each  of  the  twelve  rules  of  this  book — and  their  accompanying  essays — 
therefore  provide  a  guide  to  being  there.  “There”  is  the  dividing  line  between 
order  and  chaos.  That’s  where  we  are  simultaneously  stable  enough,  exploring 
enough,  transforming  enough,  repairing  enough,  and  cooperating  enough.  It’s 
there  we  find  the  meaning  that  justifies  life  and  its  inevitable  suffering.  Perhaps, 
if  we  lived  properly,  we  would  be  able  to  tolerate  the  weight  of  our  own  self- 
consciousness.  Perhaps,  if  we  lived  properly,  we  could  withstand  the  knowledge 
of  our  own  fragility  and  mortality,  without  the  sense  of  aggrieved  victimhood 
that  produces,  first,  resentment,  then  envy,  and  then  the  desire  for  vengeance  and 
destruction.  Perhaps,  if  we  lived  properly,  we  wouldn’t  have  to  turn  to 
totalitarian  certainty  to  shield  ourselves  from  the  knowledge  of  our  own 
insufficiency  and  ignorance.  Perhaps  we  could  come  to  avoid  those  pathways  to 
Hell — and  we  have  seen  in  the  terrible  twentieth  century  just  how  real  Hell  can 
be. 

I  hope  that  these  rules  and  their  accompanying  essays  will  help  people 
understand  what  they  already  know:  that  the  soul  of  the  individual  eternally 
hungers  for  the  heroism  of  genuine  Being,  and  that  the  willingness  to  take  on 
that  responsibility  is  identical  to  the  decision  to  live  a  meaningful  life. 

If  we  each  live  properly,  we  will  collectively  flourish. 

Best  wishes  to  you  all,  as  you  proceed  through  these  pages.

RULE  1 


STAND  UP  STRAIGHT  WITH  YOUR  SHOULDERS  BACK 

LOBSTERS— AND  TERRITORY 

If  you  are  like  most  people,  you  don’t  often  think  about  lobsters  — unless  you’re 
eating  one.  However,  these  interesting  and  delicious  crustaceans  are  very  much 
worth  considering.  Their  nervous  systems  are  comparatively  simple,  with  large, 
easily  observable  neurons,  the  magic  cells  of  the  brain.  Because  of  this,  scientists 
have  been  able  to  map  the  neural  circuitry  of  lobsters  very  accurately.  This  has 
helped  us  understand  the  structure  and  function  of  the  brain  and  behaviour  of 
more  complex  animals,  including  human  beings.  Lobsters  have  more  in  common 
with  you  than  you  might  think  (particularly  when  you  are  feeling  crabby — ha 
ha). 

Lobsters  live  on  the  ocean  floor.  They  need  a  home  base  down  there,  a  range 
within  which  they  hunt  for  prey  and  scavenge  around  for  stray  edible  bits  and 
pieces  of  whatever  rains  down  from  the  continual  chaos  of  carnage  and  death  far 
above.  They  want  somewhere  secure,  where  the  hunting  and  the  gathering  is 
good.  They  want  a  home. 

This  can  present  a  problem,  since  there  are  many  lobsters.  What  if  two  of 
them  occupy  the  same  territory,  at  the  bottom  of  the  ocean,  at  the  same  time,  and 
both  want  to  live  there?  What  if  there  are  hundreds  of  lobsters,  all  trying  to  make 
a  living  and  raise  a  family,  in  the  same  crowded  patch  of  sand  and  refuse? 

Other  creatures  have  this  problem,  too.  When  songbirds  come  north  in  the 
spring,  for  example,  they  engage  in  ferocious  territorial  disputes.  The  songs  they 
sing,  so  peaceful  and  beautiful  to  human  ears,  are  siren  calls  and  cries  of 
domination.  A  brilliantly  musical  bird  is  a  small  warrior  proclaiming  his 
sovereignty.  Take  the  wren,  for  example,  a  small,  feisty,  insect-eating  songbird 
common  in  North  America.  A  newly  arrived  wren  wants  a  sheltered  place  to 
build  a  nest,  away  from  the  wind  and  rain.  He  wants  it  close  to  food,  and 
attractive  to  potential  mates.  He  also  wants  to  convince  competitors  for  that 
space  to  keep  their  distance. 

Birds — and  Territory 

My  dad  and  I  designed  a  house  for  a  wren  family  when  I  was  ten  years  old.  It 
looked  like  a  Conestoga  wagon,  and  had  a  front  entrance  about  the  size  of  a 


quarter.  This  made  it  a  good  house  for  wrens,  who  are  tiny,  and  not  so  good  for 
other,  larger  birds,  who  couldn’t  get  in.  My  elderly  neighbour  had  a  birdhouse, 
too,  which  we  built  for  her  at  the  same  time,  from  an  old  rubber  boot.  It  had  an 
opening  large  enough  for  a  bird  the  size  of  a  robin.  She  was  looking  forward  to 
the  day  it  was  occupied. 

A  wren  soon  discovered  our  birdhouse,  and  made  himself  at  home  there.  We 
could  hear  his  lengthy,  trilling  song,  repeated  over  and  over,  during  the  early 
spring.  Once  he’d  built  his  nest  in  the  covered  wagon,  however,  our  new  avian 
tenant  started  carrying  small  sticks  to  our  neighbour’s  nearby  boot.  He  packed  it 
so  full  that  no  other  bird,  large  or  small,  could  possibly  get  in.  Our  neighbour 
was  not  pleased  by  this  pre-emptive  strike,  but  there  was  nothing  to  be  done 
about  it.  “If  we  take  it  down,”  said  my  dad,  “clean  it  up,  and  put  it  back  in  the 
tree,  the  wren  will  just  pack  it  full  of  sticks  again.”  Wrens  are  small,  and  they’re 
cute,  but  they’re  merciless. 

I  had  broken  my  leg  skiing  the  previous  winter — first  time  down  the  hill — and 
had  received  some  money  from  a  school  insurance  policy  designed  to  reward 
unfortunate,  clumsy  children.  I  purchased  a  cassette  recorder  (a  high-tech 
novelty  at  the  time)  with  the  proceeds.  My  dad  suggested  that  I  sit  on  the  back 
lawn,  record  the  wren’s  song,  play  it  back,  and  watch  what  happened.  So,  I  went 
out  into  the  bright  spring  sunlight  and  taped  a  few  minutes  of  the  wren  laying 
furious  claim  to  his  territory  with  song.  Then  I  let  him  hear  his  own  voice.  That 
little  bird,  one-third  the  size  of  a  sparrow,  began  to  dive-bomb  me  and  my 
cassette  recorder,  swooping  back  and  forth,  inches  from  the  speaker.  We  saw  a 
lot  of  that  sort  of  behaviour,  even  in  the  absence  of  the  tape  recorder.  If  a  larger 
bird  ever  dared  to  sit  and  rest  in  any  of  the  trees  near  our  birdhouse  there  was  a 
good  chance  he  would  get  knocked  off  his  perch  by  a  kamikaze  wren. 

Now,  wrens  and  lobsters  are  very  different.  Lobsters  do  not  fly,  sing  or  perch 
in  trees.  Wrens  have  feathers,  not  hard  shells.  Wrens  can’t  breathe  underwater, 
and  are  seldom  served  with  butter.  However,  they  are  also  similar  in  important 
ways.  Both  are  obsessed  with  status  and  position,  for  example,  like  a  great  many 
creatures.  The  Norwegian  zoologist  and  comparative  psychologist  Thorlief 
Schjelderup-Ebbe  observed  (back  in  1921)  that  even  common  barnyard  chickens 
establish  a  “pecking  order.” 

The  determination  of  Who’s  Who  in  the  chicken  world  has  important 
implications  for  each  individual  bird’s  survival,  particularly  in  times  of  scarcity. 
The  birds  that  always  have  priority  access  to  whatever  food  is  sprinkled  out  in 
the  yard  in  the  morning  are  the  celebrity  chickens.  After  them  come  the  second- 
stringers,  the  hangers-on  and  wannabes.  Then  the  third-rate  chickens  have  their 


turn,  and  so  on,  down  to  the  bedraggled,  partially-feathered  and  badly-pecked 
wretches  who  occupy  the  lowest,  untouchable  stratum  of  the  chicken  hierarchy. 

Chickens,  like  suburbanites,  live  communally.  Songbirds,  such  as  wrens,  do 
not,  but  they  still  inhabit  a  dominance  hierarchy.  It’s  just  spread  out  over  more 
territory.  The  wiliest,  strongest,  healthiest  and  most  fortunate  birds  occupy  prime 
territory,  and  defend  it.  Because  of  this,  they  are  more  likely  to  attract  high- 
quality  mates,  and  to  hatch  chicks  who  survive  and  thrive.  Protection  from  wind, 
rain  and  predators,  as  well  as  easy  access  to  superior  food,  makes  for  a  much  less 
stressed  existence.  Territory  matters,  and  there  is  little  difference  between 
territorial  rights  and  social  status.  It  is  often  a  matter  of  life  and  death. 

If  a  contagious  avian  disease  sweeps  through  a  neighbourhood  of  well- 
stratified  songbirds,  it  is  the  least  dominant  and  most  stressed  birds,  occupying 
the  lowest  rungs  of  the  bird  world,  who  are  most  likely  to  sicken  and  die.  This 
is  equally  true  of  human  neighbourhoods,  when  bird  flu  viruses  and  other 
illnesses  sweep  across  the  planet.  The  poor  and  stressed  always  die  first,  and  in 
greater  numbers.  They  are  also  much  more  susceptible  to  non-inf ectious 
diseases,  such  as  cancer,  diabetes  and  heart  disease.  When  the  aristocracy 
catches  a  cold,  as  it  is  said,  the  working  class  dies  of  pneumonia. 

Because  territory  matters,  and  because  the  best  locales  are  always  in  short 
supply,  territory-seeking  among  animals  produces  conflict.  Conflict,  in  turn, 
produces  another  problem:  how  to  win  or  lose  without  the  disagreeing  parties 
incurring  too  great  a  cost.  This  latter  point  is  particularly  important.  Imagine  that 
two  birds  engage  in  a  squabble  about  a  desirable  nesting  area.  The  interaction 
can  easily  degenerate  into  outright  physical  combat.  Under  such  circumstances, 
one  bird,  usually  the  largest,  will  eventually  win — but  even  the  victor  may  be 
hurt  by  the  fight.  That  means  a  third  bird,  an  undamaged,  canny  bystander,  can 
move  in,  opportunistically,  and  defeat  the  now-crippled  victor.  That  is  not  at  all  a 
good  deal  for  the  first  two  birds. 

Conflict — and  Territory 

Over  the  millennia,  animals  who  must  co-habit  with  others  in  the  same  territories 
have  in  consequence  learned  many  tricks  to  establish  dominance,  while  risking 
the  least  amount  of  possible  damage.  A  defeated  wolf,  for  example,  will  roll  over 
on  its  back,  exposing  its  throat  to  the  victor,  who  will  not  then  deign  to  tear  it 
out.  The  now-dominant  wolf  may  still  require  a  future  hunting  partner,  after  all, 
even  one  as  pathetic  as  his  now-defeated  foe.  Bearded  dragons,  remarkable 
social  lizards,  wave  their  front  legs  peaceably  at  one  another  to  indicate  their 
wish  for  continued  social  harmony.  Dolphins  produce  specialized  sound  pulses 


while  hunting  and  during  other  times  of  high  excitement  to  reduce  potential 
conflict  among  dominant  and  subordinate  group  members.  Such  behavior  is 
endemic  in  the  community  of  living  things. 

Lobsters,  scuttling  around  on  the  ocean  floor,  are  no  exception.-  If  you  catch  a 
few  dozen,  and  transport  them  to  a  new  location,  you  can  observe  their  status¬ 
forming  rituals  and  techniques.  Each  lobster  will  first  begin  to  explore  the  new 
territory,  partly  to  map  its  details,  and  partly  to  find  a  good  place  for  shelter. 
Lobsters  learn  a  lot  about  where  they  live,  and  they  remember  what  they  learn.  If 
you  startle  one  near  its  nest,  it  will  quickly  zip  back  and  hide  there.  If  you  startle 
it  some  distance  away,  however,  it  will  immediately  dart  towards  the  nearest 
suitable  shelter,  previously  identified  and  now  remembered. 

A  lobster  needs  a  safe  hiding  place  to  rest,  free  from  predators  and  the  forces 
of  nature.  Furthermore,  as  lobsters  grow,  they  moult,  or  shed  their  shells,  which 
leaves  them  soft  and  vulnerable  for  extended  periods  of  time.  A  burrow  under  a 
rock  makes  a  good  lobster  home,  particularly  if  it  is  located  where  shells  and 
other  detritus  can  be  dragged  into  place  to  cover  the  entrance,  once  the  lobster  is 
snugly  ensconced  inside.  However,  there  may  be  only  a  small  number  of  high- 
quality  shelters  or  hiding  places  in  each  new  territory.  They  are  scarce  and 
valuable.  Other  lobsters  continually  seek  them  out. 

This  means  that  lobsters  often  encounter  one  another  when  out  exploring. 
Researchers  have  demonstrated  that  even  a  lobster  raised  in  isolation  knows 
what  to  do  when  such  a  thing  happens.  It  has  complex  defensive  and  aggressive 
behaviours  built  right  into  its  nervous  system.  It  begins  to  dance  around,  like  a 
boxer,  opening  and  raising  its  claws,  moving  backward,  forward,  and  side  to 
side,  mirroring  its  opponent,  waving  its  opened  claws  back  and  forth.  At  the 
same  time,  it  employs  special  jets  under  its  eyes  to  direct  streams  of  liquid  at  its 
opponent.  The  liquid  spray  contains  a  mix  of  chemicals  that  tell  the  other  lobster 
about  its  size,  sex,  health,  and  mood. 

Sometimes  one  lobster  can  tell  immediately  from  the  display  of  claw  size  that 
it  is  much  smaller  than  its  opponent,  and  will  back  down  without  a  fight.  The 
chemical  information  exchanged  in  the  spray  can  have  the  same  effect, 
convincing  a  less  healthy  or  less  aggressive  lobster  to  retreat.  That’s  dispute 
resolution  Level  1.-  If  the  two  lobsters  are  very  close  in  size  and  apparent  ability, 
however,  or  if  the  exchange  of  liquid  has  been  insufficiently  informative,  they 
will  proceed  to  dispute  resolution  Level  2.  With  antennae  whipping  madly  and 
claws  folded  downward,  one  will  advance,  and  the  other  retreat.  Then  the 
defender  will  advance,  and  the  aggressor  retreat.  After  a  couple  of  rounds  of  this 
behaviour,  the  more  nervous  of  the  lobsters  may  feel  that  continuing  is  not  in  his 


best  interest.  He  will  flick  his  tail  reflexively,  dart  backwards,  and  vanish,  to  try 
his  luck  elsewhere.  If  neither  blinks,  however,  the  lobsters  move  to  Level  3, 
which  involves  genuine  combat. 

This  time,  the  now  enraged  lobsters  come  at  each  other  viciously,  with  their 
claws  extended,  to  grapple.  Each  tries  to  flip  the  other  on  its  back.  A  successfully 
flipped  lobster  will  conclude  that  its  opponent  is  capable  of  inflicting  serious 
damage.  It  generally  gives  up  and  leaves  (although  it  harbours  intense 
resentment  and  gossips  endlessly  about  the  victor  behind  its  back).  If  neither  can 
overturn  the  other — or  if  one  will  not  quit  despite  being  flipped — the  lobsters 
move  to  Level  4.  Doing  so  involves  extreme  risk,  and  is  not  something  to  be 
engaged  in  without  forethought:  one  or  both  lobsters  will  emerge  damaged  from 
the  ensuing  fray,  perhaps  fatally. 

The  animals  advance  on  each  other,  with  increasing  speed.  Their  claws  are 
open,  so  they  can  grab  a  leg,  or  antenna,  or  an  eye-stalk,  or  anything  else 
exposed  and  vulnerable.  Once  a  body  part  has  been  successfully  grabbed,  the 
grabber  will  tail-flick  backwards,  sharply,  with  claw  clamped  firmly  shut,  and  try 
to  tear  it  off.  Disputes  that  have  escalated  to  this  point  typically  create  a  clear 
winner  and  loser.  The  loser  is  unlikely  to  survive,  particularly  if  he  or  she 
remains  in  the  territory  occupied  by  the  winner,  now  a  mortal  enemy. 

In  the  aftermath  of  a  losing  battle,  regardless  of  how  aggressively  a  lobster  has 
behaved,  it  becomes  unwilling  to  fight  further,  even  against  another,  previously 
defeated  opponent.  A  vanquished  competitor  loses  confidence,  sometimes  for 
days.  Sometimes  the  defeat  can  have  even  more  severe  consequences.  If  a 
dominant  lobster  is  badly  defeated,  its  brain  basically  dissolves.  Then  it  grows  a 
new,  subordinate’s  brain — one  more  appropriate  to  its  new,  lowly  position.-  Its 
original  brain  just  isn’t  sophisticated  to  manage  the  transformation  from  king  to 
bottom  dog  without  virtually  complete  dissolution  and  regrowth.  Anyone  who 
has  experienced  a  painful  transformation  after  a  serious  defeat  in  romance  or 
career  may  feel  some  sense  of  kinship  with  the  once  successful  crustacean. 

The  Neurochemistry  of  Defeat  and  Victory 

A  lobster  loser’s  brain  chemistry  differs  importantly  from  that  of  a  lobster 
winner.  This  is  reflected  in  their  relative  postures.  Whether  a  lobster  is  confident 
or  cringing  depends  on  the  ratio  of  two  chemicals  that  modulate  communication 
between  lobster  neurons:  serotonin  and  octopamine.  Winning  increases  the  ratio 
of  the  former  to  the  latter. 

A  lobster  with  high  levels  of  serotonin  and  low  levels  of  octopamine  is  a 
cocky,  strutting  sort  of  shellfish,  much  less  likely  to  back  down  when 


challenged.  This  is  because  serotonin  helps  regulate  postural  flexion.  A  flexed 
lobster  extends  its  appendages  so  that  it  can  look  tall  and  dangerous,  like  Clint 
Eastwood  in  a  spaghetti  Western.  When  a  lobster  that  has  just  lost  a  battle  is 
exposed  to  serotonin,  it  will  stretch  itself  out,  advance  even  on  former  victors, 
and  fight  longer  and  harder.  The  drugs  prescribed  to  depressed  human  beings, 
which  are  selective  serotonin  reuptake  inhibitors,  have  much  the  same  chemical 
and  behavioural  effect.  In  one  of  the  more  staggering  demonstrations  of  the 
evolutionary  continuity  of  life  on  Earth,  Prozac  even  cheers  up  lobsters. 

High  serotonin/low  octopamine  characterizes  the  victor.  The  opposite 
neurochemical  configuration,  a  high  ratio  of  octopamine  to  serotonin,  produces  a 
defeated-looking,  scrunched-up,  inhibited,  drooping,  skulking  sort  of  lobster, 
very  likely  to  hang  around  street  corners,  and  to  vanish  at  the  first  hint  of 
trouble.  Serotonin  and  octopamine  also  regulate  the  tail-flick  reflex,  which 
serves  to  propel  a  lobster  rapidly  backwards  when  it  needs  to  escape.  Less 
provocation  is  necessary  to  trigger  that  reflex  in  a  defeated  lobster.  You  can  see 
an  echo  of  that  in  the  heightened  startle  reflex  characteristic  of  the  soldier  or 
battered  child  with  post-traumatic  stress  disorder. 

The  Principle  of  Unequal  Distribution 

When  a  defeated  lobster  regains  its  courage  and  dares  to  fight  again  it  is  more 
likely  to  lose  again  than  you  would  predict,  statistically,  from  a  tally  of  its 
previous  fights.  Its  victorious  opponent,  on  the  other  hand,  is  more  likely  to  win. 
It’s  winner-take-all  in  the  lobster  world,  just  as  it  is  in  human  societies,  where 
the  top  1  percent  have  as  much  loot  as  the  bottom  50  percent  — and  where  the 
richest  eighty-five  people  have  as  much  as  the  bottom  three  and  a  half  billion. 

That  same  brutal  principle  of  unequal  distribution  applies  outside  the  financial 
domain — indeed,  anywhere  that  creative  production  is  required.  The  majority  of 
scientific  papers  are  published  by  a  very  small  group  of  scientists.  A  tiny 
proportion  of  musicians  produces  almost  all  the  recorded  commercial  music.  Just 
a  handful  of  authors  sell  all  the  books.  A  million  and  a  half  separately  titled 
books  (!)  sell  each  year  in  the  US.  However,  only  five  hundred  of  these  sell  more 
than  a  hundred  thousand  copies.  Similarly,  just  four  classical  composers  (Bach, 
Beethoven,  Mozart,  and  Tchaikovsky)  wrote  almost  all  the  music  played  by 
modern  orchestras.  Bach,  for  his  part,  composed  so  prolifically  that  it  would  take 
decades  of  work  merely  to  hand-copy  his  scores,  yet  only  a  small  fraction  of  this 
prodigious  output  is  commonly  performed.  The  same  thing  applies  to  the  output 
of  the  other  three  members  of  this  group  of  hyper-dominant  composers:  only  a 


small  fraction  of  their  work  is  still  widely  played.  Thus,  a  small  fraction  of  the 
music  composed  by  a  small  fraction  of  all  the  classical  composers  who  have  ever 
composed  makes  up  almost  all  the  classical  music  that  the  world  knows  and 
loves. 

This  principle  is  sometimes  known  as  Price’s  law,  after  Derek  J.  de  Solla 
Price,  the  researcher  who  discovered  its  application  in  science  in  1963.  It  can 
be  modelled  using  an  approximately  L-shaped  graph,  with  number  of  people  on 
the  vertical  axis,  and  productivity  or  resources  on  the  horizontal.  The  basic 
principle  had  been  discovered  much  earlier.  Vilfredo  Pareto  (1848-1923),  an 
Italian  polymath,  noticed  its  applicability  to  wealth  distribution  in  the  early 
twentieth  century,  and  it  appears  true  for  every  society  ever  studied,  regardless  of 
governmental  form.  It  also  applies  to  the  population  of  cities  (a  very  small 
number  have  almost  all  the  people),  the  mass  of  heavenly  bodies  (a  very  small 
number  hoard  all  the  matter),  and  the  frequency  of  words  in  a  language  (90 
percent  of  communication  occurs  using  just  500  words),  among  many  other 
things.  Sometimes  it  is  known  as  the  Matthew  Principle  (Matthew  25:29), 
derived  from  what  might  be  the  harshest  statement  ever  attributed  to  Christ:  “to 
those  who  have  everything,  more  will  be  given;  from  those  who  have  nothing, 
everything  will  be  taken.” 

You  truly  know  you  are  the  Son  of  God  when  your  dicta  apply  even  to 
crustaceans. 

Back  to  the  fractious  shellfish:  it  doesn’t  take  that  long  before  lobsters,  testing 
each  other  out,  learn  who  can  be  messed  with  and  who  should  be  given  a  wide 
berth — and  once  they  have  learned,  the  resultant  hierarchy  is  exceedingly  stable. 
All  a  victor  needs  to  do,  once  he  has  won,  is  to  wiggle  his  antennae  in  a 
threatening  manner,  and  a  previous  opponent  will  vanish  in  a  puff  of  sand  before 
him.  A  weaker  lobster  will  quit  trying,  accept  his  lowly  status,  and  keep  his  legs 
attached  to  his  body.  The  top  lobster,  by  contrast — occupying  the  best  shelter, 
getting  some  good  rest,  finishing  a  good  meal — parades  his  dominance  around 
his  territory,  rousting  subordinate  lobsters  from  their  shelters  at  night,  just  to 
remind  them  who’s  their  daddy. 

All  the  Girls 

The  female  lobsters  (who  also  fight  hard  for  territory  during  the  explicitly 
maternal  stages  of  their  existence  )  identify  the  top  guy  quickly,  and  become 
irresistibly  attracted  to  him.  This  is  brilliant  strategy,  in  my  estimation.  It’s  also 
one  used  by  females  of  many  different  species,  including  humans.  Instead  of 
undertaking  the  computationally  difficult  task  of  identifying  the  best  man,  the 


females  outsource  the  problem  to  the  machine-like  calculations  of  the  dominance 
hierarchy.  They  let  the  males  fight  it  out  and  peel  their  paramours  from  the  top. 
This  is  very  much  what  happens  with  stock-market  pricing,  where  the  value  of 
any  particular  enterprise  is  determined  through  the  competition  of  all. 

When  the  females  are  ready  to  shed  their  shells  and  soften  up  a  bit,  they 
become  interested  in  mating.  They  start  hanging  around  the  dominant  lobster’s 
pad,  spraying  attractive  scents  and  aphrodisiacs  towards  him,  trying  to  seduce 
him.  His  aggression  has  made  him  successful,  so  he’s  likely  to  react  in  a 
dominant,  irritable  manner.  Furthermore,  he’s  large,  healthy  and  powerful.  It’s  no 
easy  task  to  switch  his  attention  from  fighting  to  mating.  (If  properly  charmed, 
however,  he  will  change  his  behaviour  towards  the  female.  This  is  the  lobster 
equivalent  of  Fifty  Shades  of  Grey,  the  fastest-selling  paperback  of  all  time,  and 
the  eternal  Beauty-and-the-Beast  plot  of  archetypal  romance.  This  is  the  pattern 
of  behaviour  continually  represented  in  the  sexually  explicit  literary  fantasies 
that  are  as  popular  among  women  as  provocative  images  of  naked  women  are 
among  men.) 

It  should  be  pointed  out,  however,  that  sheer  physical  power  is  an  unstable 
basis  on  which  to  found  lasting  dominance,  as  the  Dutch  primatologist  Frans  de 
Waal  has  taken  pains  to  demonstrate.  Among  the  chimp  troupes  he  studied, 
males  who  were  successful  in  the  longer  term  had  to  buttress  their  physical 
prowess  with  more  sophisticated  attributes.  Even  the  most  brutal  chimp  despot 
can  be  taken  down,  after  all,  by  two  opponents,  each  three-quarters  as  mean.  In 
consequence,  males  who  stay  on  top  longer  are  those  who  form  reciprocal 
coalitions  with  their  lower-status  compatriots,  and  who  pay  careful  attention  to 
the  troupe’s  females  and  their  infants.  The  political  ploy  of  baby-kissing  is 
literally  millions  of  years  old.  But  lobsters  are  still  comparatively  primitive,  so 
the  bare  plot  elements  of  Beast  and  Beauty  suffice  for  them. 

Once  the  Beast  has  been  successfully  charmed,  the  successful  female  (lobster) 
will  disrobe,  shedding  her  shell,  making  herself  dangerously  soft,  vulnerable, 
and  ready  to  mate.  At  the  right  moment,  the  male,  now  converted  into  a  careful 
lover,  deposits  a  packet  of  sperm  into  the  appropriate  receptacle.  Afterward,  the 
female  hangs  around,  and  hardens  up  for  a  couple  of  weeks  (another 
phenomenon  not  entirely  unknown  among  human  beings).  At  her  leisure,  she 
returns  to  her  own  domicile,  laden  with  fertilized  eggs.  At  this  point  another 
female  will  attempt  the  same  thing — and  so  on.  The  dominant  male,  with  his 
upright  and  confident  posture,  not  only  gets  the  prime  real  estate  and  easiest 
access  to  the  best  hunting  grounds.  He  also  gets  all  the  girls.  It  is  exponentially 
more  worthwhile  to  be  successful,  if  you  are  a  lobster,  and  male. 

Why  is  all  this  relevant?  For  an  amazing  number  of  reasons,  apart  from  those 


that  are  comically  obvious.  First,  we  know  that  lobsters  have  been  around,  in  one 
form  or  another,  for  more  than  350  million  years.  This  is  a  very  long  time. 
Sixty-five  million  years  ago,  there  were  still  dinosaurs.  That  is  the  unimaginably 
distant  past  to  us.  To  the  lobsters,  however,  dinosaurs  were  the  nouveau  riche, 
who  appeared  and  disappeared  in  the  flow  of  near-eternal  time.  This  means  that 
dominance  hierarchies  have  been  an  essentially  permanent  feature  of  the 
environment  to  which  all  complex  life  has  adapted.  A  third  of  a  billion  years  ago, 
brains  and  nervous  systems  were  comparatively  simple.  Nonetheless,  they 
already  had  the  structure  and  neurochemistry  necessary  to  process  information 
about  status  and  society.  The  importance  of  this  fact  can  hardly  be  overstated. 

The  Nature  of  Nature 

It  is  a  truism  of  biology  that  evolution  is  conservative.  When  something  evolves, 
it  must  build  upon  what  nature  has  already  produced.  New  features  may  be 
added,  and  old  features  may  undergo  some  alteration,  but  most  things  remain  the 
same.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  wings  of  bats,  the  hands  of  human  beings,  and 
the  fins  of  whales  look  astonishingly  alike  in  their  skeletal  form.  They  even  have 
the  same  number  of  bones.  Evolution  laid  down  the  cornerstones  for  basic 
physiology  long  ago. 

Now  evolution  works,  in  large  part,  through  variation  and  natural  selection. 
Variation  exists  for  many  reasons,  including  gene-shuffling  (to  put  it  simply)  and 
random  mutation.  Individuals  vary  within  a  species  for  such  reasons.  Nature 
chooses  from  among  them,  across  time.  That  theory,  as  stated,  appears  to 
account  for  the  continual  alteration  of  life-forms  over  the  eons.  But  there’s  an 
additional  question  lurking  under  the  surface:  what  exactly  is  the  “nature”  in 
“natural  selection”?  What  exactly  is  “the  environment”  to  which  animals  adapt? 
We  make  many  assumptions  about  nature — about  the  environment — and  these 
have  consequences.  Mark  Twain  once  said,  “It’s  not  what  we  don’t  know  that 
gets  us  in  trouble.  It’s  what  we  know  for  sure  that  just  ain’t  so.” 

First,  it  is  easy  to  assume  that  “nature”  is  something  with  a  nature — something 
static.  But  it’s  not:  at  least  not  in  any  simple  sense.  It’s  static  and  dynamic,  at  the 
same  time.  The  environment — the  nature  that  selects — itself  transforms.  The 
famous  yin  and  yang  symbols  of  the  Taoists  capture  this  beautifully.  Being,  for 
the  Taoists — reality  itself — is  composed  of  two  opposing  principles,  often 
translated  as  feminine  and  masculine,  or  even  more  narrowly  as  female  and 
male.  However,  yin  and  yang  are  more  accurately  understood  as  chaos  and  order. 
The  Taoist  symbol  is  a  circle  enclosing  twin  serpents,  head  to  tail.  The  black 
serpent,  chaos,  has  a  white  dot  in  its  head.  The  white  serpent,  order,  has  a  black 


dot  in  its  head.  This  is  because  chaos  and  order  are  interchangeable,  as  well  as 
eternally  juxtaposed.  There  is  nothing  so  certain  that  it  cannot  vary.  Even  the  sun 
itself  has  its  cycles  of  instability.  Likewise,  there  is  nothing  so  mutable  that  it 
cannot  be  fixed.  Every  revolution  produces  a  new  order.  Every  death  is, 
simultaneously,  a  metamorphosis. 

Considering  nature  as  purely  static  produces  serious  errors  of  apprehension. 
Nature  “selects.”  The  idea  of  selects  contains  implicitly  nested  within  it  the  idea 
of  fitness.  It  is  “fitness”  that  is  “selected.”  Fitness,  roughly  speaking,  is  the 
probability  that  a  given  organism  will  leave  offspring  (will  propagate  its  genes 
through  time).  The  “fit”  in  “fitness”  is  therefore  the  matching  of  organismal 
attribute  to  environmental  demand.  If  that  demand  is  conceptualized  as  static — if 
nature  is  conceptualized  as  eternal  and  unchanging — then  evolution  is  a  never- 
ending  series  of  linear  improvements,  and  fitness  is  something  that  can  be  ever 
more  closely  approximated  across  time.  The  still-powerful  Victorian  idea  of 
evolutionary  progress,  with  man  at  the  pinnacle,  is  a  partial  consequence  of  this 
model  of  nature.  It  produces  the  erroneous  notion  that  there  is  a  destination  of 
natural  selection  (increasing  fitness  to  the  environment),  and  that  it  can  be 
conceptualized  as  a  fixed  point. 

But  nature,  the  selecting  agent,  is  not  a  static  selector — not  in  any  simple 
sense.  Nature  dresses  differently  for  each  occasion.  Nature  varies  like  a  musical 
score — and  that,  in  part,  explains  why  music  produces  its  deep  intimations  of 
meaning.  As  the  environment  supporting  a  species  transforms  and  changes,  the 
features  that  make  a  given  individual  successful  in  surviving  and  reproducing 
also  transform  and  change.  Thus,  the  theory  of  natural  selection  does  not  posit 
creatures  matching  themselves  ever  more  precisely  to  a  template  specified  by  the 
world.  It  is  more  that  creatures  are  in  a  dance  with  nature,  albeit  one  that  is 
deadly.  “In  my  kingdom,”  as  the  Red  Queen  tells  Alice  in  Wonderland,  “you 
have  to  run  as  fast  as  you  can  just  to  stay  in  the  same  place.”  No  one  standing 
still  can  triumph,  no  matter  how  well  constituted. 

Nature  is  not  simply  dynamic,  either.  Some  things  change  quickly,  but  they  are 
nested  within  other  things  that  change  less  quickly  (music  frequently  models 
this,  too).  Leaves  change  more  quickly  than  trees,  and  trees  more  quickly  than 
forests.  Weather  changes  faster  than  climate.  If  it  wasn’t  this  way,  then  the 
conservatism  of  evolution  would  not  work,  as  the  basic  morphology  of  arms  and 
hands  would  have  to  change  as  fast  as  the  length  of  arm  bones  and  the  function 
of  fingers.  It’s  chaos,  within  order,  within  chaos,  within  higher  order.  The  order 
that  is  most  real  is  the  order  that  is  most  unchanging — and  that  is  not  necessarily 
the  order  that  is  most  easily  seen.  The  leaf,  when  perceived,  might  blind  the 
observer  to  the  tree.  The  tree  can  blind  him  to  the  forest.  And  some  things  that 


are  most  real  (such  as  the  ever-present  dominance  hierarchy)  cannot  be  “seen”  at 
all. 

It  is  also  a  mistake  to  conceptualize  nature  romantically.  Rich,  modern  city- 
dwellers,  surrounded  by  hot,  baking  concrete,  imagine  the  environment  as 
something  pristine  and  paradisal,  like  a  French  impressionist  landscape.  Eco- 
activists,  even  more  idealistic  in  their  viewpoint,  envision  nature  as 
harmoniously  balanced  and  perfect,  absent  the  disruptions  and  depredations  of 
mankind.  Unfortunately,  “the  environment”  is  also  elephantiasis  and  guinea 
worms  (don’t  ask),  anopheles  mosquitoes  and  malaria,  starvation-level  droughts, 
AIDS  and  the  Black  Plague.  We  don’t  fantasize  about  the  beauty  of  these  aspects 
of  nature,  although  they  are  just  as  real  as  their  Edenic  counterparts.  It  is  because 
of  the  existence  of  such  things,  of  course,  that  we  attempt  to  modify  our 
surroundings,  protecting  our  children,  building  cities  and  transportation  systems 
and  growing  food  and  generating  power.  If  Mother  Nature  wasn’t  so  hell-bent  on 
our  destruction,  it  would  be  easier  for  us  to  exist  in  simple  harmony  with  her 
dictates. 

And  this  brings  us  to  a  third  erroneous  concept:  that  nature  is  something 
strictly  segregated  from  the  cultural  constructs  that  have  emerged  within  it.  The 
order  within  the  chaos  and  order  of  Being  is  all  the  more  “natural”  the  longer  it 
has  lasted.  This  is  because  “nature”  is  “what  selects,”  and  the  longer  a  feature 
has  existed  the  more  time  it  has  had  to  be  selected — and  to  shape  life.  It  does  not 
matter  whether  that  feature  is  physical  and  biological,  or  social  and  cultural.  All 
that  matters,  from  a  Darwinian  perspective,  is  permanence — and  the  dominance 
hierarchy,  however  social  or  cultural  it  might  appear,  has  been  around  for  some 
half  a  billion  years.  It’s  permanent.  It’s  real.  The  dominance  hierarchy  is  not 
capitalism.  It’s  not  communism,  either,  for  that  matter.  It’s  not  the  military- 
industrial  complex.  It’s  not  the  patriarchy — that  disposable,  malleable,  arbitrary 
cultural  artefact.  It’s  not  even  a  human  creation;  not  in  the  most  profound  sense. 
It  is  instead  a  near-eternal  aspect  of  the  environment,  and  much  of  what  is 
blamed  on  these  more  ephemeral  manifestations  is  a  consequence  of  its 
unchanging  existence.  We  (the  sovereign  we,  the  we  that  has  been  around  since 
the  beginning  of  life)  have  lived  in  a  dominance  hierarchy  for  a  long,  long  time. 
We  were  struggling  for  position  before  we  had  skin,  or  hands,  or  lungs,  or  bones. 
There  is  little  more  natural  than  culture.  Dominance  hierarchies  are  older  than 
trees. 

The  part  of  our  brain  that  keeps  track  of  our  position  in  the  dominance 
hierarchy  is  therefore  exceptionally  ancient  and  fundamental.  It  is  a  master 
control  system,  modulating  our  perceptions,  values,  emotions,  thoughts  and 
actions.  It  powerfully  affects  every  aspect  of  our  Being,  conscious  and 


unconscious  alike.  This  is  why,  when  we  are  defeated,  we  act  very  much  like 
lobsters  who  have  lost  a  fight.  Our  posture  droops.  We  face  the  ground.  We  feel 
threatened,  hurt,  anxious  and  weak.  If  things  do  not  improve,  we  become 
chronically  depressed.  Under  such  conditions,  we  can’t  easily  put  up  the  kind  of 
fight  that  life  demands,  and  we  become  easy  targets  for  harder-shelled  bullies. 
And  it  is  not  only  the  behavioural  and  experiential  similarities  that  are  striking. 
Much  of  the  basic  neurochemistry  is  the  same. 

Consider  serotonin,  the  chemical  that  governs  posture  and  escape  in  the 
lobster.  Low-ranking  lobsters  produce  comparatively  low  levels  of  serotonin. 
This  is  also  true  of  low-ranking  human  beings  (and  those  low  levels  decrease 
more  with  each  defeat).  Low  serotonin  means  decreased  confidence.  Low 
serotonin  means  more  response  to  stress  and  costlier  physical  preparedness  for 
emergency — as  anything  whatsoever  may  happen,  at  any  time,  at  the  bottom  of 
the  dominance  hierarchy  (and  rarely  something  good).  Low  serotonin  means  less 
happiness,  more  pain  and  anxiety,  more  illness,  and  a  shorter  lifespan — among 
humans,  just  as  among  crustaceans.  Higher  spots  in  the  dominance  hierarchy, 
and  the  higher  serotonin  levels  typical  of  those  who  inhabit  them,  are 
characterized  by  less  illness,  misery  and  death,  even  when  factors  such  as 
absolute  income — or  number  of  decaying  food  scraps — are  held  constant.  The 
importance  of  this  can  hardly  be  overstated. 

Top  and  Bottom 

There  is  an  unspeakably  primordial  calculator,  deep  within  you,  at  the  very 
foundation  of  your  brain,  far  below  your  thoughts  and  feelings.  It  monitors 
exactly  where  you  are  positioned  in  society — on  a  scale  of  one  to  ten,  for  the 
sake  of  argument.  If  you’re  a  number  one,  the  highest  level  of  status,  you’re  an 
overwhelming  success.  If  you’re  male,  you  have  preferential  access  to  the  best 
places  to  live  and  the  highest-quality  food.  People  compete  to  do  you  favours. 
You  have  limitless  opportunity  for  romantic  and  sexual  contact.  You  are  a 
successful  lobster,  and  the  most  desirable  females  line  up  and  vie  for  your 
attention. 

If  you’re  female,  you  have  access  to  many  high-quality  suitors:  tall,  strong  and 
symmetrical;  creative,  reliable,  honest  and  generous.  And,  like  your  dominant 
male  counterpart,  you  will  compete  ferociously,  even  pitilessly,  to  maintain  or 
improve  your  position  in  the  equally  competitive  female  mating  hierarchy. 
Although  you  are  less  likely  to  use  physical  aggression  to  do  so,  there  are  many 
effective  verbal  tricks  and  strategies  at  your  disposal,  including  the  disparaging 
of  opponents,  and  you  may  well  be  expert  at  their  use. 


If  you  are  a  low-status  ten,  by  contrast,  male  or  female,  you  have  nowhere  to 
live  (or  nowhere  good).  Your  food  is  terrible,  when  you’re  not  going  hungry. 
You’re  in  poor  physical  and  mental  condition.  You’re  of  minimal  romantic 
interest  to  anyone,  unless  they  are  as  desperate  as  you.  You  are  more  likely  to 
fall  ill,  age  rapidly,  and  die  young,  with  few,  if  any,  to  mourn  you.  Even  money 
itself  may  prove  of  little  use.  You  won’t  know  how  to  use  it,  because  it  is 
difficult  to  use  money  properly,  particularly  if  you  are  unfamiliar  with  it.  Money 
will  make  you  liable  to  the  dangerous  temptations  of  drugs  and  alcohol,  which 
are  much  more  rewarding  if  you  have  been  deprived  of  pleasure  for  a  long 
period.  Money  will  also  make  you  a  target  for  predators  and  psychopaths,  who 
thrive  on  exploiting  those  who  exist  on  the  lower  rungs  of  society.  The  bottom  of 
the  dominance  hierarchy  is  a  terrible,  dangerous  place  to  be. 

The  ancient  part  of  your  brain  specialized  for  assessing  dominance  watches 
how  you  are  treated  by  other  people.  On  that  evidence,  it  renders  a  determination 
of  your  value  and  assigns  you  a  status.  If  you  are  judged  by  your  peers  as  of  little 
worth,  the  counter  restricts  serotonin  availability.  That  makes  you  much  more 
physically  and  psychologically  reactive  to  any  circumstance  or  event  that  might 
produce  emotion,  particularly  if  it  is  negative.  You  need  that  reactivity. 
Emergencies  are  common  at  the  bottom,  and  you  must  be  ready  to  survive. 

Unfortunately,  that  physical  hyper-response,  that  constant  alertness,  burns  up  a 
lot  of  precious  energy  and  physical  resources.  This  response  is  really  what 
everyone  calls  stress,  and  it  is  by  no  means  only  or  even  primarily  psychological. 
It’s  a  reflection  of  the  genuine  constraints  of  unfortunate  circumstances.  When 
operating  at  the  bottom,  the  ancient  brain  counter  assumes  that  even  the  smallest 
unexpected  impediment  might  produce  an  uncontrollable  chain  of  negative 
events,  which  will  have  to  be  handled  alone,  as  useful  friends  are  rare  indeed,  on 
society’s  fringes.  You  will  therefore  continually  sacrifice  what  you  could 
otherwise  physically  store  for  the  future,  using  it  up  on  heightened  readiness  and 
the  possibility  of  immediate  panicked  action  in  the  present.  When  you  don’t 
know  what  to  do,  you  must  be  prepared  to  do  anything  and  everything,  in  case  it 
becomes  necessary.  You’re  sitting  in  your  car  with  the  gas  and  brake  pedals  both 
punched  to  the  mat.  Too  much  of  that  and  everything  falls  apart.  The  ancient 
counter  will  even  shut  down  your  immune  system,  expending  the  energy  and 
resources  required  for  future  health  now,  during  the  crises  of  the  present.  It  will 
render  you  impulsive,  so  that  you  will  jump,  for  example,  at  any  short-term 
mating  opportunities,  or  any  possibilities  of  pleasure,  no  matter  how  sub-par, 
disgraceful  or  illegal.  It  will  leave  you  far  more  likely  to  live,  or  die,  carelessly, 


for  a  rare  opportunity  at  pleasure,  when  it  manifests  itself.  The  physical  demands 
of  emergency  preparedness  will  wear  you  down  in  every  way. 

If  you  have  a  high  status,  on  the  other  hand,  the  counter’s  cold,  pre-reptilian 
mechanics  assume  that  your  niche  is  secure,  productive  and  safe,  and  that  you 
are  well  buttressed  with  social  support.  It  thinks  the  chance  that  something  will 
damage  you  is  low  and  can  be  safely  discounted.  Change  might  be  opportunity, 
instead  of  disaster.  The  serotonin  flows  plentifully.  This  renders  you  confident 
and  calm,  standing  tall  and  straight,  and  much  less  on  constant  alert.  Because 
your  position  is  secure,  the  future  is  likely  to  be  good  for  you.  It’s  worthwhile  to 
think  in  the  long  term  and  plan  for  a  better  tomorrow.  You  don’t  need  to  grasp 
impulsively  at  whatever  crumbs  come  your  way,  because  you  can  realistically 
expect  good  things  to  remain  available.  You  can  delay  gratification,  without 
forgoing  it  forever.  You  can  afford  to  be  a  reliable  and  thoughtful  citizen. 

Malfunction 

Sometimes,  however,  the  counter  mechanism  can  go  wrong.  Erratic  habits  of 
sleeping  and  eating  can  interfere  with  its  function.  Uncertainty  can  throw  it  for  a 
loop.  The  body,  with  its  various  parts,  needs  to  function  like  a  well-rehearsed 
orchestra.  Every  system  must  play  its  role  properly,  and  at  exactly  the  right  time, 
or  noise  and  chaos  ensue.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  routine  is  so  necessary.  The 
acts  of  life  we  repeat  every  day  need  to  be  automatized.  They  must  be  turned 
into  stable  and  reliable  habits,  so  they  lose  their  complexity  and  gain 
predictability  and  simplicity.  This  can  be  perceived  most  clearly  in  the  case  of 
small  children,  who  are  delightful  and  comical  and  playful  when  their  sleeping 
and  eating  schedules  are  stable,  and  horrible  and  whiny  and  nasty  when  they  are 
not. 

It  is  for  such  reasons  that  I  always  ask  my  clinical  clients  first  about  sleep.  Do 
they  wake  up  in  the  morning  at  approximately  the  time  the  typical  person  wakes 
up,  and  at  the  same  time  every  day?  If  the  answer  is  no,  fixing  that  is  the  first 
thing  I  recommend.  It  doesn’t  matter  so  much  if  they  go  to  bed  at  the  same  time 
each  evening,  but  waking  up  at  a  consistent  hour  is  a  necessity.  Anxiety  and 
depression  cannot  be  easily  treated  if  the  sufferer  has  unpredictable  daily 
routines.  The  systems  that  mediate  negative  emotion  are  tightly  tied  to  the 
properly  cyclical  circadian  rhythms. 

The  next  thing  I  ask  about  is  breakfast.  I  counsel  my  clients  to  eat  a  fat  and 
protein-heavy  breakfast  as  soon  as  possible  after  they  awaken  (no  simple 
carbohydrates,  no  sugars,  as  they  are  digested  too  rapidly,  and  produce  a  blood- 
sugar  spike  and  rapid  dip).  This  is  because  anxious  and  depressed  people  are 


already  stressed,  particularly  if  their  lives  have  not  been  under  control  for  a  good 
while.  Their  bodies  are  therefore  primed  to  hypersecrete  insulin,  if  they  engage 
in  any  complex  or  demanding  activity.  If  they  do  so  after  fasting  all  night  and 
before  eating,  the  excess  insulin  in  their  bloodstream  will  mop  up  all  their  blood 
sugar.  Then  they  become  hypoglycemic  and  psycho-physiologically  unstable. 

All  day.  Their  systems  cannot  be  reset  until  after  more  sleep.  I  have  had  many 
clients  whose  anxiety  was  reduced  to  subclinical  levels  merely  because  they 
started  to  sleep  on  a  predictable  schedule  and  eat  breakfast. 

Other  bad  habits  can  also  interfere  with  the  counter’s  accuracy.  Sometimes 
this  happens  directly,  for  poorly  understood  biological  reasons,  and  sometimes  it 
happens  because  those  habits  initiate  a  complex  positive  feedback  loop.  A 
positive  feedback  loop  requires  an  input  detector,  an  amplifier,  and  some  form  of 
output.  Imagine  a  signal  picked  up  by  the  input  detector,  amplified,  and  then 
emitted,  in  amplified  form.  So  far,  so  good.  The  trouble  starts  when  the  input 
detector  detects  that  output,  and  runs  it  through  the  system  again,  amplifying  and 
emitting  it  again.  A  few  rounds  of  intensification  and  things  get  dangerously  out 
of  control. 

Most  people  have  been  subject  to  the  deafening  howling  of  feedback  at  a 
concert,  when  the  sound  system  squeals  painfully.  The  microphone  sends  a 
signal  to  the  speakers.  The  speakers  emit  the  signal.  The  signal  can  be  picked  up 
by  the  microphone  and  sent  through  the  system  again,  if  it’s  too  loud  or  too  close 
to  the  speakers.  The  sound  rapidly  amplifies  to  unbearable  levels,  sufficient  to 
destroy  the  speakers,  if  it  continues. 

The  same  destructive  loop  happens  within  people’s  lives.  Much  of  the  time, 
when  it  happens,  we  label  it  mental  illness,  even  though  it’s  not  only  or  even  at 
all  occurring  inside  people’s  psyches.  Addiction  to  alcohol  or  another  mood- 
altering  drug  is  a  common  positive-feedback  process.  Imagine  a  person  who 
enjoys  alcohol,  perhaps  a  bit  too  much.  He  has  a  quick  three  or  four  drinks.  His 
blood  alcohol  level  spikes  sharply.  This  can  be  extremely  exhilarating, 
particularly  for  someone  who  has  a  genetic  predisposition  to  alcoholism.  But  it 
only  occurs  while  blood  alcohol  levels  are  actively  rising,  and  that  only 
continues  if  the  drinker  keeps  drinking.  When  he  stops,  not  only  does  his  blood 
alcohol  level  plateau  and  then  start  to  sink,  but  his  body  begins  to  produce  a 
variety  of  toxins,  as  it  metabolizes  the  ethanol  already  consumed.  He  also  starts 
to  experience  alcohol  withdrawal,  as  the  anxiety  systems  that  were  suppressed 
during  intoxication  start  to  hyper-respond.  A  hangover  is  alcohol  withdrawal 
(which  quite  frequently  kills  withdrawing  alcoholics),  and  it  starts  all  too  soon 
after  drinking  ceases.  To  continue  the  warm  glow,  and  stave  off  the  unpleasant 


aftermath,  the  drinker  may  just  continue  to  drink,  until  all  the  liquor  in  his  house 
is  consumed,  the  bars  are  closed  and  his  money  is  spent. 

The  next  day,  the  drinker  wakes  up,  badly  hungover.  So  far,  this  is  just 
unfortunate.  The  real  trouble  starts  when  he  discovers  that  his  hangover  can  be 
“cured”  with  a  few  more  drinks  the  morning  after.  Such  a  cure  is,  of  course, 
temporary.  It  merely  pushes  the  withdrawal  symptoms  a  bit  further  into  the 
future.  But  that  might  be  what  is  required,  in  the  short  term,  if  the  misery  is 
sufficiently  acute.  So  now  he  has  learned  to  drink  to  cure  his  hangover.  When  the 
medication  causes  the  disease,  a  positive  feedback  loop  has  been  established. 
Alcoholism  can  quickly  emerge  under  such  conditions. 

Something  similar  often  happens  to  people  who  develop  an  anxiety  disorder, 
such  as  agoraphobia.  People  with  agoraphobia  can  become  so  overwhelmed  with 
fear  that  they  will  no  longer  leave  their  homes.  Agoraphobia  is  the  consequence 
of  a  positive  feedback  loop.  The  first  event  that  precipitates  the  disorder  is  often 
a  panic  attack.  The  sufferer  is  typically  a  middle-aged  woman  who  has  been  too 
dependent  on  other  people.  Perhaps  she  went  immediately  from  over-reliance  on 
her  father  to  a  relationship  with  an  older  and  comparatively  dominant  boyfriend 
or  husband,  with  little  or  no  break  for  independent  existence. 

In  the  weeks  leading  up  to  the  emergence  of  her  agoraphobia,  such  a  woman 
typically  experiences  something  unexpected  and  anomalous.  It  might  be 
something  physiological,  such  as  heart  palpitations,  which  are  common  in  any 
case,  and  whose  likelihood  is  increased  during  menopause,  when  the  hormonal 
processes  regulating  a  women’s  psychological  experience  fluctuate 
unpredictably.  Any  perceptible  alteration  in  heart-rate  can  trigger  thoughts  both 
of  heart  attack  and  an  all-too-public  and  embarrassing  display  of  post-heart 
attack  distress  and  suffering  (death  and  social  humiliation  constituting  the  two 
most  basic  fears).  The  unexpected  occurrence  might  instead  be  conflict  in  the 
sufferer’s  marriage,  or  the  illness  or  death  of  a  spouse.  It  might  be  a  close 
friend’s  divorce  or  hospitalization.  Some  real  event  typically  precipitates  the 
initial  increase  in  fear  of  mortality  and  social  judgment. 

After  the  shock,  perhaps,  the  pre-agoraphobic  woman  leaves  her  house,  and 
makes  her  way  to  the  shopping  mall.  It’s  busy  and  difficult  to  park.  This  makes 
her  even  more  stressed.  The  thoughts  of  vulnerability  occupying  her  mind  since 
her  recent  unpleasant  experience  rise  close  to  the  surface.  They  trigger  anxiety. 
Her  heart  rate  rises.  She  begins  to  breathe  shallowly  and  quickly.  She  feels  her 
heart  racing  and  begins  to  wonder  if  she  is  suffering  a  heart  attack.  This  thought 
triggers  more  anxiety.  She  breathes  even  more  shallowly,  increasing  the  levels  of 
carbon  dioxide  in  her  blood.  Her  heart  rate  increases  again,  because  of  her 
additional  fear.  She  detects  that,  and  her  heart  rate  rises  again. 


Poof!  Positive  feedback  loop.  Soon  the  anxiety  transforms  into  panic, 
regulated  by  a  different  brain  system,  designed  for  the  severest  of  threats,  which 
can  be  triggered  by  too  much  fear.  She  is  overwhelmed  by  her  symptoms,  and 
heads  for  the  emergency  room,  where  after  an  anxious  wait  her  heart  function  is 
checked.  There  is  nothing  wrong.  But  she  is  not  reassured. 

It  takes  an  additional  feedback  loop  to  transform  even  that  unpleasant 
experience  into  full-blown  agoraphobia.  The  next  time  she  needs  to  go  to  the 
mall,  the  pre-agoraphobic  becomes  anxious,  remembering  what  happened  last 
time.  But  she  goes,  anyway.  On  the  way,  she  can  feel  her  heart  pounding.  That 
triggers  another  cycle  of  anxiety  and  concern.  To  forestall  panic,  she  avoids  the 
stress  of  the  mall  and  returns  home.  But  now  the  anxiety  systems  in  her  brain 
note  that  she  ran  away  from  the  mall,  and  conclude  that  the  journey  there  was 
truly  dangerous.  Our  anxiety  systems  are  very  practical.  They  assume  that 
anything  you  run  away  from  is  dangerous.  The  proof  of  that  is,  of  course,  the 
fact  you  ran  away. 

So  now  the  mall  is  tagged  “too  dangerous  to  approach”  (or  the  budding 
agoraphobic  has  labelled  herself,  “too  fragile  to  approach  the  mall”).  Perhaps 
that  is  not  yet  taking  things  far  enough  to  cause  her  real  trouble.  There  are  other 
places  to  shop.  But  maybe  the  nearby  supermarket  is  mall-like  enough  to  trigger 
a  similar  response,  when  she  visits  it  instead,  and  then  retreats.  Now  the 
supermarket  occupies  the  same  category.  Then  it’s  the  corner  store.  Then  it’s 
buses  and  taxis  and  subways.  Soon  it’s  everywhere.  The  agoraphobic  will  even 
eventually  become  afraid  of  her  house,  and  would  run  away  from  that  if  she 
could.  But  she  can’t.  Soon  she’s  stuck  in  her  home.  Anxiety-induced  retreat 
makes  everything  retreated  from  more  anxiety-inducing.  Anxiety-induced  retreat 
makes  the  self  smaller  and  the  ever-more-dangerous  world  larger. 

There  are  many  systems  of  interaction  between  brain,  body  and  social  world 
that  can  get  caught  in  positive  feedback  loops.  Depressed  people,  for  example, 
can  start  feeling  useless  and  burdensome,  as  well  as  grief-stricken  and  pained. 
This  makes  them  withdraw  from  contact  with  friends  and  family.  Then  the 
withdrawal  makes  them  more  lonesome  and  isolated,  and  more  likely  to  feel 
useless  and  burdensome.  Then  they  withdraw  more.  In  this  manner,  depression 
spirals  and  amplifies. 

If  someone  is  badly  hurt  at  some  point  in  life — traumatized — the  dominance 
counter  can  transform  in  a  manner  that  makes  additional  hurt  more  rather  than 
less  likely.  This  often  happens  in  the  case  of  people,  now  adults,  who  were 
viciously  bullied  during  childhood  or  adolescence.  They  become  anxious  and 
easily  upset.  They  shield  themselves  with  a  defensive  crouch,  and  avoid  the 
direct  eye  contact  interpretable  as  a  dominance  challenge. 


This  means  that  the  damage  caused  by  the  bullying  (the  lowering  of  status  and 
confidence)  can  continue,  even  after  the  bullying  has  ended.  In  the  simplest  of 
cases,  the  formerly  lowly  persons  have  matured  and  moved  to  new  and  more 
successful  places  in  their  lives.  But  they  don’t  fully  notice.  Their  now- 
counterproductive  physiological  adaptations  to  earlier  reality  remain,  and  they 
are  more  stressed  and  uncertain  than  is  necessary.  In  more  complex  cases,  a 
habitual  assumption  of  subordination  renders  the  person  more  stressed  and 
uncertain  than  necessary,  and  their  habitually  submissive  posturing  continues  to 
attract  genuine  negative  attention  from  one  or  more  of  the  fewer  and  generally 
less  successful  bullies  still  extant  in  the  adult  world.  In  such  situations,  the 
psychological  consequence  of  the  previous  bullying  increases  the  likelihood  of 
continued  bullying  in  the  present  (even  though,  strictly  speaking,  it  wouldn’t 
have  to,  because  of  maturation,  or  geographical  relocation,  or  continued 
education,  or  improvement  in  objective  status). 

Rising  Up 

Sometimes  people  are  bullied  because  they  can ’t  fight  back.  This  can  happen  to 
people  who  are  weaker,  physically,  than  their  opponents.  This  is  one  of  the  most 
common  reasons  for  the  bullying  experienced  by  children.  Even  the  toughest  of 
six-year-olds  is  no  match  for  someone  who  is  nine.  A  lot  of  that  power 
differential  disappears  in  adulthood,  however,  with  the  rough  stabilization  and 
matching  of  physical  size  (with  the  exception  of  that  pertaining  to  men  and 
women,  with  the  former  typically  larger  and  stronger,  particularly  in  the  upper 
body)  as  well  as  the  increased  penalties  generally  applied  in  adulthood  to  those 
who  insist  upon  continuing  with  physical  intimidation. 

But  just  as  often,  people  are  bullied  because  they  won’t  fight  back.  This 
happens  not  infrequently  to  people  who  are  by  temperament  compassionate  and 
self-sacrificing — particularly  if  they  are  also  high  in  negative  emotion,  and  make 
a  lot  of  gratifying  noises  of  suffering  when  someone  sadistic  confronts  them 
(children  who  cry  more  easily,  for  example,  are  more  frequently  bullied).  It 
also  happens  to  people  who  have  decided,  for  one  reason  or  another,  that  all 
forms  of  aggression,  including  even  feelings  of  anger,  are  morally  wrong.  I  have 
seen  people  with  a  particularly  acute  sensitivity  to  petty  tyranny  and  over- 
aggressive  competitiveness  restrict  within  themselves  all  the  emotions  that  might 
give  rise  to  such  things.  Often  they  are  people  whose  fathers  who  were 
excessively  angry  and  controlling.  Psychological  forces  are  never 
unidimensional  in  their  value,  however,  and  the  truly  appalling  potential  of  anger 
and  aggression  to  produce  cruelty  and  mayhem  are  balanced  by  the  ability  of 


those  primordial  forces  to  push  back  against  oppression,  speak  truth,  and 
motivate  resolute  movement  forward  in  times  of  strife,  uncertainty  and  danger. 

With  their  capacity  for  aggression  strait-jacketed  within  a  too-narrow  morality, 
those  who  are  only  or  merely  compassionate  and  self-sacrificing  (and  naive  and 
exploitable)  cannot  call  forth  the  genuinely  righteous  and  appropriately  self- 
protective  anger  necessary  to  defend  themselves.  If  you  can  bite,  you  generally 
don’t  have  to.  When  skillfully  integrated,  the  ability  to  respond  with  aggression 
and  violence  decreases  rather  than  increases  the  probability  that  actual 
aggression  will  become  necessary.  If  you  say  no,  early  in  the  cycle  of 
oppression,  and  you  mean  what  you  say  (which  means  you  state  your  refusal  in 
no  uncertain  terms  and  stand  behind  it)  then  the  scope  for  oppression  on  the  part 
of  oppressor  will  remain  properly  bounded  and  limited.  The  forces  of  tyranny 
expand  inexorably  to  fill  the  space  made  available  for  their  existence.  People 
who  refuse  to  muster  appropriately  self-protective  territorial  responses  are  laid 
open  to  exploitation  as  much  as  those  who  genuinely  can’t  stand  up  for  their  own 
rights  because  of  a  more  essential  inability  or  a  true  imbalance  in  power. 

Naive,  harmless  people  usually  guide  their  perceptions  and  actions  with  a  few 
simple  axioms:  people  are  basically  good;  no  one  really  wants  to  hurt  anyone 
else;  the  threat  (and,  certainly,  the  use)  of  force,  physical  or  otherwise,  is  wrong. 
These  axioms  collapse,  or  worse,  in  the  presence  of  individuals  who  are 
genuinely  malevolent.  Worse  means  that  naive  beliefs  can  become  a  positive 
invitation  to  abuse,  because  those  who  aim  to  harm  have  become  specialized  to 
prey  on  people  who  think  precisely  such  things.  Under  such  conditions,  the 
axioms  of  harmlessness  must  be  retooled.  In  my  clinical  practice  I  often  draw  the 
attention  of  my  clients  who  think  that  good  people  never  become  angry  to  the 
stark  realities  of  their  own  resentments. 

No  one  likes  to  be  pushed  around,  but  people  often  put  up  with  it  for  too  long. 
So,  I  get  them  to  see  their  resentment,  first,  as  anger,  and  then  as  an  indication 
that  something  needs  to  be  said,  if  not  done  (not  least  because  honesty  demands 
it).  Then  I  get  them  to  see  such  action  as  part  of  the  force  that  holds  tyranny  at 
bay — at  the  social  level,  as  much  as  the  individual.  Many  bureaucracies  have 
petty  authoritarians  within  them,  generating  unnecessary  rules  and  procedures 
simply  to  express  and  cement  power.  Such  people  produce  powerful 
undercurrents  of  resentment  around  them  which,  if  expressed,  would  limit  their 
expression  of  pathological  power.  It  is  in  this  manner  that  the  willingness  of  the 
individual  to  stand  up  for  him  or  herself  protects  everyone  from  the  corruption  of 
society. 

When  naive  people  discover  the  capacity  for  anger  within  themselves,  they  are 
shocked,  sometimes  severely.  A  profound  example  of  that  can  be  found  in  the 


susceptibility  of  new  soldiers  to  post-traumatic  stress  disorder,  which  often 
occurs  because  of  something  they  watch  themselves  doing,  rather  than  because 
of  something  that  has  happened  to  them.  They  react  like  the  monsters  they  can 
truly  be  in  extreme  battlefield  conditions,  and  the  revelation  of  that  capacity 
undoes  their  world.  And  no  wonder.  Perhaps  they  assumed  that  all  of  history’s 
terrible  perpetrators  were  people  totally  unlike  themselves.  Perhaps  they  were 
never  able  to  see  within  themselves  the  capacity  for  oppression  and  bullying 
(and  perhaps  not  their  capacity  for  assertion  and  success,  as  well).  I  have  had 
clients  who  were  terrified  into  literally  years  of  daily  hysterical  convulsions  by 
the  sheer  look  of  malevolence  on  their  attackers’  faces.  Such  individuals 
typically  come  from  hyper-sheltered  families,  where  nothing  terrible  is  allowed 
to  exist,  and  everything  is  fairyland  wonderful  (or  else). 

When  the  wakening  occurs — when  once-naive  people  recognize  in  themselves 
the  seeds  of  evil  and  monstrosity,  and  see  themselves  as  dangerous  (at  least 
potentially)  their  fear  decreases.  They  develop  more  self-respect.  Then,  perhaps, 
they  begin  to  resist  oppression.  They  see  that  they  have  the  ability  to  withstand, 
because  they  are  terrible  too.  They  see  they  can  and  must  stand  up,  because  they 
begin  to  understand  how  genuinely  monstrous  they  will  become,  otherwise, 
feeding  on  their  resentment,  transforming  it  into  the  most  destructive  of  wishes. 
To  say  it  again:  There  is  very  little  difference  between  the  capacity  for  mayhem 
and  destruction,  integrated,  and  strength  of  character.  This  is  one  of  the  most 
difficult  lessons  of  life. 

Maybe  you  are  a  loser.  And  maybe  you’re  not — but  if  you  are,  you  don’t  have 
to  continue  in  that  mode.  Maybe  you  just  have  a  bad  habit.  Maybe  you’re  even 
just  a  collection  of  bad  habits.  Nonetheless,  even  if  you  came  by  your  poor 
posture  honestly — even  if  you  were  unpopular  or  bullied  at  home  or  in  grade 
school  — it’s  not  necessarily  appropriate  now.  Circumstances  change.  If  you 
slump  around,  with  the  same  bearing  that  characterizes  a  defeated  lobster,  people 
will  assign  you  a  lower  status,  and  the  old  counter  that  you  share  with 
crustaceans,  sitting  at  the  very  base  of  your  brain,  will  assign  you  a  low 
dominance  number.  Then  your  brain  will  not  produce  as  much  serotonin.  This 
will  make  you  less  happy,  and  more  anxious  and  sad,  and  more  likely  to  back 
down  when  you  should  stand  up  for  yourself.  It  will  also  decrease  the  probability 
that  you  will  get  to  live  in  a  good  neighbourhood,  have  access  to  the  highest 
quality  resources,  and  obtain  a  healthy,  desirable  mate.  It  will  render  you  more 
likely  to  abuse  cocaine  and  alcohol,  as  you  live  for  the  present  in  a  world  full  of 
uncertain  futures.  It  will  increase  your  susceptibility  to  heart  disease,  cancer  and 
dementia.  All  in  all,  it’s  just  not  good. 

Circumstances  change,  and  so  can  you.  Positive  feedback  loops,  adding  effect 


to  effect,  can  spiral  counterproductively  in  a  negative  direction,  but  can  also 
work  to  get  you  ahead.  That’s  the  other,  far  more  optimistic  lesson  of  Price’s  law 
and  the  Pareto  distribution:  those  who  start  to  have  will  probably  get  more.  Some 
of  these  upwardly  moving  loops  can  occur  in  your  own  private,  subjective  space. 
Alterations  in  body  language  offer  an  important  example.  If  you  are  asked  by  a 
researcher  to  move  your  facial  muscles,  one  at  a  time,  into  a  position  that  would 
look  sad  to  an  observer,  you  will  report  feeling  sadder.  If  you  are  asked  to  move 
the  muscles  one  by  one  into  a  position  that  looks  happy,  you  will  report  feeling 
happier.  Emotion  is  partly  bodily  expression,  and  can  be  amplified  (or 
dampened)  by  that  expression. 

Some  of  the  positive  feedback  loops  instantiated  by  body  language  can  occur 
beyond  the  private  confines  of  subjective  experience,  in  the  social  space  you 
share  with  other  people.  If  your  posture  is  poor,  for  example — if  you  slump, 
shoulders  forward  and  rounded,  chest  tucked  in,  head  down,  looking  small, 
defeated  and  ineffectual  (protected,  in  theory,  against  attack  from  behind) — then 
you  will  feel  small,  defeated  and  ineffectual.  The  reactions  of  others  will  amplify 
that.  People,  like  lobsters,  size  each  other  up,  partly  in  consequence  of  stance.  If 
you  present  yourself  as  defeated,  then  people  will  react  to  you  as  if  you  are 
losing.  If  you  start  to  straighten  up,  then  people  will  look  at  and  treat  you 
differently. 

You  might  object:  the  bottom  is  real.  Being  at  the  bottom  is  equally  real.  A 
mere  transformation  of  posture  is  insufficient  to  change  anything  that  fixed.  If 
you’re  in  number  ten  position,  then  standing  up  straight  and  appearing  dominant 
might  only  attract  the  attention  of  those  who  want,  once  again,  to  put  you  down. 
And  fair  enough.  But  standing  up  straight  with  your  shoulders  back  is  not 
something  that  is  only  physical,  because  you’re  not  only  a  body.  You’re  a  spirit, 
so  to  speak — a  psyche — as  well.  Standing  up  physically  also  implies  and  invokes 
and  demands  standing  up  metaphysically.  Standing  up  means  voluntarily 
accepting  the  burden  of  Being.  Your  nervous  system  responds  in  an  entirely 
different  manner  when  you  face  the  demands  of  life  voluntarily.  You  respond  to 
a  challenge,  instead  of  bracing  for  a  catastrophe.  You  see  the  gold  the  dragon 
hoards,  instead  of  shrinking  in  terror  from  the  all-too-real  fact  of  the  dragon.  You 
step  forward  to  take  your  place  in  the  dominance  hierarchy,  and  occupy  your 
territory,  manifesting  your  willingness  to  defend,  expand  and  transform  it.  That 
can  all  occur  practically  or  symbolically,  as  a  physical  or  as  a  conceptual 
restructuring. 

To  stand  up  straight  with  your  shoulders  back  is  to  accept  the  terrible 
responsibility  of  life,  with  eyes  wide  open.  It  means  deciding  to  voluntarily 
transform  the  chaos  of  potential  into  the  realities  of  habitable  order.  It  means 


adopting  the  burden  of  self-conscious  vulnerability,  and  accepting  the  end  of  the 
unconscious  paradise  of  childhood,  where  finitude  and  mortality  are  only  dimly 
comprehended.  It  means  willingly  undertaking  the  sacrifices  necessary  to 
generate  a  productive  and  meaningful  reality  (it  means  acting  to  please  God,  in 
the  ancient  language). 

To  stand  up  straight  with  your  shoulders  back  means  building  the  ark  that 
protects  the  world  from  the  flood,  guiding  your  people  through  the  desert  after 
they  have  escaped  tyranny,  making  your  way  away  from  comfortable  home  and 
country,  and  speaking  the  prophetic  word  to  those  who  ignore  the  widows  and 
children.  It  means  shouldering  the  cross  that  marks  the  X,  the  place  where  you 
and  Being  intersect  so  terribly.  It  means  casting  dead,  rigid  and  too  tyrannical 
order  back  into  the  chaos  in  which  it  was  generated;  it  means  withstanding  the 
ensuing  uncertainty,  and  establishing,  in  consequence,  a  better,  more  meaningful 
and  more  productive  order. 

So,  attend  carefully  to  your  posture.  Quit  drooping  and  hunching  around. 
Speak  your  mind.  Put  your  desires  forward,  as  if  you  had  a  right  to  them — at 
least  the  same  right  as  others.  Walk  tall  and  gaze  forthrightly  ahead.  Dare  to  be 
dangerous.  Encourage  the  serotonin  to  flow  plentifully  through  the  neural 
pathways  desperate  for  its  calming  influence. 

People,  including  yourself,  will  start  to  assume  that  you  are  competent  and 
able  (or  at  least  they  will  not  immediately  conclude  the  reverse).  Emboldened  by 
the  positive  responses  you  are  now  receiving,  you  will  begin  to  be  less  anxious. 
You  will  then  find  it  easier  to  pay  attention  to  the  subtle  social  clues  that  people 
exchange  when  they  are  communicating.  Your  conversations  will  flow  better, 
with  fewer  awkward  pauses.  This  will  make  you  more  likely  to  meet  people, 
interact  with  them,  and  impress  them.  Doing  so  will  not  only  genuinely  increase 
the  probability  that  good  things  will  happen  to  you — it  will  also  make  those 
good  things  feel  better  when  they  do  happen. 

Thus  strengthened  and  emboldened,  you  may  choose  to  embrace  Being,  and 
work  for  its  furtherance  and  improvement.  Thus  strengthened,  you  may  be  able 
to  stand,  even  during  the  illness  of  a  loved  one,  even  during  the  death  of  a 
parent,  and  allow  others  to  find  strength  alongside  you  when  they  would 
otherwise  be  overwhelmed  with  despair.  Thus  emboldened,  you  will  embark  on 
the  voyage  of  your  life,  let  your  light  shine,  so  to  speak,  on  the  heavenly  hill,  and 
pursue  your  rightful  destiny.  Then  the  meaning  of  your  life  may  be  sufficient  to 
keep  the  corrupting  influence  of  mortal  despair  at  bay. 

Then  you  may  be  able  to  accept  the  terrible  burden  of  the  World,  and  find  joy. 

Look  for  your  inspiration  to  the  victorious  lobster,  with  its  350  million  years 
of  practical  wisdom.  Stand  up  straight,  with  your  shoulders  back. 


RULE  2 


TREAT  YOURSELF  LIKE  SOMEONE  YOU  ARE 
RESPONSIBLE  FOR  HELPING 

WHY  WON’T  YOU  JUST  TAKE  YOUR  DAMN  PILLS? 

Imagine  that  a  hundred  people  are  prescribed  a  drug.  Consider  what  happens 
next.  One-third  of  them  won’t  fill  the  prescription.  Half  of  the  remaining  sixty- 
seven  will  fill  it,  but  won’t  take  the  medication  correctly.  They’ll  miss  doses. 
They’ll  quit  taking  it  early.  They  might  not  even  take  it  at  all. 

Physicians  and  pharmacists  tend  to  blame  such  patients  for  their 
noncompliance,  inaction  and  error.  You  can  lead  a  horse  to  water,  they  reason. 
Psychologists  tend  to  take  a  dim  view  of  such  judgments.  We  are  trained  to 
assume  that  the  failure  of  patients  to  follow  professional  advice  is  the  fault  of  the 
practitioner,  not  the  patient.  We  believe  the  health-care  provider  has  a 
responsibility  to  profer  advice  that  will  be  followed,  offer  interventions  that  will 
be  respected,  plan  with  the  patient  or  client  until  the  desired  result  is  achieved, 
and  follow  up  to  ensure  that  everything  is  going  correctly.  This  is  just  one  of  the 
many  things  that  make  psychologists  so  wonderful  -  :).  Of  course,  we  have  the 
luxury  of  time  with  our  clients,  unlike  other  more  beleaguered  professionals, 
who  wonder  why  sick  people  won’t  take  their  medication.  What’s  wrong  with 
them?  Don’t  they  want  to  get  better? 

Here’s  something  worse.  Imagine  that  someone  receives  an  organ  transplant. 
Imagine  it’s  a  kidney.  A  transplant  typically  occurs  only  after  a  long  period  of 
anxious  waiting  on  the  part  of  the  recipient.  Only  a  minority  of  people  donate 
organs  when  they  die  (and  even  fewer  when  they  are  still  alive).  Only  a  small 
number  of  donated  organs  are  a  good  match  for  any  hopeful  recipient.  This 
means  that  the  typical  kidney  transplantee  has  been  undergoing  dialysis,  the  only 
alternative,  for  years.  Dialysis  involves  passing  all  the  patient’s  blood  out  of  his 
or  her  body,  through  a  machine,  and  back  in.  It  is  an  unlikely  and  miraculous 
treatment,  so  that’s  all  good,  but  it’s  not  pleasant.  It  must  happen  five  to  seven 
times  a  week,  for  eight  hours  a  time.  It  should  happen  every  time  the  patient 
sleeps.  That’s  too  much.  No  one  wants  to  stay  on  dialysis. 

Now,  one  of  the  complications  of  transplantation  is  rejection.  Your  body  does 
not  like  it  when  parts  of  someone  else’s  body  are  stitched  into  it.  Your  immune 
system  will  attack  and  destroy  such  foreign  elements,  even  when  they  are  crucial 
to  your  survival.  To  stop  this  from  happening,  you  must  take  anti-rejection  drugs, 


which  weaken  immunity,  increasing  your  susceptibility  to  infectious  disease. 
Most  people  are  happy  to  accept  the  trade-off.  Recipients  of  transplants  still 
suffer  the  effects  of  organ  rejection,  despite  the  existence  and  utility  of  these 
drugs.  It’s  not  because  the  drugs  fail  (although  they  sometimes  do).  It’s  more 
often  because  those  prescribed  the  drugs  do  not  take  them.  This  beggars  belief.  It 
is  seriously  not  good  to  have  your  kidneys  fail.  Dialysis  is  no  picnic. 
Transplantation  surgery  occurs  after  long  waiting,  at  high  risk  and  great  expense. 
To  lose  all  that  because  you  don’t  take  your  medication?  How  could  people  do 
that  to  themselves?  How  could  this  possibly  be? 

It’s  complicated,  to  be  fair.  Many  people  who  receive  a  transplanted  organ  are 
isolated,  or  beset  by  multiple  physical  health  problems  (to  say  nothing  of 
problems  associated  with  unemployment  or  family  crisis).  They  may  be 
cognitively  impaired  or  depressed.  They  may  not  entirely  trust  their  doctor,  or 
understand  the  necessity  of  the  medication.  Maybe  they  can  barely  afford  the 
dmgs,  and  ration  them,  desperately  and  unproductively. 

But — and  this  is  the  amazing  thing — imagine  that  it  isn’t  you  who  feels  sick. 
It’s  your  dog.  So,  you  take  him  to  the  vet.  The  vet  gives  you  a  prescription.  What 
happens  then?  You  have  just  as  many  reasons  to  distrust  a  vet  as  a  doctor. 
Furthermore,  if  you  cared  so  little  for  your  pet  that  you  weren’t  concerned  with 
what  improper,  substandard  or  error-ridden  prescription  he  might  be  given,  you 
wouldn’t  have  taken  him  to  the  vet  in  the  first  place.  Thus,  you  care.  Your 
actions  prove  it.  In  fact,  on  average,  you  care  more.  People  are  better  at  filling 
and  properly  administering  prescription  medication  to  their  pets  than  to 
themselves.  That’s  not  good.  Even  from  your  pet’s  perspective,  it’s  not  good. 
Your  pet  (probably)  loves  you,  and  would  be  happier  if  you  took  your 
medication. 

It  is  difficult  to  conclude  anything  from  this  set  of  facts  except  that  people 
appear  to  love  their  dogs,  cats,  ferrets  and  birds  (and  maybe  even  their  lizards) 
more  than  themselves.  How  horrible  is  that?  How  much  shame  must  exist,  for 
something  like  that  to  be  true?  What  could  it  be  about  people  that  makes  them 
prefer  their  pets  to  themselves? 

It  was  an  ancient  story  in  the  Book  of  Genesis — the  first  book  in  the  Old 
Testament — that  helped  me  find  an  answer  to  that  perplexing  question. 

The  Oldest  Story  and  the  Nature  of  the  World 

Two  stories  of  Creation  from  two  different  Middle  Eastern  sources  appear  to  be 
woven  together  in  the  Genesis  account.  In  the  chronologically  first  but 
historically  more  recent  account — known  as  the  “Priestly” — God  created  the 


cosmos,  using  His  divine  Word,  speaking  light,  water  and  land  into  existence, 
following  that  with  the  plants  and  the  heavenly  bodies.  Then  He  created  birds 
and  animals  and  fish  (again,  employing  speech) — and  ended  with  man,  male  and 
female,  both  somehow  formed  in  his  image.  That  all  happens  in  Genesis  1.  In  the 
second,  older,  “Jawhist”  version,  we  find  another  origin  account,  involving 
Adam  and  Eve  (where  the  details  of  creation  differ  somewhat),  as  well  as  the 
stories  of  Cain  and  Abel,  Noah  and  the  Tower  of  Babel.  That  is  Genesis  2  to  11. 
To  understand  Genesis  1,  the  Priestly  story,  with  its  insistence  on  speech  as  the 
fundamental  creative  force,  it  is  first  necessary  to  review  a  few  fundamental, 
ancient  assumptions  (these  are  markedly  different  in  type  and  intent  from  the 
assumptions  of  science,  which  are,  historically  speaking,  quite  novel). 

Scientific  truths  were  made  explicit  a  mere  five  hundred  years  ago,  with  the 
work  of  Francis  Bacon,  Rene  Descartes  and  Isaac  Newton.  In  whatever  manner 
our  forebears  viewed  the  world  prior  to  that,  it  was  not  through  a  scientific  lens 
(any  more  than  they  could  view  the  moon  and  the  stars  through  the  glass  lenses 
of  the  equally  recent  telescope).  Because  we  are  so  scientific  now — and  so 
determinedly  materialistic — it  is  very  difficult  for  us  even  to  understand  that 
other  ways  of  seeing  can  and  do  exist.  But  those  who  existed  during  the  distant 
time  in  which  the  foundational  epics  of  our  culture  emerged  were  much  more 
concerned  with  the  actions  that  dictated  survival  (and  with  interpreting  the  world 
in  a  manner  commensurate  with  that  goal)  than  with  anything  approximating 
what  we  now  understand  as  objective  truth. 

Before  the  dawn  of  the  scientific  worldview,  reality  was  construed  differently. 
Being  was  understood  as  a  place  of  action,  not  a  place  of  things.  It  was 
understood  as  something  more  akin  to  story  or  drama.  That  story  or  drama  was 
lived,  subjective  experience,  as  it  manifested  itself  moment  to  moment  in  the 
consciousness  of  every  living  person.  It  was  something  similar  to  the  stories  we 
tell  each  other  about  our  lives  and  their  personal  significance;  something  similar 
to  the  happenings  that  novelists  describe  when  they  capture  existence  in  the 
pages  of  their  books.  Subjective  experience — that  includes  familiar  objects  such 
as  trees  and  clouds,  primarily  objective  in  their  existence,  but  also  (and  more 
importantly)  such  things  as  emotions  and  dreams  as  well  as  hunger,  thirst  and 
pain.  It  is  such  things,  experienced  personally,  that  are  the  most  fundamental 
elements  of  human  life,  from  the  archaic,  dramatic  perspective,  and  they  are  not 
easily  reducible  to  the  detached  and  objective — even  by  the  modern  reductionist, 
materialist  mind.  Take  pain,  for  example — subjective  pain.  That’s  something  so 
real  no  argument  can  stand  against  it.  Everyone  acts  as  if  their  pain  is  real — 
ultimately,  finally  real.  Pain  matters,  more  than  matter  matters.  It  is  for  this 


reason,  I  believe,  that  so  many  of  the  world’s  traditions  regard  the  suffering 
attendant  upon  existence  as  the  irreducible  truth  of  Being. 

In  any  case,  that  which  we  subjectively  experience  can  be  likened  much  more 
to  a  novel  or  a  movie  than  to  a  scientific  description  of  physical  reality.  It  is  the 
drama  of  lived  experience — the  unique,  tragic,  personal  death  of  your  father, 
compared  to  the  objective  death  listed  in  the  hospital  records;  the  pain  of  your 
first  love;  the  despair  of  dashed  hopes;  the  joy  attendant  upon  a  child’s  success. 

The  Domain,  Not  of  Matter,  but  of  What  Matters 

The  scientific  world  of  matter  can  be  reduced,  in  some  sense,  to  its  fundamental 
constituent  elements:  molecules,  atoms,  even  quarks.  However,  the  world  of 
experience  has  primal  constituents,  as  well.  These  are  the  necessary  elements 
whose  interactions  define  drama  and  fiction.  One  of  these  is  chaos.  Another  is 
order.  The  third  (as  there  are  three)  is  the  process  that  mediates  between  the  two, 
which  appears  identical  to  what  modern  people  call  consciousness.  It  is  our 
eternal  subjugation  to  the  first  two  that  makes  us  doubt  the  validity  of  existence 
— that  makes  us  throw  up  our  hands  in  despair,  and  fail  to  care  for  ourselves 
properly.  It  is  proper  understanding  of  the  third  that  allows  us  the  only  real  way 
out. 

Chaos  is  the  domain  of  ignorance  itself.  It’s  unexplored  territory.  Chaos  is 
what  extends,  eternally  and  without  limit,  beyond  the  boundaries  of  all  states,  all 
ideas,  and  all  disciplines.  It’s  the  foreigner,  the  stranger,  the  member  of  another 
gang,  the  rustle  in  the  bushes  in  the  night-time,  the  monster  under  the  bed,  the 
hidden  anger  of  your  mother,  and  the  sickness  of  your  child.  Chaos  is  the  despair 
and  horror  you  feel  when  you  have  been  profoundly  betrayed.  It’s  the  place  you 
end  up  when  things  fall  apart;  when  your  dreams  die,  your  career  collapses,  or 
your  marriage  ends.  It’s  the  underworld  of  fairytale  and  myth,  where  the  dragon 
and  the  gold  it  guards  eternally  co-exist.  Chaos  is  where  we  are  when  we  don’t 
know  where  we  are,  and  what  we  are  doing  when  we  don’t  know  what  we  are 
doing.  It  is,  in  short,  all  those  things  and  situations  we  neither  know  nor 
understand. 

Chaos  is  also  the  formless  potential  from  which  the  God  of  Genesis  1  called 
forth  order  using  language  at  the  beginning  of  time.  It’s  the  same  potential  from 
which  we,  made  in  that  Image,  call  forth  the  novel  and  ever-changing  moments 
of  our  lives.  And  Chaos  is  freedom,  dreadful  freedom,  too. 

Order,  by  contrast,  is  explored  territory.  That’s  the  hundreds-of-millions-of- 
years-old  hierarchy  of  place,  position  and  authority.  That’s  the  structure  of 
society.  It’s  the  structure  provided  by  biology,  too — particularly  insofar  as  you 


are  adapted,  as  you  are,  to  the  structure  of  society.  Order  is  tribe,  religion,  hearth, 
home  and  country.  It’s  the  warm,  secure  living-room  where  the  fireplace  glows 
and  the  children  play.  It’s  the  flag  of  the  nation.  It’s  the  value  of  the  currency. 
Order  is  the  floor  beneath  your  feet,  and  your  plan  for  the  day.  It’s  the  greatness 
of  tradition,  the  rows  of  desks  in  a  school  classroom,  the  trains  that  leave  on 
time,  the  calendar,  and  the  clock.  Order  is  the  public  facade  we’re  called  upon  to 
wear,  the  politeness  of  a  gathering  of  civilized  strangers,  and  the  thin  ice  on 
which  we  all  skate.  Order  is  the  place  where  the  behavior  of  the  world  matches 
our  expectations  and  our  desires;  the  place  where  all  things  turn  out  the  way  we 
want  them  to.  But  order  is  sometimes  tyranny  and  stultification,  as  well,  when 
the  demand  for  certainty  and  uniformity  and  purity  becomes  too  one-sided. 

Where  everything  is  certain,  we’re  in  order.  We’re  there  when  things  are  going 
according  to  plan  and  nothing  is  new  and  disturbing.  In  the  domain  of  order, 
things  behave  as  God  intended.  We  like  to  be  there.  Familiar  environments  are 
congenial.  In  order,  we’re  able  to  think  about  things  in  the  long  term.  There, 
things  work,  and  we’re  stable,  calm  and  competent.  We  seldom  leave  places  we 
understand — geographical  or  conceptual — for  that  reason,  and  we  certainly  do 
not  like  it  when  we  are  compelled  to  or  when  it  happens  accidentally. 

You’re  in  order,  when  you  have  a  loyal  friend,  a  trustworthy  ally.  When  the 
same  person  betrays  you,  sells  you  out,  you  move  from  the  daytime  world  of 
clarity  and  light  to  the  dark  underworld  of  chaos,  confusion  and  despair.  That’s 
the  same  move  you  make,  and  the  same  place  you  visit,  when  the  company  you 
work  starts  to  fail  and  your  job  is  placed  in  doubt.  When  your  tax  return  has  been 
filed,  that’s  order.  When  you’re  audited,  that’s  chaos.  Most  people  would  rather 
be  mugged  than  audited.  Before  the  Twin  Towers  fell — that  was  order.  Chaos 
manifested  itself  afterward.  Everyone  felt  it.  The  very  air  became  uncertain. 

What  exactly  was  it  that  fell?  Wrong  question.  What  exactly  remained  standing? 
That  was  the  issue  at  hand. 

When  the  ice  you’re  skating  on  is  solid,  that’s  order.  When  the  bottom  drops 
out,  and  things  fall  apart,  and  you  plunge  through  the  ice,  that’s  chaos.  Order  is 
the  Shire  of  Tolkien’s  hobbits:  peaceful,  productive  and  safely  inhabitable,  even 
by  the  naive.  Chaos  is  the  underground  kingdom  of  the  dwarves,  usurped  by 
Smaug,  the  treasure-hoarding  serpent.  Chaos  is  the  deep  ocean  bottom  to  which 
Pinocchio  voyaged  to  rescue  his  father  from  Monstro,  whale  and  fire-breathing 
dragon.  That  journey  into  darkness  and  rescue  is  the  most  difficult  thing  a  puppet 
must  do,  if  he  wants  to  be  real;  if  he  wants  to  extract  himself  from  the 
temptations  of  deceit  and  acting  and  victimization  and  impulsive  pleasure  and 
totalitarian  subjugation;  if  he  wants  to  take  his  place  as  a  genuine  Being  in  the 
world. 


Order  is  the  stability  of  your  marriage.  It’s  buttressed  by  the  traditions  of  the 
past  and  by  your  expectations — grounded,  often  invisibly,  in  those  traditions. 
Chaos  is  that  stability  crumbling  under  your  feet  when  you  discover  your 
partner’s  infidelity.  Chaos  is  the  experience  of  reeling  unbound  and  unsupported 
through  space  when  your  guiding  routines  and  traditions  collapse. 

Order  is  the  place  and  time  where  the  oft-invisible  axioms  you  live  by 
organize  your  experience  and  your  actions  so  that  what  should  happen  does 
happen.  Chaos  is  the  new  place  and  time  that  emerges  when  tragedy  strikes 
suddenly,  or  malevolence  reveals  its  paralyzing  visage,  even  in  the  confines  of 
your  own  home.  Something  unexpected  or  undesired  can  always  make  its 
appearance,  when  a  plan  is  being  laid  out,  regardless  of  how  familiar  the 
circumstances.  When  that  happens,  the  territory  has  shifted.  Make  no  mistake 
about  it:  the  space,  the  apparent  space,  may  be  the  same.  But  we  live  in  time,  as 
well  as  space.  In  consequence,  even  the  oldest  and  most  familiar  places  retain  an 
ineradicable  capacity  to  surprise  you.  You  may  be  cruising  happily  down  the 
road  in  the  automobile  you  have  known  and  loved  for  years.  But  time  is  passing. 
The  brakes  could  fail.  You  might  be  walking  down  the  road  in  the  body  you  have 
always  relied  on.  If  your  heart  malfunctions,  even  momentarily,  everything 
changes.  Friendly  old  dogs  can  still  bite.  Old  and  trusted  friends  can  still 
deceive.  New  ideas  can  destroy  old  and  comfortable  certainties.  Such  things 
matter.  They’re  real. 

Our  brains  respond  instantly  when  chaos  appears,  with  simple,  hyper-fast 
circuits  maintained  from  the  ancient  days,  when  our  ancestors  dwelled  in  trees, 
and  snakes  struck  in  a  flash.  After  that  nigh-instantaneous,  deeply  reflexive 
bodily  response  comes  the  later-evolving,  more  complex  but  slower  responses  of 
emotions — and,  after  that,  comes  thinking,  of  the  higher  order,  which  can  extend 
over  seconds,  minutes  or  years.  All  that  response  is  instinctive,  in  some  sense — 
but  the  faster  the  response,  the  more  instinctive. 

Chaos  and  Order:  Personality,  Female  and  Male 

Chaos  and  order  are  two  of  the  most  fundamental  elements  of  lived  experience — 
two  of  the  most  basic  subdivisions  of  Being  itself.  But  they’re  not  things,  or 
objects,  and  they’re  not  experienced  as  such.  Things  or  objects  are  part  of  the 
objective  world.  They’re  inanimate;  spiritless.  They’re  dead.  This  is  not  true  of 
chaos  and  order.  Those  are  perceived,  experienced  and  understood  (to  the  degree 
that  they  are  understood  at  all)  as  personalities — and  that  is  just  as  true  of  the 
perceptions,  experiences  and  understanding  of  modern  people  as  their  ancient 
forebears.  It’s  just  that  moderners  don’t  notice. 


Order  and  chaos  are  not  understood  first,  objectively  (as  things  or  objects), 
and  then  personified.  That  would  only  be  the  case  if  we  perceived  objective 
reality  first,  and  then  inferred  intent  and  purpose.  But  that  isn’t  how  perception 
operates,  despite  our  preconceptions.  Perception  of  things  as  tools,  for  example, 
occurs  before  or  in  concert  with  perception  of  things  as  objects.  We  see  what 
things  mean  just  as  fast  or  faster  than  we  see  what  they  are.  Perception  of 
things  as  entities  with  personality  also  occurs  before  perception  of  things  as 
things.  This  is  particularly  true  of  the  action  of  others,  living  others,  but  we 
also  see  the  non-living  “objective  world”  as  animated,  with  purpose  and  intent. 
This  is  because  of  the  operation  of  what  psychologists  have  called  “the 
hyperactive  agency  detector”  within  us.  We  evolved,  over  millennia,  within 
intensely  social  circumstances.  This  means  that  the  most  significant  elements  of 
our  environment  of  origin  were  personalities,  not  things,  objects  or  situations. 

The  personalities  we  have  evolved  to  perceive  have  been  around,  in 
predictable  form,  and  in  typical,  hierarchical  configurations,  forever,  for  all 
intents  and  purposes.  They  have  been  male  or  female,  for  example,  for  a  billion 
years.  That’s  a  long  time.  The  division  of  life  into  its  twin  sexes  occurred  before 
the  evolution  of  multi-cellular  animals.  It  was  in  a  still-respectable  one-fifth  of 
that  time  that  mammals,  who  take  extensive  care  of  their  young,  emerged.  Thus, 
the  category  of  “parent”  and/or  “child”  has  been  around  for  200  million  years. 
That’s  longer  than  birds  have  existed.  That’s  longer  than  flowers  have  grown.  It’s 
not  a  billion  years,  but  it’s  still  a  very  long  time.  It’s  plenty  long  enough  for  male 
and  female  and  parent  and  child  to  serve  as  vital  and  fundamental  parts  of  the 
environment  to  which  we  have  adapted.  This  means  that  male  and  female  and 
parent  and  child  are  categories,  for  us — natural  categories,  deeply  embedded  in 
our  perceptual,  emotional  and  motivational  structures. 

Our  brains  are  deeply  social.  Other  creatures  (particularly,  other  humans)  were 
crucially  important  to  us  as  we  lived,  mated  and  evolved.  Those  creatures  were 
literally  our  natural  habitat — our  environment.  From  a  Darwinian  perspective, 
nature — reality  itself;  the  environment,  itself — is  what  selects.  The  environment 
cannot  be  defined  in  any  more  fundamental  manner.  It  is  not  mere  inert  matter. 
Reality  itself  is  whatever  we  contend  with  when  we  are  striving  to  survive  and 
reproduce.  A  lot  of  that  is  other  beings,  their  opinions  of  us,  and  their 
communities.  And  that’s  that. 

Over  the  millennia,  as  our  brain  capacity  increased  and  we  developed 
curiosity  to  spare,  we  became  increasingly  aware  of  and  curious  about  the  nature 
of  the  world — what  we  eventually  conceptualized  as  the  objective  world — 
outside  the  personalities  of  family  and  troupe.  And  “outside”  is  not  merely 


unexplored  physical  territory.  Outside  is  outside  of  what  we  currently  understand 
— and  understanding  is  dealing  with  and  coping  with  and  not  merely 
representing  objectively.  But  our  brains  had  been  long  concentrating  on  other 
people.  Thus,  it  appears  that  we  first  began  to  perceive  the  unknown,  chaotic, 
non-human  world  with  the  innate  categories  of  our  social  brain.  And  even  this 
is  a  misstatement:  when  we  first  began  to  perceive  the  unknown,  chaotic,  non¬ 
animal  world,  we  used  categories  that  had  originally  evolved  to  represent  the 
pre-human  animal  social  world.  Our  minds  are  far  older  than  mere  humanity. 

Our  categories  are  far  older  than  our  species.  Our  most  basic  category — as  old, 
in  some  sense,  as  the  sexual  act  itself — appears  to  be  that  of  sex,  male  and 
female.  We  appear  to  have  taken  that  primordial  knowledge  of  structured, 
creative  opposition  and  begun  to  interpret  everything  through  its  lens. 

Order,  the  known,  appears  symbolically  associated  with  masculinity  (as 
illustrated  in  the  aforementioned  yang  of  the  Taoist  yin-yang  symbol).  This  is 
perhaps  because  the  primary  hierarchical  structure  of  human  society  is 
masculine,  as  it  is  among  most  animals,  including  the  chimpanzees  who  are  our 
closest  genetic  and,  arguably,  behavioural  match.  It  is  because  men  are  and 
throughout  history  have  been  the  builders  of  towns  and  cities,  the  engineers, 
stonemasons,  bricklayers,  and  lumberjacks,  the  operators  of  heavy  machinery. 
Order  is  God  the  Father,  the  eternal  Judge,  ledger-keeper  and  dispenser  of 
rewards  and  punishments.  Order  is  the  peacetime  army  of  policemen  and 
soldiers.  It’s  the  political  culture,  the  corporate  environment,  and  the  system.  It’s 
the  “they”  in  “you  know  what  they  say.”  It’s  credit  cards,  classrooms, 
supermarket  checkout  lineups,  turn-taking,  traffic  lights,  and  the  familiar  routes 
of  daily  commuters.  Order,  when  pushed  too  far,  when  imbalanced,  can  also 
manifest  itself  destructively  and  terribly.  It  does  so  as  the  forced  migration,  the 
concentration  camp,  and  the  soul-devouring  uniformity  of  the  goose-step. 

Chaos — the  unknown — is  symbolically  associated  with  the  feminine.  This  is 
partly  because  all  the  things  we  have  come  to  know  were  born,  originally,  of  the 
unknown,  just  as  all  beings  we  encounter  were  born  of  mothers.  Chaos  is  mater, 
origin,  source,  mother;  materia,  the  substance  from  which  all  things  are  made.  It 
is  also  what  matters,  or  what  is  the  matter — the  very  subject  matter  of  thought 
and  communication.  In  its  positive  guise,  chaos  is  possibility  itself,  the  source  of 
ideas,  the  mysterious  realm  of  gestation  and  birth.  As  a  negative  force,  it’s  the 
impenetrable  darkness  of  a  cave  and  the  accident  by  the  side  of  the  road.  It’s  the 
mother  grizzly,  all  compassion  to  her  cubs,  who  marks  you  as  potential  predator 
and  tears  you  to  pieces. 


Chaos,  the  eternal  feminine,  is  also  the  crushing  force  of  sexual  selection. 
Women  are  choosy  maters  (unlike  female  chimps,  their  closest  animal 
counterparts  ).  Most  men  do  not  meet  female  human  standards.  It  is  for  this 
reason  that  women  on  dating  sites  rate  85  percent  of  men  as  below  average  in 
attractiveness.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  we  all  have  twice  as  many  female 
ancestors  as  male  (imagine  that  all  the  women  who  have  ever  lived  have 
averaged  one  child.  Now  imagine  that  half  the  men  who  have  ever  lived  have 
fathered  two  children,  if  they  had  any,  while  the  other  half  fathered  none).  It  is 
Woman  as  Nature  who  looks  at  half  of  all  men  and  says,  “No!”  For  the  men, 
that’s  a  direct  encounter  with  chaos,  and  it  occurs  with  devastating  force  every 
time  they  are  turned  down  for  a  date.  Human  female  choosiness  is  also  why  we 
are  very  different  from  the  common  ancestor  we  shared  with  our  chimpanzee 
cousins,  while  the  latter  are  very  much  the  same.  Women’s  proclivity  to  say  no, 
more  than  any  other  force,  has  shaped  our  evolution  into  the  creative, 
industrious,  upright,  large-brained  (competitive,  aggressive,  domineering) 
creatures  that  we  are.  It  is  Nature  as  Woman  who  says,  “Well,  bucko,  you’re 
good  enough  for  a  friend,  but  my  experience  of  you  so  far  has  not  indicated  the 
suitability  of  your  genetic  material  for  continued  propagation.” 

The  most  profound  religious  symbols  rely  for  their  power  in  large  part  on  this 
underlying  fundamentally  bipartisan  conceptual  subdivision.  The  Star  of  David 
is,  for  example,  the  downward  pointing  triangle  of  femininity  and  the  upward 
pointing  triangle  of  the  male. fnl  It’s  the  same  for  the  yoni  and  lingam  of 
Hinduism  (which  come  covered  with  snakes,  our  ancient  adversaries  and 
provocateurs:  the  Shiva  Linga  is  depicted  with  snake  deities  called  the  Nagas). 
The  ancient  Egyptians  represented  Osiris,  god  of  the  state,  and  Isis,  goddess  of 
the  underworld,  as  twin  cobras  with  their  tails  knotted  together.  The  same 
symbol  was  used  in  China  to  portray  Fuxi  and  Nuwa,  creators  of  humanity  and 
of  writing.  The  representations  in  Christianity  are  less  abstract,  more  like 
personalities,  but  the  familiar  Western  images  of  the  Virgin  Mary  with  the  Christ 
Child  and  the  Pieta  both  express  the  female/male  dual  unity,  as  does  the 
traditional  insistence  on  the  androgyny  of  Christ. 

It  should  also  be  noted,  finally,  that  the  structure  of  the  brain  itself  at  a  gross 
morphological  level  appears  to  reflect  this  duality.  This,  to  me,  indicates  the 
fundamental,  beyond-the-metaphorical  reality  of  this  symbolically 
feminine/masculine  divide,  since  the  brain  is  adapted,  by  definition,  to  reality 
itself  (that  is,  reality  conceptualized  in  this  quasi-Darwinian  manner).  Elkhonon 
Goldberg,  student  of  the  great  Russian  neuropsychologist  Alexander  Luria,  has 
proposed  quite  lucidly  and  directly  that  the  very  hemispheric  structure  of  the 


cortex  reflects  the  fundamental  division  between  novelty  (the  unknown,  or 
chaos)  and  routinization  (the  known,  order).  He  doesn’t  make  reference  to  the 
symbols  representing  the  structure  of  the  world  in  reference  to  this  theory,  but 
that’s  all  the  better:  an  idea  is  more  credible  when  it  emerges  as  a  consequence  of 
investigations  in  different  realms. 

We  already  know  all  this,  but  we  don’t  know  we  know  it.  But  we  immediately 
comprehend  it  when  it’s  articulated  in  a  manner  such  as  this.  Everyone 
understands  order  and  chaos,  world  and  underworld,  when  it’s  explained  using 
these  terms.  We  all  have  a  palpable  sense  of  the  chaos  lurking  under  everything 
familiar.  That’s  why  we  understand  the  strange,  surreal  stories  of  Pinocchio,  and 
Sleeping  Beauty,  and  The  Lion  King,  and  The  Little  Mermaid,  and  Beauty  and 
the  Beast,  with  their  eternal  landscapes  of  known  and  unknown,  world  and 
underworld.  We’ve  all  been  in  both  places,  many  times:  sometimes  by 
happenstance,  sometimes  by  choice. 

Many  things  begin  to  fall  into  place  when  you  begin  to  consciously 
understand  the  world  in  this  manner.  It’s  as  if  the  knowledge  of  your  body  and 
soul  falls  into  alignment  with  the  knowledge  of  your  intellect.  And  there’s  more: 
such  knowledge  is  proscriptive,  as  well  as  descriptive.  This  is  the  kind  of 
knowing  what  that  helps  you  know  how.  This  is  the  kind  of  is  from  which  you 
can  derive  an  ought.  The  Taoist  juxtaposition  of  yin  and  yang,  for  example, 
doesn’t  simply  portray  chaos  and  order  as  the  fundamental  elements  of  Being — it 
also  tells  you  how  to  act.  The  Way,  the  Taoist  path  of  life,  is  represented  by  (or 
exists  on)  the  border  between  the  twin  serpents.  The  Way  is  the  path  of  proper 
Being.  It’s  the  same  Way  as  that  referred  to  by  Christ  in  John  14:6: 1  am  the  way, 
and  the  truth  and  the  life.  The  same  idea  is  expressed  in  Matthew  7:14:  Because 
strait  is  the  gate,  and  narrow  is  the  way,  which  leadeth  unto  life,  and  few  there 
be  that  find  it. 

We  eternally  inhabit  order,  surrounded  by  chaos.  We  eternally  occupy  known 
territory,  surrounded  by  the  unknown.  We  experience  meaningful  engagement 
when  we  mediate  appropriately  between  them.  We  are  adapted,  in  the  deepest 
Darwinian  sense,  not  to  the  world  of  objects,  but  to  the  meta-realities  of  order 
and  chaos,  yang  and  yin.  Chaos  and  order  make  up  the  eternal,  transcendent 
environment  of  the  living. 

To  straddle  that  fundamental  duality  is  to  be  balanced:  to  have  one  foot  firmly 
planted  in  order  and  security,  and  the  other  in  chaos,  possibility,  growth  and 
adventure.  When  life  suddenly  reveals  itself  as  intense,  gripping  and  meaningful; 
when  time  passes  and  you’re  so  engrossed  in  what  you’re  doing  you  don’t  notice 
— it  is  there  and  then  that  you  are  located  precisely  on  the  border  between  order 


and  chaos.  The  subjective  meaning  that  we  encounter  there  is  the  reaction  of  our 
deepest  being,  our  neurologically  and  evolutionarily  grounded  instinctive  self, 
indicating  that  we  are  ensuring  the  stability  but  also  the  expansion  of  habitable, 
productive  territory,  of  space  that  is  personal,  social  and  natural.  It’s  the  right 
place  to  be,  in  every  sense.  You  are  there  when — and  where — it  matters.  That’s 
what  music  is  telling  you,  too,  when  you’re  listening — even  more,  perhaps, 
when  you’re  dancing — when  its  harmonious  layered  patterns  of  predictability 
and  unpredictability  make  meaning  itself  well  up  from  the  most  profound  depths 
of  your  Being. 

Chaos  and  order  are  fundamental  elements  because  every  lived  situation  (even 
every  conceivable  lived  situation)  is  made  up  of  both.  No  matter  where  we  are, 
there  are  some  things  we  can  identify,  make  use  of,  and  predict,  and  some  things 
we  neither  know  nor  understand.  No  matter  who  we  are,  Kalahari  Desert- 
dweller  or  Wall  Street  banker,  some  things  are  under  our  control,  and  some 
things  are  not.  That’s  why  both  can  understand  the  same  stories,  and  dwell 
within  the  confines  of  the  same  eternal  truths.  Finally,  the  fundamental  reality  of 
chaos  and  order  is  true  for  everything  alive,  not  only  for  us.  Living  things  are 
always  to  be  found  in  places  they  can  master,  surrounded  by  things  and 
situations  that  make  them  vulnerable. 

Order  is  not  enough.  You  can’t  just  be  stable,  and  secure,  and  unchanging, 
because  there  are  still  vital  and  important  new  things  to  be  learned.  Nonetheless, 
chaos  can  be  too  much.  You  can’t  long  tolerate  being  swamped  and 
overwhelmed  beyond  your  capacity  to  cope  while  you  are  learning  what  you  still 
need  to  know.  Thus,  you  need  to  place  one  foot  in  what  you  have  mastered  and 
understood  and  the  other  in  what  you  are  currently  exploring  and  mastering. 
Then  you  have  positioned  yourself  where  the  terror  of  existence  is  under  control 
and  you  are  secure,  but  where  you  are  also  alert  and  engaged.  That  is  where 
there  is  something  new  to  master  and  some  way  that  you  can  be  improved.  That 
is  where  meaning  is  to  be  found. 

The  Garden  of  Eden 

Remember,  as  discussed  earlier,  that  the  Genesis  stories  were  amalgamated  from 
several  sources.  After  the  newer  Priestly  story  (Genesis  1),  recounting  the 
emergence  of  order  from  chaos,  comes  the  second,  even  more  ancient,  “Jahwist” 
part,  beginning,  essentially,  with  Genesis  2.  The  Jahwist  account,  which  uses  the 
name  YHWH  or  Jahweh  to  represent  God,  contains  the  story  of  Adam  and  Eve, 
along  with  a  much  fuller  explication  of  the  events  of  the  sixth  day  alluded  to  in 
the  previous  “Priestly”  story.  The  continuity  between  the  stories  appears  to  be 


the  result  of  careful  editing  by  the  person  or  persons  known  singly  to  biblical 
scholars  as  the  “Redactor,”  who  wove  the  stories  together.  This  may  have 
occurred  when  the  peoples  of  two  traditions  united,  for  one  reason  or  another, 
and  the  subsequent  illogic  of  their  melded  stories,  growing  together  over  time  in 
an  ungainly  fashion,  bothered  someone  conscious,  courageous,  and  obsessed 
with  coherence. 

According  to  the  Jahwist  creation  story,  God  first  created  a  bounded  space, 
known  as  Eden  (which,  in  Aramaic — Jesus’s  putative  language — means  well- 
watered  place)  or  Paradise  (pairidaeza  in  old  Iranian  or  Avestan,  which  means 
walled  or  protected  enclosure  or  garden).  God  placed  Adam  in  there,  along  with 
all  manner  of  fruit-bearing  trees,  two  of  which  were  marked  out.  One  of  these 
was  the  Tree  of  Life;  the  other,  the  Tree  of  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil.  God 
then  told  Adam  to  have  his  fill  of  fruit,  as  he  wished,  but  added  that  the  fruit  of 
the  Tree  of  the  Knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil  was  forbidden.  After  that,  He 
created  Eve  as  a  partner  for  Adam. fn2 

Adam  and  Eve  don’t  seem  very  conscious,  at  the  beginning,  when  they  are 
first  placed  in  Paradise,  and  they  were  certainly  not  self-conscious.  As  the  story 
insists,  the  original  parents  were  naked,  but  not  ashamed.  Such  phrasing  implies 
first  that  it’s  perfectly  natural  and  normal  for  people  to  be  ashamed  of  their 
nakedness  (otherwise  nothing  would  have  to  be  said  about  its  absence)  and 
second  that  there  was  something  amiss,  for  better  or  worse,  with  our  first 
parents.  Although  there  are  exceptions,  the  only  people  around  now  who  would 
be  unashamed  if  suddenly  dropped  naked  into  a  public  place — excepting  the  odd 
exhibitionist — are  those  younger  than  three  years  of  age.  In  fact,  a  common 
nightmare  involves  the  sudden  appearance  of  the  dreamer,  naked,  on  a  stage  in 
front  of  a  packed  house. 

In  the  third  verse  of  Genesis,  a  serpent  appears — first,  apparently,  in  legged 
form.  God  only  knows  why  He  allowed — or  placed — such  a  creature  in  the 
garden.  I  have  long  puzzled  over  the  meaning  of  this.  It  seems  to  be  a  reflection, 
in  part,  of  the  order/chaos  dichotomy  characterizing  all  of  experience,  with 
Paradise  serving  as  habitable  order  and  the  serpent  playing  the  role  of  chaos.  The 
serpent  in  Eden  therefore  means  the  same  thing  as  the  black  dot  in  the  yin  side  of 
the  Taoist  yin/yang  symbol  of  totality — that  is,  the  possibility  of  the  unknown 
and  revolutionary  suddenly  manifesting  itself  where  everything  appears  calm. 

It  just  does  not  appear  possible,  even  for  God  himself,  to  make  a  bounded 
space  completely  protected  from  the  outside — not  in  the  real  world,  with  its 
necessary  limitations,  surrounded  by  the  transcendent.  The  outside,  chaos, 
always  sneaks  into  the  inside,  because  nothing  can  be  completely  walled  off 
from  the  rest  of  reality.  So  even  the  ultimate  in  safe  spaces  inevitably  harbours  a 


snake.  There  were — forever — genuine,  quotidian,  reptilian  snakes  in  the  grass 
and  in  the  trees  of  our  original  African  paradise.  Even  had  all  of  those  been 
banished,  however  (in  some  inconceivable  manner,  by  some  primordial  St. 
George)  snakes  would  have  still  remained  in  the  form  of  our  primordial  human 
rivals  (at  least  when  they  were  acting  like  enemies,  from  our  limited,  in-group, 
kin-bonded  perspectives).  There  was,  after  all,  no  shortage  of  conflict  and 
warfare  among  our  ancestors,  tribal  and  otherwise. 

And  even  if  we  had  defeated  all  the  snakes  that  beset  us  from  without, 
reptilian  and  human  alike,  we  would  still  not  have  been  safe.  Nor  are  we  now. 
We  have  seen  the  enemy,  after  all,  and  he  is  us.  The  snake  inhabits  each  of  our 
souls.  This  is  the  reason,  as  far  as  I  can  tell,  for  the  strange  Christian  insistence, 
made  most  explicit  by  John  Milton,  that  the  snake  in  the  Garden  of  Eden  was 
also  Satan,  the  Spirit  of  Evil  itself.  The  importance  of  this  symbolic 
identification — its  staggering  brilliance — can  hardly  be  overstated.  It  is  through 
such  millennia-long  exercise  of  the  imagination  that  the  idea  of  abstracted  moral 
concepts  themselves,  with  all  they  entail,  developed.  Work  beyond 
comprehension  was  invested  into  the  idea  of  Good  and  Evil,  and  its  surrounding, 
dream-like  metaphor.  The  worst  of  all  possible  snakes  is  the  eternal  human 
proclivity  for  evil.  The  worst  of  all  possible  snakes  is  psychological,  spiritual, 
personal,  internal.  No  walls,  however  tall,  will  keep  that  out.  Even  if  the  fortress 
were  thick  enough,  in  principle,  to  keep  everything  bad  whatsoever  outside,  it 
would  immediately  appear  again  within.  As  the  great  Russian  writer  Aleksandr 
Solzhenitsyn  insisted,  the  line  dividing  good  and  evil  cuts  through  the  heart  of 
every  human  being. 

There  is  simply  no  way  to  wall  off  some  isolated  portion  of  the  greater 
surrounding  reality  and  make  everything  permanently  predictable  and  safe 
within  it.  Some  of  what  has  been  no-matter-how-carefully  excluded  will  always 
sneak  back  in.  A  serpent,  metaphorically  speaking,  will  inevitably  appear.  Even 
the  most  assiduous  of  parents  cannot  fully  protect  their  children,  even  if  they 
lock  them  in  the  basement,  safely  away  from  drugs,  alcohol  and  internet  porn.  In 
that  extreme  case,  the  too-cautious,  too-caring  parent  merely  substitutes  him  or 
herself  for  the  other  terrible  problems  of  life.  This  is  the  great  Freudian  Oedipal 
nightmare.  It  is  far  better  to  render  Beings  in  your  care  competent  than  to 
protect  them. 

And  even  if  it  were  possible  to  permanently  banish  everything  threatening — 
everything  dangerous  (and,  therefore,  everything  challenging  and  interesting), 
that  would  mean  only  that  another  danger  would  emerge:  that  of  permanent 
human  infantilism  and  absolute  uselessness.  How  could  the  nature  of  man  ever 


reach  its  full  potential  without  challenge  and  danger?  How  dull  and  contemptible 
would  we  become  if  there  was  no  longer  reason  to  pay  attention?  Maybe  God 
thought  His  new  creation  would  be  able  to  handle  the  serpent,  and  considered  its 
presence  the  lesser  of  two  evils. 

Question  for  parents:  do  you  want  to  make  your  children  safe,  or  strong? 

In  any  case,  there’s  a  serpent  in  the  Garden,  and  he’s  a  “subtil”  beast, 
according  to  the  ancient  story  (difficult  to  see,  vaporous,  cunning,  deceitful  and 
treacherous).  It  therefore  comes  as  no  surprise  when  he  decides  to  play  a  trick  on 
Eve.  Why  Eve,  instead  of  Adam?  It  could  just  be  chance.  It  was  fifty-fifty  for 
Eve,  statistically  speaking,  and  those  are  pretty  high  odds.  But  I  have  learned 
that  these  old  stories  contain  nothing  superfluous.  Anything  accidental — 
anything  that  does  not  serve  the  plot — has  long  been  forgotten  in  the  telling.  As 
the  Russian  playwright  Anton  Chekhov  advised,  “If  there  is  a  rifle  hanging  on 
the  wall  in  act  one,  it  must  be  fired  in  the  next  act.  Otherwise  it  has  no  business 
being  there. Perhaps  primordial  Eve  had  more  reason  to  attend  to  serpents 
than  Adam.  Maybe  they  were  more  likely,  for  example,  to  prey  on  her  tree¬ 
dwelling  infants.  Perhaps  it  is  for  this  reason  that  Eve’s  daughters  are  more 
protective,  self-conscious,  fearful  and  nervous,  to  this  day  (even,  and  especially, 
in  the  most  egalitarian  of  modern  human  societies  ).  In  any  case,  the  serpent 
tells  Eve  that  if  she  eats  the  forbidden  fruit,  she  won’t  die.  Instead,  her  eyes  will 
be  opened.  She  will  become  like  God,  knowing  good  from  evil.  Of  course,  the 
serpent  doesn’t  let  her  know  she  will  be  like  God  in  only  that  one  way.  But  he  is 
a  serpent,  after  all.  Being  human,  and  wanting  to  know  more,  Eve  decides  to  eat 
the  fruit.  Poof!  She  wakes  up:  she’s  conscious,  or  perhaps  self-conscious,  for  the 
first  time. 

Now,  no  clear-seeing,  conscious  woman  is  going  to  tolerate  an  unawakened 
man.  So,  Eve  immediately  shares  the  fruit  with  Adam.  That  makes  him  self- 
conscious.  Little  has  changed.  Women  have  been  making  men  self-conscious 
since  the  beginning  of  time.  They  do  this  primarily  by  rejecting  them — but  they 
also  do  it  by  shaming  them,  if  men  do  not  take  responsibility.  Since  women  bear 
the  primary  burden  of  reproduction,  it’s  no  wonder.  It  is  very  hard  to  see  how  it 
could  be  otherwise.  But  the  capacity  of  women  to  shame  men  and  render  them 
self-conscious  is  still  a  primal  force  of  nature. 

Now,  you  may  ask:  what  in  the  world  have  snakes  got  to  do  with  vision?  Well, 
first,  it’s  clearly  of  some  importance  to  see  them,  because  they  might  prey  on 
you  (particularly  when  you’re  little  and  live  in  trees,  like  our  arboreal  ancestors). 
Dr.  Lynn  Isbell,  professor  of  anthropology  and  animal  behaviour  at  the 
University  of  California,  has  suggested  that  the  stunningly  acute  vision  almost 


uniquely  possessed  by  human  beings  was  an  adaptation  forced  on  us  tens  of 
millions  of  years  ago  by  the  necessity  of  detecting  and  avoiding  the  terrible 
danger  of  snakes,  with  whom  our  ancestors  co-evolved.  This  is  perhaps  one  of 
the  reasons  the  snake  features  in  the  garden  of  Paradise  as  the  creature  who  gave 
us  the  vision  of  God  (in  addition  to  serving  as  the  primordial  and  eternal  enemy 
of  mankind).  This  is  perhaps  one  of  the  reasons  why  Mary,  the  eternal, 
archetypal  mother — Eve  perfected — is  so  commonly  shown  in  medieval  and 
Renaissance  iconography  holding  the  Christ  Child  in  the  air,  as  far  away  as 
possible  from  a  predatory  reptile,  which  she  has  firmly  pinned  under  her  foot. 
And  there’s  more.  It’s  fruit  that  the  snake  offers,  and  fruit  is  also  associated  with 
a  transformation  of  vision,  in  that  our  ability  to  see  color  is  an  adaptation  that 
allows  us  to  rapidly  detect  the  ripe  and  therefore  edible  bounty  of  trees. 

Our  primordial  parents  hearkened  to  the  snake.  They  ate  the  fruit.  Their  eyes 
opened.  They  both  awoke.  You  might  think,  as  Eve  did  initially,  that  this  would 
be  a  good  thing.  Sometimes,  however,  half  a  gift  is  worse  than  none.  Adam  and 
Eve  wake  up,  all  right,  but  only  enough  to  discover  some  terrible  things.  First, 
they  notice  that  they’re  naked. 

The  Naked  Ape 

My  son  figured  out  that  he  was  naked  well  before  he  was  three.  He  wanted  to 
dress  himself.  He  kept  the  washroom  door  firmly  shut.  He  didn’t  appear  in 
public  without  his  clothes.  I  couldn’t  for  the  life  of  me  see  how  this  had  anything 
to  do  with  his  upbringing.  It  was  his  own  discovery,  his  own  realization,  and  his 
own  choice  of  reactions.  It  looked  built  in,  to  me. 

What  does  it  mean  to  know  yourself  naked — or,  potentially  worse,  to  know 
yourself  and  your  partner  naked?  All  manner  of  terrible  things — expressed  in  the 
rather  horrifying  manner,  for  example,  of  the  Renaissance  painter  Hans  Baldung 
Grien,  whose  painting  inspired  the  illustration  that  begins  this  chapter.  Naked 
means  vulnerable  and  easily  damaged.  Naked  means  subject  to  judgment  for 
beauty  and  health.  Naked  means  unprotected  and  unarmed  in  the  jungle  of  nature 
and  man.  This  is  why  Adam  and  Eve  became  ashamed,  immediately  after  their 
eyes  were  opened.  They  could  see — and  what  they  first  saw  was  themselves. 
Their  faults  stood  out.  Their  vulnerability  was  on  display.  Unlike  other 
mammals,  whose  delicate  abdomens  are  protected  by  the  armour-like  expanse  of 
their  backs,  they  were  upright  creatures,  with  the  most  vulnerable  parts  of  their 
body  presented  to  the  world.  And  worse  was  to  come.  Adam  and  Eve  made 
themselves  loincloths  (in  the  International  Standard  Version;  aprons  in  the  King 


James  Version)  right  away,  to  cover  up  their  fragile  bodies — and  to  protect  their 
egos.  Then  they  promptly  skittered  off  and  hid.  In  their  vulnerability,  now  fully 
realized,  they  felt  unworthy  to  stand  before  God. 

If  you  can’t  identify  with  that  sentiment,  you’re  just  not  thinking.  Beauty 
shames  the  ugly.  Strength  shames  the  weak.  Death  shames  the  living — and  the 
Ideal  shames  us  all.  Thus  we  fear  it,  resent  it — even  hate  it  (and,  of  course,  that’s 
the  theme  next  examined  in  Genesis,  in  the  story  of  Cain  and  Abel).  What  are  we 
to  do  about  that?  Abandon  all  ideals  of  beauty,  health,  brilliance  and  strength? 
That’s  not  a  good  solution.  That  would  merely  ensure  that  we  would  feel 
ashamed,  all  the  time — and  that  we  would  even  more  justly  deserve  it.  I  don’t 
want  women  who  can  stun  by  their  mere  presence  to  disappear  just  so  that  others 
can  feel  unself  conscious.  I  don’t  want  intellects  such  as  John  von  Neumann’s  to 
vanish,  just  because  of  my  barely-grade-twelve  grasp  of  mathematics.  By  the 
time  he  was  nineteen,  he  had  redefined  numbers.  Numbers!  Thank  God  for 
John  von  Neumann!  Thank  God  for  Grace  Kelly  and  Anita  Ekberg  and  Monica 
Bellucci!  I’m  proud  to  feel  unworthy  in  the  presence  of  people  like  that.  It’s  the 
price  we  all  pay  for  aim,  achievement  and  ambition.  But  it’s  also  no  wonder  that 
Adam  and  Eve  covered  themselves  up. 

The  next  part  of  the  story  is  downright  farcical,  in  my  opinion,  although  it’s 
also  tragic  and  terrible.  That  evening,  when  Eden  cools  down,  God  goes  out  for 
His  evening  stroll.  But  Adam  is  absent.  This  puzzles  God,  who  is  accustomed  to 
walking  with  him.  “Adam,”  calls  God,  apparently  forgetting  that  He  can  see 
through  bushes,  “Where  are  you?”  Adam  immediately  reveals  himself,  but 
badly:  first  as  a  neurotic;  then,  as  a  ratfink.  The  creator  of  all  the  universe  calls, 
and  Adam  replies:  “I  heard  you,  God.  But  I  was  naked,  and  hid.”  What  does  this 
mean?  It  means  that  people,  unsettled  by  their  vulnerability,  eternally  fear  to  tell 
the  truth,  to  mediate  between  chaos  and  order,  and  to  manifest  their  destiny.  In 
other  words,  they  are  afraid  to  walk  with  God.  That’s  not  particularly  admirable, 
perhaps,  but  it’s  certainly  understandable.  God’s  a  judgmental  father.  His 
standards  are  high.  He’s  hard  to  please. 

God  says,  “Who  told  you  that  you  were  naked?  Did  you  eat  something  you 
weren’t  supposed  to?”  And  Adam,  in  his  wretchedness,  points  right  at  Eve,  his 
love,  his  partner,  his  soul-mate,  and  snitches  on  her.  And  then  he  blames  God. 

He  says,  “The  woman,  whom  you  gave  to  me,  she  gave  it  to  me  (and  then  I  ate 
it).”  How  pathetic — and  how  accurate.  The  first  woman  made  the  first  man  self- 
conscious  and  resentful.  Then  the  first  man  blamed  the  woman.  And  then  the 
first  man  blamed  God.  This  is  exactly  how  every  spurned  male  feels,  to  this  day. 
First,  he  feels  small,  in  front  of  the  potential  object  of  his  love,  after  she 
denigrates  his  reproductive  suitability.  Then  he  curses  God  for  making  her  so 


bitchy,  himself  so  useless  (if  he  has  any  sense)  and  Being  itself  so  deeply  flawed. 
Then  he  turns  to  thoughts  of  revenge.  How  thoroughly  contemptible  (and  how 
utterly  understandable).  At  least  the  woman  had  the  serpent  to  blame,  and  it  later 
turns  out  that  snake  is  Satan  himself,  unlikely  as  that  seems.  Thus,  we  can 
understand  and  sympathize  with  Eve’s  error.  She  was  deceived  by  the  best.  But 
Adam!  No  one  forced  his  words  from  his  mouth. 

Unfortunately,  the  worst  isn’t  over — for  Man  or  Beast.  First,  God  curses  the 
serpent,  telling  him  that  he  will  now  have  to  slither  around,  legless,  forever  in 
peril  of  being  stomped  on  by  angry  humans.  Second,  He  tells  the  woman  that  she 
will  now  bring  forth  children  in  sorrow,  and  desire  an  unworthy,  sometimes 
resentful  man,  who  will  in  consequence  lord  her  biological  fate  over  her, 
permanently.  What  might  this  mean?  It  could  just  mean  that  God  is  a  patriarchal 
tyrant,  as  politically  motivated  interpretations  of  the  ancient  story  insist.  I  think 
it’s — merely  descriptive.  Merely.  And  here  is  why:  As  human  beings  evolved, 
the  brains  that  eventually  gave  rise  to  self-consciousness  expanded 
tremendously.  This  produced  an  evolutionary  arms  race  between  fetal  head  and 
female  pelvis.  The  female  graciously  widened  her  hips,  almost  to  the  point 
where  running  would  no  longer  be  possible.  The  baby,  for  his  part,  allowed 
himself  to  be  born  more  than  a  year  early,  compared  to  other  mammals  of  his 
size,  and  evolved  a  semi-collapsible  head.  This  was  and  is  a  painful  adjustment 
for  both.  The  essentially  fetal  baby  is  almost  completely  dependent  on  his 
mother  for  everything  during  that  first  year.  The  programmability  of  his  massive 
brain  means  that  he  must  be  trained  until  he  is  eighteen  (or  thirty)  before  being 
pushed  out  of  the  nest.  This  is  to  say  nothing  of  the  woman’s  consequential  pain 
in  childbirth,  and  high  risk  of  death  for  mother  and  infant  alike.  This  all  means 
that  women  pay  a  high  price  for  pregnancy  and  child-rearing,  particularly  in  the 
early  stages,  and  that  one  of  the  inevitable  consequences  is  increased  dependence 
upon  the  sometimes  unreliable  and  always  problematic  good  graces  of  men. 

After  God  tells  Eve  what  is  going  to  happen,  now  that  she  has  awakened,  He 
turns  to  Adam — who,  along  with  his  male  descendants,  doesn’t  get  off  any 
easier.  God  says  something  akin  to  this:  “Man,  because  you  attended  to  the 
woman,  your  eyes  have  been  opened.  Your  godlike  vision,  granted  to  you  by 
snake,  fruit  and  lover,  allows  you  to  see  far,  even  into  the  future.  But  those  who 
see  into  the  future  can  also  eternally  see  trouble  coming,  and  must  then  prepare 
for  all  contingencies  and  possibilities.  To  do  that,  you  will  have  to  eternally 
sacrifice  the  present  for  the  future.  You  must  put  aside  pleasure  for  security.  In 
short:  you  will  have  to  work.  And  it’s  going  to  be  difficult.  I  hope  you’re  fond  of 
thorns  and  thistles,  because  you’re  going  to  grow  a  lot  of  them.” 


And  then  God  banishes  the  first  man  and  the  first  woman  from  Paradise,  out 
of  infancy,  out  of  the  unconscious  animal  world,  into  the  horrors  of  history  itself. 
And  then  He  puts  cherubim  and  a  flaming  sword  at  the  gate  of  Eden,  just  to  stop 
them  from  eating  the  Fruit  of  the  Tree  of  Life.  That,  in  particular,  appears  rather 
mean-spirited.  Why  not  just  make  the  poor  humans  immortal,  right  away? 
Particularly  if  that  is  your  plan  for  the  ultimate  future,  anyway,  as  the  story  goes? 
But  who  would  dare  to  question  God? 

Perhaps  Heaven  is  something  you  must  build,  and  immortality  something  you 
must  earn. 

And  so  we  return  to  our  original  query:  Why  would  someone  buy  prescription 
medication  for  his  dog,  and  then  so  carefully  administer  it,  when  he  would  not 
do  the  same  for  himself?  Now  you  have  the  answer,  derived  from  one  of  the 
foundational  texts  of  mankind.  Why  should  anyone  take  care  of  anything  as 
naked,  ugly,  ashamed,  frightened,  worthless,  cowardly,  resentful,  defensive  and 
accusatory  as  a  descendant  of  Adam?  Even  if  that  thing,  that  being,  is  himself? 
And  I  do  not  mean  at  all  to  exclude  women  with  this  phrasing. 

All  the  reasons  we  have  discussed  so  far  for  taking  a  dim  view  of  humanity 
are  applicable  to  others,  as  much  as  to  the  self.  They’re  generalizations  about 
human  nature;  nothing  more  specific.  But  you  know  so  much  more  about 
yourself.  You’re  bad  enough,  as  other  people  know  you.  But  only  you  know  the 
full  range  of  your  secret  transgressions,  insufficiencies  and  inadequacies.  No  one 
is  more  familiar  than  you  with  all  the  ways  your  mind  and  body  are  flawed.  No 
one  has  more  reason  to  hold  you  in  contempt,  to  see  you  as  pathetic — and  by 
withholding  something  that  might  do  you  good,  you  can  punish  yourself  for  all 
your  failings.  A  dog,  a  harmless,  innocent,  unselfconscious  dog,  is  clearly  more 
deserving. 

But  if  you  are  not  yet  convinced,  let  us  consider  another  vital  issue.  Order, 
chaos,  life,  death,  sin,  vision,  work  and  suffering:  that  is  not  enough  for  the 
authors  of  Genesis,  nor  for  humanity  itself.  The  story  continues,  in  all  its 
catastrophe  and  tragedy,  and  the  people  involved  (that’s  us)  must  contend  with 
yet  another  painful  awakening.  We  are  next  fated  to  contemplate  morality  itself. 

Good  and  Evil 

When  their  eyes  are  opened,  Adam  and  Eve  realize  more  than  just  their 
nakedness  and  the  necessity  of  toil.  They  also  come  to  know  Good  and  Evil  (the 
serpent  says,  referring  to  the  fruit,  “For  God  doth  know  that  in  the  day  ye  eat 
thereof,  then  your  eyes  shall  be  opened,  and  ye  shall  be  as  gods,  knowing  good 
and  evil”).  What  could  that  possibly  mean?  What  could  be  left  to  explore  and 


relate,  after  the  vast  ground  already  covered?  Well,  simple  context  indicates  that 
it  must  have  something  to  do  with  gardens,  snakes,  disobedience,  fruit,  sexuality 
and  nakedness.  It  was  the  last  item — nakedness — that  finally  clued  me  in.  It  took 
years. 

Dogs  are  predators.  So  are  cats.  They  kill  things  and  eat  them.  It’s  not  pretty. 
But  weTl  take  them  as  pets  and  care  for  them,  and  give  them  their  medication 
when  they’re  sick,  regardless.  Why?  They’re  predators,  but  it’s  just  their  nature. 
They  do  not  bear  responsibility  for  it.  They’re  hungry,  not  evil.  They  don’t  have 
the  presence  of  mind,  the  creativity — and,  above  all,  the  self-consciousness — 
necessary  for  the  inspired  cruelty  of  man. 

Why  not?  It’s  simple.  Unlike  us,  predators  have  no  comprehension  of  their 
fundamental  weakness,  their  fundamental  vulnerability,  their  own  subjugation  to 
pain  and  death.  But  we  know  exactly  how  and  where  we  can  be  hurt,  and  why. 
That  is  as  good  a  definition  as  any  of  self-consciousness.  We  are  aware  of  our 
own  defencelessness,  finitude  and  mortality.  We  can  feel  pain,  and  self-disgust, 
and  shame,  and  horror,  and  we  know  it.  We  know  what  makes  us  suffer.  We 
know  how  dread  and  pain  can  be  inflicted  on  us — and  that  means  we  know 
exactly  how  to  inflict  it  on  others.  We  know  how  we  are  naked,  and  how  that 
nakedness  can  be  exploited — and  that  means  we  know  how  others  are  naked, 
and  how  they  can  be  exploited. 

We  can  terrify  other  people,  consciously.  We  can  hurt  and  humiliate  them  for 
faults  we  understand  only  too  well.  We  can  torture  them — literally — slowly, 
artfully  and  terribly.  That’s  far  more  than  predation.  That’s  a  qualitative  shift  in 
understanding.  That’s  a  cataclysm  as  large  as  the  development  of  self- 
consciousness  itself.  That’s  the  entry  of  the  knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil  into  the 
world.  That’s  a  second  as-yet-unhealed  fracture  in  the  structure  of  Existence. 
That’s  the  transformation  of  Being  itself  into  a  moral  endeavour — all  attendant 
on  the  development  of  sophisticated  self-consciousness. 

Only  man  could  conceive  of  the  rack,  the  iron  maiden  and  the  thumbscrew. 
Only  man  will  inflict  suffering  for  the  sake  of  suffering.  That  is  the  best 
definition  of  evil  I  have  been  able  to  formulate.  Animals  can’t  manage  that,  but 
humans,  with  their  excruciating,  semi-divine  capacities,  most  certainly  can.  And 
with  this  realization  we  have  well-nigh  full  legitimization  of  the  idea,  very 
unpopular  in  modern  intellectual  circles,  of  Original  Sin.  And  who  would  dare  to 
say  that  there  was  no  element  of  voluntary  choice  in  our  evolutionary,  individual 
and  theological  transformation?  Our  ancestors  chose  their  sexual  partners,  and 
they  selected  for — consciousness?  And  self-consciousness?  And  moral 
knowledge?  And  who  can  deny  the  sense  of  existential  guilt  that  pervades 
human  experience?  And  who  could  avoid  noting  that  without  that  guilt — that 


sense  of  inbuilt  corruption  and  capacity  for  wrongdoing — a  man  is  one  step  from 
psychopathy? 

Human  beings  have  a  great  capacity  for  wrongdoing.  It’s  an  attribute  that  is 
unique  in  the  world  of  life.  We  can  and  do  make  things  worse,  voluntarily,  with 
full  knowledge  of  what  we  are  doing  (as  well  as  accidentally,  and  carelessly,  and 
in  a  manner  that  is  willfully  blind).  Given  that  terrible  capacity,  that  proclivity 
for  malevolent  actions,  is  it  any  wonder  we  have  a  hard  time  taking  care  of 
ourselves,  or  others — or  even  that  we  doubt  the  value  of  the  entire  human 
enterprise?  And  we’ve  suspected  ourselves,  for  good  reason,  for  a  very  long 
time.  Thousands  of  years  ago,  the  ancient  Mesopotamians  believed,  for  example, 
that  mankind  itself  was  made  from  the  blood  of  Kingu,  the  single  most  terrible 
monster  that  the  great  Goddess  of  Chaos  could  produce,  in  her  most  vengeful 
and  destructive  moments.  After  drawing  conclusions  such  as  that,  how  could 
we  not  question  the  value  of  our  being,  and  even  of  Being  itself?  Who  then  could 
be  faced  with  illness,  in  himself  or  another,  without  doubting  the  moral  utility  of 
prescribing  a  healing  medicament?  And  no  one  understands  the  darkness  of  the 
individual  better  than  the  individual  himself.  Who,  then,  when  ill,  is  going  to  be 
fully  committed  to  his  own  care? 

Perhaps  Man  is  something  that  should  never  have  been.  Perhaps  the  world 
should  even  be  cleansed  of  ah  human  presence,  so  that  Being  and  consciousness 
could  return  to  the  innocent  brutality  of  the  animal.  I  believe  that  the  person  who 
claims  never  to  have  wished  for  such  a  thing  has  neither  consulted  his  memory 
nor  confronted  his  darkest  fantasies. 

What  then  is  to  be  done? 

A  Spark  of  the  Divine 

In  Genesis  1,  God  creates  the  world  with  the  divine,  truthful  Word,  generating 
habitable,  paradisal  order  from  the  precosmogonic  chaos.  He  then  creates  Man 
and  Woman  in  His  Image,  imbuing  them  with  the  capacity  to  do  the  same — to 
create  order  from  chaos,  and  continue  His  work.  At  each  stage  of  creation, 
including  that  involving  the  formation  of  the  first  couple,  God  reflects  upon  what 
has  come  to  be,  and  pronounces  it  Good. 

The  juxtaposition  of  Genesis  1  with  Genesis  2  &  3  (the  latter  two  chapters 
outlining  the  fall  of  man,  describing  why  our  lot  is  so  tragedy-ridden  and 
ethically  torturous)  produces  a  narrative  sequence  almost  unbearable  in  its 
profundity.  The  moral  of  Genesis  1  is  that  Being  brought  into  existence  through 
true  speech  is  Good.  This  is  true  even  of  man  himself,  prior  to  his  separation 
from  God.  This  goodness  is  terribly  disrupted  by  the  events  of  the  fall  (and  of 


Cain  and  Abel  and  the  Flood  and  the  Tower  of  Babel),  but  we  retain  an 
intimation  of  the  prelapsarian  state.  We  remember,  so  to  speak.  We  remain 
eternally  nostalgic  for  the  innocence  of  childhood,  the  divine,  unconscious  Being 
of  the  animal,  and  the  untouched  cathedral-like  old-growth  forest.  We  find 
respite  in  such  things.  We  worship  them,  even  if  we  are  self-proclaimed  atheistic 
environmentalists  of  the  most  anti-human  sort.  The  original  state  of  Nature, 
conceived  in  this  manner,  is  paradisal.  But  we  are  no  longer  one  with  God  and 
Nature,  and  there  is  no  simple  turning  back. 

The  original  Man  and  Woman,  existing  in  unbroken  unity  with  their  Creator, 
did  not  appear  conscious  (and  certainly  not  self-conscious).  Their  eyes  were  not 
open.  But,  in  their  perfection,  they  were  also  less,  not  more,  than  their  post-Fail 
counterparts.  Their  goodness  was  something  bestowed,  rather  than  deserved  or 
earned.  They  exercised  no  choice.  God  knows,  that’s  easier.  But  maybe  it’s  not 
better  than,  for  example,  goodness  genuinely  earned.  Maybe,  even  in  some 
cosmic  sense  (assuming  that  consciousness  itself  is  a  phenomenon  of  cosmic 
significance),  free  choice  matters.  Who  can  speak  with  certainty  about  such 
things?  I  am  unwilling  to  take  these  questions  off  the  table,  however,  merely 
because  they  are  difficult.  So,  here’s  a  proposition:  perhaps  it  is  not  simply  the 
emergence  of  self-consciousness  and  the  rise  of  our  moral  knowledge  of  Death 
and  the  Fall  that  besets  us  and  makes  us  doubt  our  own  worth.  Perhaps  it  is 
instead  our  unwillingness — reflected  in  Adam’s  shamed  hiding — to  walk  with 
God,  despite  our  fragility  and  propensity  for  evil. 

The  entire  Bible  is  structured  so  that  everything  after  the  Fall — the  history  of 
Israel,  the  prophets,  the  coming  of  Christ — is  presented  as  a  remedy  for  that  Fall, 
a  way  out  of  evil.  The  beginning  of  conscious  history,  the  rise  of  the  state  and  all 
its  pathologies  of  pride  and  rigidity,  the  emergence  of  great  moral  figures  who 
try  to  set  things  right,  culminating  in  the  Messiah  Himself — that  is  all  part  of 
humanity’s  attempt,  God  willing,  to  set  itself  right.  And  what  would  that  mean? 

And  this  is  an  amazing  thing:  the  answer  is  already  implicit  in  Genesis  1:  to 
embody  the  Image  of  God — to  speak  out  of  chaos  the  Being  that  is  Good — but  to 
do  so  consciously,  of  our  own  free  choice.  Back  is  the  way  forward — as  T.  S. 
Eliot  so  rightly  insisted — but  back  as  awake  beings,  exercising  the  proper  choice 
of  awake  beings,  instead  of  back  to  sleep: 

We  shall  not  cease  from  exploration 
And  the  end  of  all  our  exploring 
Will  be  to  arrive  where  we  started 
And  know  the  place  for  the  first  time. 

Through  the  unknown,  remembered  gate 
When  the  last  of  earth  left  to  discover 
Is  that  which  was  the  beginning; 


At  the  source  of  the  longest  river 
The  voice  of  the  hidden  waterfall 
And  the  children  in  the  apple-tree 

Not  known,  because  not  looked  for 
But  heard,  half-heard,  in  the  stillness 
Between  two  waves  of  the  sea. 

Quick  now,  here,  now,  always — 

A  condition  of  complete  simplicity 
(Costing  not  less  than  everything) 

And  all  shall  be  well  and 

All  manner  of  things  shall  be  well 

When  the  tongues  of  flames  are  in-folded 

Into  the  crowned  knot  of  fire 

And  the  fire  and  the  rose  are  one. 

(“Little  Gidding,”  Four  Quartets,  1943) 

If  we  wish  to  take  care  of  ourselves  properly,  we  would  have  to  respect  ourselves 
— but  we  don’t,  because  we  are — not  least  in  our  own  eyes — fallen  creatures.  If 
we  lived  in  Truth;  if  we  spoke  the  Truth — then  we  could  walk  with  God  once 
again,  and  respect  ourselves,  and  others,  and  the  world.  Then  we  might  treat 
ourselves  like  people  we  cared  for.  We  might  strive  to  set  the  world  straight.  We 
might  orient  it  toward  Heaven,  where  we  would  want  people  we  cared  for  to 
dwell,  instead  of  Hell,  where  our  resentment  and  hatred  would  eternally  sentence 
everyone. 

In  the  areas  where  Christianity  emerged  two  thousand  years  ago,  people  were 
much  more  barbaric  than  they  are  today.  Conflict  was  everywhere.  Human 
sacrifice,  including  that  of  children,  was  a  common  occurrence  even  in 
technologically  sophisticated  societies,  such  as  that  of  ancient  Carthage.  In 
Rome,  arena  sports  were  competitions  to  the  death,  and  the  spilling  of  blood  was 
a  commonplace.  The  probability  that  a  modern  person,  in  a  functional 
democratic  country,  will  now  kill  or  be  killed  is  infinitesimally  low  compared  to 
what  it  was  in  previous  societies  (and  still  is,  in  the  unorganized  and  anarchic 
parts  of  the  world).  Then,  the  primary  moral  issue  confronting  society  was 
control  of  violent,  impulsive  selfishness  and  the  mindless  greed  and  brutality  that 
accompanies  it.  People  with  those  aggressive  tendencies  still  exist.  At  least  now 
they  know  that  such  behaviour  is  sub-optimal,  and  either  try  to  control  it  or 
encounter  major  social  obstacles  if  they  don’t. 

But  now,  also,  another  problem  has  arisen,  which  was  perhaps  less  common  in 
our  harsher  past.  It  is  easy  to  believe  that  people  are  arrogant,  and  egotistical, 
and  always  looking  out  for  themselves.  The  cynicism  that  makes  that  opinion  a 
universal  truism  is  widespread  and  fashionable.  But  such  an  orientation  to  the 
world  is  not  at  all  characteristic  of  many  people.  They  have  the  opposite 
problem:  they  shoulder  intolerable  burdens  of  self-disgust,  self-contempt,  shame 


and  self-consciousness.  Thus,  instead  of  narcissistically  inflating  their  own 
importance,  they  don’t  value  themselves  at  all,  and  they  don’t  take  care  of 
themselves  with  attention  and  skill.  It  seems  that  people  often  don’t  really 
believe  that  they  deserve  the  best  care,  personally  speaking.  They  are 
excruciatingly  aware  of  their  own  faults  and  inadequacies,  real  and  exaggerated, 
and  ashamed  and  doubtful  of  their  own  value.  They  believe  that  other  people 
shouldn’t  suffer,  and  they  will  work  diligently  and  altruistically  to  help  them 
alleviate  it.  They  extend  the  same  courtesy  even  to  the  animals  they  are 
acquainted  with — but  not  so  easily  to  themselves. 

It  is  true  that  the  idea  of  virtuous  self-sacrifice  is  deeply  embedded  in  Western 
culture  (at  least  insofar  as  the  West  has  been  influenced  by  Christianity,  which  is 
based  on  the  imitation  of  someone  who  performed  the  ultimate  act  of  self- 
sacrifice).  Any  claim  that  the  Golden  Rule  does  not  mean  “sacrifice  yourself  for 
others”  might  therefore  appear  dubious.  But  Christ’s  archetypal  death  exists  as 
an  example  of  how  to  accept  finitude,  betrayal  and  tyranny  heroically — how  to 
walk  with  God  despite  the  tragedy  of  self-conscious  knowledge — and  not  as  a 
directive  to  victimize  ourselves  in  the  service  of  others.  To  sacrifice  ourselves  to 
God  (to  the  highest  good,  if  you  like)  does  not  mean  to  suffer  silently  and 
willingly  when  some  person  or  organization  demands  more  from  us, 
consistently,  than  is  offered  in  return.  That  means  we  are  supporting  tyranny,  and 
allowing  ourselves  to  be  treated  like  slaves.  It  is  not  virtuous  to  be  victimized  by 
a  bully,  even  if  that  bully  is  oneself. 

I  learned  two  very  important  lessons  from  Carl  Jung,  the  famous  Swiss  depth 
psychologist,  about  “doing  unto  others  as  you  would  have  them  do  unto  you”  or 
“loving  your  neighbour  as  yourself.”  The  first  lesson  was  that  neither  of  these 
statements  has  anything  to  do  with  being  nice.  The  second  was  that  both  are 
equations,  rather  than  injunctions.  If  I  am  someone’s  friend,  family  member,  or 
lover,  then  I  am  morally  obliged  to  bargain  as  hard  on  my  own  behalf  as  they  are 
on  theirs.  If  I  fail  to  do  so,  I  will  end  up  a  slave,  and  the  other  person  a  tyrant. 
What  good  is  that?  It  much  better  for  any  relationship  when  both  partners  are 
strong.  Furthermore,  there  is  little  difference  between  standing  up  and  speaking 
for  yourself,  when  you  are  being  bullied  or  otherwise  tormented  and  enslaved, 
and  standing  up  and  speaking  for  someone  else.  As  Jung  points  out,  this  means 
embracing  and  loving  the  sinner  who  is  yourself,  as  much  as  forgiving  and 
aiding  someone  else  who  is  stumbling  and  imperfect. 

As  God  himself  claims  (so  goes  the  story),  “Vengeance  is  mine;  I  will  repay, 
saith  the  Lord.”  According  to  this  philosophy,  you  do  not  simply  belong  to 
yourself.  You  are  not  simply  your  own  possession  to  torture  and  mistreat.  This  is 
partly  because  your  Being  is  inexorably  tied  up  with  that  of  others,  and  your 


mistreatment  of  yourself  can  have  catastrophic  consequences  for  others.  This  is 
most  clearly  evident,  perhaps,  in  the  aftermath  of  suicide,  when  those  left  behind 
are  often  both  bereft  and  traumatized.  But,  metaphorically  speaking,  there  is  also 
this:  you  have  a  spark  of  the  divine  in  you,  which  belongs  not  to  you,  but  to  God. 
We  are,  after  all — according  to  Genesis — made  in  His  image.  We  have  the  semi¬ 
divine  capacity  for  consciousness.  Our  consciousness  participates  in  the 
speaking  forth  of  Being.  We  are  low-resolution  (“kenotic”)  versions  of  God.  We 
can  make  order  from  chaos — and  vice  versa — in  our  way,  with  our  words.  So, 
we  may  not  exactly  be  God,  but  we’re  not  exactly  nothing,  either. 

In  my  own  periods  of  darkness,  in  the  underworld  of  the  soul,  I  find  myself 
frequently  overcome  and  amazed  by  the  ability  of  people  to  befriend  each  other, 
to  love  their  intimate  partners  and  parents  and  children,  and  to  do  what  they  must 
do  to  keep  the  machinery  of  the  world  running.  I  knew  a  man,  injured  and 
disabled  by  a  car  accident,  who  was  employed  by  a  local  utility.  For  years  after 
the  crash  he  worked  side  by  side  with  another  man,  who  for  his  part  suffered 
with  a  degenerative  neurological  disease.  They  cooperated  while  repairing  the 
lines,  each  making  up  for  the  other’s  inadequacy.  This  sort  of  everyday  heroism 
is  the  rule,  I  believe,  rather  than  the  exception.  Most  individuals  are  dealing  with 
one  or  more  serious  health  problems  while  going  productively  and 
uncomplainingly  about  their  business.  If  anyone  is  fortunate  enough  to  be  in  a 
rare  period  of  grace  and  health,  personally,  then  he  or  she  typically  has  at  least 
one  close  family  member  in  crisis.  Yet  people  prevail  and  continue  to  do  difficult 
and  effortful  tasks  to  hold  themselves  and  their  families  and  society  together.  To 
me  this  is  miraculous — so  much  so  that  a  dumbfounded  gratitude  is  the  only 
appropriate  response.  There  are  so  many  ways  that  things  can  fall  apart,  or  fail  to 
work  altogether,  and  it  is  always  wounded  people  who  are  holding  it  together. 
They  deserve  some  genuine  and  heartfelt  admiration  for  that.  It’s  an  ongoing 
miracle  of  fortitude  and  perseverance. 

In  my  clinical  practice  I  encourage  people  to  credit  themselves  and  those 
around  them  for  acting  productively  and  with  care,  as  well  as  for  the  genuine 
concern  and  thoughtfulness  they  manifest  towards  others.  People  are  so  tortured 
by  the  limitations  and  constraint  of  Being  that  I  am  amazed  they  ever  act 
properly  or  look  beyond  themselves  at  all.  But  enough  do  so  that  we  have  central 
heat  and  running  water  and  infinite  computational  power  and  electricity  and 
enough  for  everyone  to  eat  and  even  the  capacity  to  contemplate  the  fate  of 
broader  society  and  nature,  terrible  nature,  itself.  All  that  complex  machinery 
that  protects  us  from  freezing  and  starving  and  dying  from  lack  of  water  tends 
unceasingly  towards  malfunction  through  entropy,  and  it  is  only  the  constant 
attention  of  careful  people  that  keeps  it  working  so  unbelievably  well.  Some 


people  degenerate  into  the  hell  of  resentment  and  the  hatred  of  Being,  but  most 
refuse  to  do  so,  despite  their  suffering  and  disappointments  and  losses  and 
inadequacies  and  ugliness,  and  again  that  is  a  miracle  for  those  with  the  eyes  to 
see  it. 

Humanity,  in  toto,  and  those  who  compose  it  as  identifiable  people  deserve 
some  sympathy  for  the  appalling  burden  under  which  the  human  individual 
genuinely  staggers;  some  sympathy  for  subjugation  to  mortal  vulnerability, 
tyranny  of  the  state,  and  the  depredations  of  nature.  It  is  an  existential  situation 
that  no  mere  animal  encounters  or  endures,  and  one  of  severity  such  that  it 
would  take  a  God  to  fully  bear  it.  It  is  this  sympathy  that  should  be  the  proper 
medicament  for  self-conscious  self-contempt,  which  has  its  justification,  but  is 
only  half  the  full  and  proper  story.  Hatred  for  self  and  mankind  must  be  balanced 
with  gratefulness  for  tradition  and  the  state  and  astonishment  at  what  normal, 
everyday  people  accomplish — to  say  nothing  of  the  staggering  achievements  of 
the  truly  remarkable. 

We  deserve  some  respect.  You  deserve  some  respect.  You  are  important  to 
other  people,  as  much  as  to  yourself.  You  have  some  vital  role  to  play  in  the 
unfolding  destiny  of  the  world.  You  are,  therefore,  morally  obliged  to  take  care 
of  yourself.  You  should  take  care  of,  help  and  be  good  to  yourself  the  same  way 
you  would  take  care  of,  help  and  be  good  to  someone  you  loved  and  valued.  You 
may  therefore  have  to  conduct  yourself  habitually  in  a  manner  that  allows  you 
some  respect  for  your  own  Being — and  fair  enough.  But  every  person  is  deeply 
flawed.  Everyone  falls  short  of  the  glory  of  God.  If  that  stark  fact  meant, 
however,  that  we  had  no  responsibility  to  care,  for  ourselves  as  much  as  others, 
everyone  would  be  brutally  punished  all  the  time.  That  would  not  be  good.  That 
would  make  the  shortcomings  of  the  world,  which  can  make  everyone  who 
thinks  honestly  question  the  very  propriety  of  the  world,  worse  in  every  way. 
That  simply  cannot  be  the  proper  path  forward. 

To  treat  yourself  as  if  you  were  someone  you  are  responsible  for  helping  is, 
instead,  to  consider  what  would  be  truly  good  for  you.  This  is  not  “what  you 
want.”  It  is  also  not  “what  would  make  you  happy.”  Every  time  you  give  a  child 
something  sweet,  you  make  that  child  happy.  That  does  not  mean  that  you 
should  do  nothing  for  children  except  feed  them  candy.  “Happy”  is  by  no  means 
synonymous  with  “good.”  You  must  get  children  to  brush  their  teeth.  They  must 
put  on  their  snowsuits  when  they  go  outside  in  the  cold,  even  though  they  might 
object  strenuously.  You  must  help  a  child  become  a  virtuous,  responsible,  awake 
being,  capable  of  full  reciprocity — able  to  take  care  of  himself  and  others,  and  to 
thrive  while  doing  so.  Why  would  you  think  it  acceptable  to  do  anything  less  for 
yourself? 


You  need  to  consider  the  future  and  think,  “What  might  my  life  look  like  if  I 
were  caring  for  myself  properly?  What  career  would  challenge  me  and  render 
me  productive  and  helpful,  so  that  I  could  shoulder  my  share  of  the  load,  and 
enjoy  the  consequences?  What  should  I  be  doing,  when  I  have  some  freedom,  to 
improve  my  health,  expand  my  knowledge,  and  strengthen  my  body?”  You  need 
to  know  where  you  are,  so  you  can  start  to  chart  your  course.  You  need  to  know 
who  you  are,  so  that  you  understand  your  armament  and  bolster  yourself  in 
respect  to  your  limitations.  You  need  to  know  where  you  are  going,  so  that  you 
can  limit  the  extent  of  chaos  in  your  life,  restructure  order,  and  bring  the  divine 
force  of  Hope  to  bear  on  the  world. 

You  must  determine  where  you  are  going,  so  that  you  can  bargain  for  yourself, 
so  that  you  don’t  end  up  resentful,  vengeful  and  cruel.  You  have  to  articulate 
your  own  principles,  so  that  you  can  defend  yourself  against  others’  taking 
inappropriate  advantage  of  you,  and  so  that  you  are  secure  and  safe  while  you 
work  and  play.  You  must  discipline  yourself  carefully.  You  must  keep  the 
promises  you  make  to  yourself,  and  reward  yourself,  so  that  you  can  trust  and 
motivate  yourself.  You  need  to  determine  how  to  act  toward  yourself  so  that  you 
are  most  likely  to  become  and  to  stay  a  good  person.  It  would  be  good  to  make 
the  world  a  better  place.  Heaven,  after  all,  will  not  arrive  of  its  own  accord.  We 
will  have  to  work  to  bring  it  about,  and  strengthen  ourselves,  so  that  we  can 
withstand  the  deadly  angels  and  flaming  sword  of  judgment  that  God  used  to  bar 
its  entrance. 

Don’t  underestimate  the  power  of  vision  and  direction.  These  are  irresistible 
forces,  able  to  transform  what  might  appear  to  be  unconquerable  obstacles  into 
traversable  pathways  and  expanding  opportunities.  Strengthen  the  individual. 
Start  with  yourself.  Take  care  with  yourself.  Define  who  you  are.  Refine  your 
personality.  Choose  your  destination  and  articulate  your  Being.  As  the  great 
nineteenth-century  German  philosopher  Friedrich  Nietzsche  so  brilliantly  noted, 
“He  whose  life  has  a  why  can  bear  almost  any  how.”- 

You  could  help  direct  the  world,  on  its  careening  trajectory,  a  bit  more  toward 
Heaven  and  a  bit  more  away  from  Hell.  Once  having  understood  Hell, 
researched  it,  so  to  speak — particularly  your  own  individual  Hell — you  could 
decide  against  going  there  or  creating  that.  You  could  aim  elsewhere.  You  could, 
in  fact,  devote  your  life  to  this.  That  would  give  you  a  Meaning,  with  a  capital 
M.  That  would  justify  your  miserable  existence.  That  would  atone  for  your  sinful 
nature,  and  replace  your  shame  and  self-consciousness  with  the  natural  pride  and 
forthright  confidence  of  someone  who  has  learned  once  again  to  walk  with  God 
in  the  Garden. 

You  could  begin  by  treating  yourself  as  if  you  were  someone  you  were 


responsible  for  helping. 


RULE  3 


MAKE  FRIENDS  WITH  PEOPLE  WHO  WANT  THE  BEST 
FOR  YOU 

THE  OLD  HOMETOWN 

The  town  I  grew  up  in  had  been  scraped  only  fifty  years  earlier  out  of  the  endless 
flat  Northern  prairie.  Fairview,  Alberta,  was  part  of  the  frontier,  and  had  the 
cowboy  bars  to  prove  it.  The  Hudson’s  Bay  Co.  department  store  on  Main  Street 
still  bought  beaver,  wolf  and  coyote  furs  directly  from  the  local  trappers.  Three 
thousand  people  lived  there,  four  hundred  miles  away  from  the  nearest  city. 

Cable  TV,  video  games  and  internet  did  not  exist.  It  was  no  easy  matter  to  stay 
innocently  amused  in  Fairview,  particularly  during  the  five  months  of  winter, 
when  long  stretches  of  forty-below  days  and  even  colder  nights  were  the  norm. 

The  world  is  a  different  place  when  it’s  cold  like  that.  The  drunks  in  our  town 
ended  their  sad  lives  early.  They  passed  out  in  snowbanks  at  three  in  the  morning 
and  froze  to  death.  You  don’t  go  outside  casually  when  it’s  forty  below.  On  first 
breath,  the  arid  desert  air  constricts  your  lungs.  Ice  forms  on  your  eyelashes  and 
they  stick  together.  Long  hair,  wet  from  the  shower,  freezes  solid  and  then  stands 
on  end  wraith-like  of  its  own  accord  later  in  a  warm  house,  when  it  thaws  bone 
dry,  charged  with  electricity.  Children  only  put  their  tongues  on  steel  playground 
equipment  once.  Smoke  from  house  chimneys  doesn’t  rise.  Defeated  by  the  cold, 
it  drifts  downwards,  and  collects  like  fog  on  snow-covered  rooftops  and  yards. 
Cars  must  be  plugged  in  at  night,  their  engines  warmed  by  block  heaters,  or  oil 
will  not  flow  through  them  in  the  morning,  and  they  won’t  start.  Sometimes  they 
won’t  anyway.  Then  you  turn  the  engine  over  pointlessly  until  the  starter  clatters 
and  falls  silent.  Then  you  remove  the  frozen  battery  from  the  car,  loosening  bolts 
with  stiffening  fingers  in  the  intense  cold,  and  bring  it  into  the  house.  It  sits 
there,  sweating  for  hours,  until  it  warms  enough  to  hold  a  decent  charge.  You  are 
not  going  to  see  out  of  the  back  window  of  your  car,  either.  It  frosts  over  in 
November  and  stays  that  way  until  May.  Scraping  it  off  just  dampens  the 
upholstery.  Then  it’s  frozen,  too.  Late  one  night  going  to  visit  a  friend  I  sat  for 
two  hours  on  the  edge  of  the  passenger  seat  in  a  1970  Dodge  Challenger, 
jammed  up  against  the  stick-shift,  using  a  vodka-soaked  rag  to  keep  the  inside  of 
the  front  windshield  clear  in  front  of  the  driver  because  the  car  heater  had  quit. 
Stopping  wasn’t  an  option.  There  was  nowhere  to  stop. 


And  it  was  hell  on  house  cats.  Felines  in  Fairview  had  short  ears  and  tails 
because  they  had  lost  the  tips  of  both  to  frostbite.  They  came  to  resemble  Arctic 
foxes,  which  evolved  those  features  to  deal  proactively  with  the  intense  cold. 

One  day  our  cat  got  outside  and  no  one  noticed.  We  found  him,  later,  fur  frozen 
fast  to  the  cold  hard  backdoor  cement  steps  where  he  sat.  We  carefully  separated 
cat  from  concrete,  with  no  lasting  damage — except  to  his  pride.  Fairview  cats 
were  also  at  great  risk  in  the  winter  from  cars,  but  not  for  the  reasons  you  think. 

It  wasn’t  automobiles  sliding  on  icy  roads  and  running  them  over.  Only  loser 
cats  died  that  way.  It  was  cars  parked  immediately  after  being  driven  that  were 
dangerous.  A  frigid  cat  might  think  highly  of  climbing  up  under  such  a  vehicle 
and  sitting  on  its  still-warm  engine  block.  But  what  if  the  driver  decided  to  use 
the  car  again,  before  the  engine  cooled  down  and  cat  departed?  Let’s  just  say  that 
heat-seeking  house-pets  and  rapidly  rotating  radiator  fans  do  not  coexist  happily. 

Because  we  were  so  far  north,  the  bitterly  cold  winters  were  also  very  dark. 

By  December,  the  sun  didn’t  rise  until  9:30  a.m.  We  trudged  to  school  in  the 
pitch  black.  It  wasn’t  much  lighter  when  we  walked  home,  just  before  the  early 
sunset.  There  wasn’t  much  for  young  people  to  do  in  Fairview,  even  in  the 
summer.  But  the  winters  were  worse.  Then  your  friends  mattered.  More  than 
anything. 

My  Friend  Chris  and  His  Cousin 

I  had  a  friend  at  that  time.  We’ll  call  him  Chris.  He  was  a  smart  guy.  He  read  a 
lot.  He  liked  science  fiction  of  the  kind  I  was  attracted  to  (Bradbury,  Heinlein, 
Clarke).  He  was  inventive.  He  was  interested  in  electronic  kits  and  gears  and 
motors.  He  was  a  natural  engineer.  All  this  was  overshadowed,  however,  by 
something  that  had  gone  wrong  in  his  family.  I  don’t  know  what  it  was.  His 
sisters  were  smart  and  his  father  was  soft-spoken  and  his  mother  was  kind.  The 
girls  seemed  OK.  But  Chris  had  been  left  unattended  to  in  some  important  way. 
Despite  his  intelligence  and  curiosity  he  was  angry,  resentful  and  without  hope. 

All  this  manifested  itself  in  material  form  in  the  shape  of  his  1972  blue  Ford 
pickup  truck.  That  notorious  vehicle  had  at  least  one  dent  in  every  quarter  panel 
of  its  damaged  external  body.  Worse,  it  had  an  equivalent  number  of  dents 
inside.  Those  were  produced  by  the  impact  of  the  body  parts  of  friends  against 
the  internal  surfaces  during  the  continual  accidents  that  resulted  in  the  outer 
dents.  Chris’s  truck  was  the  exoskeleton  of  a  nihilist.  It  had  the  perfect  bumper 
sticker:  Be  Alert — The  World  Needs  More  Lerts.  The  irony  it  produced  in 
combination  with  the  dents  elevated  it  nicely  to  theatre  of  the  absurd.  Very  little 
of  that  was  (so  to  speak)  accidental. 


Every  time  Chris  crashed  his  truck,  his  father  would  fix  it,  and  buy  him 
something  else.  He  had  a  motorbike  and  a  van  for  selling  ice  cream.  He  did  not 
care  for  his  motorbike.  He  sold  no  ice  cream.  He  often  expressed  dissatisfaction 
with  his  father  and  their  relationship.  But  his  dad  was  older  and  unwell, 
diagnosed  with  an  illness  only  after  many  years.  He  didn’t  have  the  energy  he 
should  have.  Maybe  he  couldn’t  pay  enough  attention  to  his  son.  Maybe  that’s  all 
it  took  to  fracture  their  relationship. 

Chris  had  a  cousin,  Ed,  who  was  about  two  years  younger.  I  liked  him,  as 
much  as  you  can  like  the  younger  cousin  of  a  teenage  friend.  He  was  a  tall, 
smart,  charming,  good-looking  kid.  He  was  witty,  too.  You  would  have  predicted 
a  good  future  for  him,  had  you  met  him  when  he  was  twelve.  But  Ed  drifted 
slowly  downhill,  into  a  dropout,  semi-drifting  mode  of  existence.  He  didn’t  get 
as  angry  as  Chris,  but  he  was  just  as  confused.  If  you  knew  Ed’s  friends,  you 
might  say  that  it  was  peer  pressure  that  set  him  on  his  downward  path.  But  his 
peers  weren’t  obviously  any  more  lost  or  delinquent  than  he  was,  although  they 
were  generally  somewhat  less  bright.  It  was  also  the  case  that  Ed’s — and  Chris’s 
— situation  did  not  appear  particularly  improved  by  their  discovery  of  marijuana. 
Marijuana  isn’t  bad  for  everyone  any  more  than  alcohol  is  bad  for  everyone. 
Sometimes  it  even  appears  to  improve  people.  But  it  didn’t  improve  Ed.  It  didn’t 
improve  Chris,  either. 

To  amuse  ourselves  in  the  long  nights,  Chris  and  I  and  Ed  and  the  rest  of  the 
teenagers  drove  around  and  around  in  our  1970s  cars  and  pickup  trucks.  We 
cruised  down  Main  Street,  along  Railroad  Avenue,  up  past  the  high  school, 
around  the  north  end  of  town,  over  to  the  west — or  up  Main  Street,  around  the 
north  end  of  town,  over  to  the  east — and  so  on,  endlessly  repeating  the  theme.  If 
we  weren’t  driving  in  town,  we  were  driving  in  the  countryside.  A  century 
earlier,  surveyors  had  laid  out  a  vast  grid  across  the  entire  three-hundred- 
thousand-square-mile  expanse  of  the  great  western  prairie.  Every  two  miles 
north,  a  plowed  gravel  road  stretched  forever,  east  to  west.  Every  mile  west, 
another  travelled  north  and  south.  We  never  ran  out  of  roads. 

Teenage  Wasteland 

If  we  weren’t  circling  around  town  and  countryside  we  were  at  a  party.  Some 
relatively  young  adult  (or  some  relatively  creepy  older  adult)  would  open  his 
house  to  friends.  It  would  then  become  temporary  home  to  all  manner  of  party 
crashers,  many  of  whom  started  out  seriously  undesirable  or  quickly  become  that 
way  when  drinking.  A  party  might  also  happen  accidentally,  when  some 
teenager’s  unwitting  parents  had  left  town.  In  that  case,  the  occupants  of  the  cars 


or  trucks  always  cruising  around  would  notice  house  lights  on,  but  household  car 
absent.  This  was  not  good.  Things  could  get  seriously  out  of  hand. 

I  did  not  like  teenage  parties.  I  do  not  remember  them  nostalgically.  They 
were  dismal  affairs.  The  lights  were  kept  low.  That  kept  self-consciousness  to  a 
minimum.  The  over-loud  music  made  conversation  impossible.  There  was  little 
to  talk  about  in  any  case.  There  were  always  a  couple  of  the  town  psychopaths 
attending.  Everybody  drank  and  smoked  too  much.  A  dreary  and  oppressive 
sense  of  aimlessness  hung  over  such  occasions,  and  nothing  ever  happened 
(unless  you  count  the  time  my  too-quiet  classmate  drunkenly  began  to  brandish 
his  fully-loaded  12-gauge  shotgun,  or  the  time  the  girl  I  later  married 
contemptuously  insulted  someone  while  he  threatened  her  with  a  knife,  or  the 
time  another  friend  climbed  a  large  tree,  swung  out  on  a  branch,  and  crashed  flat 
onto  his  back,  half  dead  right  beside  the  campfire  we  had  started  at  its  base, 
followed  precisely  one  minute  later  by  his  halfwit  sidekick). 

No  one  knew  what  the  hell  they  were  doing  at  those  parties.  Hoping  for  a 
cheerleader?  Waiting  for  Godot?  Although  the  former  would  have  been 
immediately  preferred  (although  cheerleading  squads  were  scarce  in  our  town), 
the  latter  was  closer  to  the  truth.  It  would  be  more  romantic,  I  suppose,  to 
suggest  that  we  would  have  all  jumped  at  the  chance  for  something  more 
productive,  bored  out  of  our  skulls  as  we  were.  But  it’s  not  true.  We  were  all  too 
prematurely  cynical  and  world-weary  and  leery  of  responsibility  to  stick  to  the 
debating  clubs  and  Air  Cadets  and  school  sports  that  the  adults  around  us  tried  to 
organize.  Doing  anything  wasn’t  cool.  I  don’t  know  what  teenage  life  was  like 
before  the  revolutionaries  of  the  late  sixties  advised  everyone  young  to  tune  in, 
turn  on  and  drop  out.  Was  it  OK  for  a  teenager  to  belong  wholeheartedly  to  a 
club  in  1955?  Because  it  certainly  wasn’t  twenty  years  later.  Plenty  of  us  turned 
on  and  dropped  out.  But  not  so  many  tuned  in. 

I  wanted  to  be  elsewhere.  I  wasn’t  the  only  one.  Everyone  who  eventually  left 
the  Fairview  I  grew  up  in  knew  they  were  leaving  by  the  age  of  twelve.  I  knew. 
My  wife,  who  grew  up  with  me  on  the  street  our  families  shared,  knew.  The 
friends  I  had  who  did  and  didn’t  leave  also  knew,  regardless  of  which  track  they 
were  on.  There  was  an  unspoken  expectation  in  the  families  of  those  who  were 
college-bound  that  such  a  thing  was  a  matter  of  course.  For  those  from  less- 
educated  families,  a  future  that  included  university  was  simply  not  part  of  the 
conceptual  realm.  It  wasn’t  for  lack  of  money,  either.  Tuition  for  advanced 
education  was  very  low  at  that  time,  and  jobs  in  Alberta  were  plentiful  and  high- 
paying.  I  earned  more  money  in  1980  working  at  a  plywood  mill  than  I  would 
again  doing  anything  else  for  twenty  years.  No  one  missed  out  on  university 
because  of  financial  need  in  oil-rich  Alberta  in  the  1970s. 


Some  Different  Friends — and  Some  More  of  the  Same 

In  high  school,  after  my  first  group  of  cronies  had  all  dropped  out,  I  made 
friends  with  a  couple  of  newcomers.  They  came  to  Fairview  as  boarders.  There 
was  no  school  after  ninth  grade  in  their  even  more  remote  and  aptly  named 
hometown,  Bear  Canyon.  They  were  an  ambitious  duo,  comparatively  speaking; 
straightforward  and  reliable,  but  also  cool  and  very  amusing.  When  I  left  town  to 
attend  Grande  Prairie  Regional  College,  ninety  miles  away,  one  of  them  became 
my  roommate.  The  other  went  off  elsewhere  to  pursue  further  education.  Both 
were  aiming  upward.  Their  decisions  to  do  so  bolstered  mine. 

I  was  a  happy  clam  when  I  arrived  at  college.  I  found  another,  expanded  group 
of  like-minded  companions,  whom  my  Bear  Canyon  comrade  also  joined.  We 
were  all  captivated  by  literature  and  philosophy.  We  ran  the  Student  Union.  We 
made  it  profitable,  for  the  first  time  in  its  history,  hosting  college  dances.  How 
can  you  lose  money  selling  beer  to  college  kids?  We  started  a  newspaper.  We  got 
to  know  our  professors  of  political  science  and  biology  and  English  literature  in 
the  tiny  seminars  that  characterized  even  our  first  year.  The  instructors  were 
thankful  for  our  enthusiasm  and  taught  us  well.  We  were  building  a  better  life. 

I  sloughed  off  a  lot  of  my  past.  In  a  small  town,  everyone  knows  who  you  are. 
You  drag  your  years  behind  you  like  a  running  dog  with  tin  cans  tied  to  its  tail. 
You  can’t  escape  who  you  have  been.  Everything  wasn’t  online  then,  and  thank 
God  for  that,  but  it  was  stored  equally  indelibly  in  everyone’s  spoken  and 
unspoken  expectations  and  memory. 

When  you  move,  everything  is  up  in  the  air,  at  least  for  a  while.  It’s  stressful, 
but  in  the  chaos  there  are  new  possibilities.  People,  including  you,  can’t  hem  you 
in  with  their  old  notions.  You  get  shaken  out  of  your  ruts.  You  can  make  new, 
better  ruts,  with  people  aiming  at  better  things.  I  thought  this  was  just  a  natural 
development.  I  thought  that  every  person  who  moved  would  have — and  want — 
the  same  phoenix-like  experience.  But  that  wasn’t  always  the  case. 

One  time,  when  I  was  about  fifteen,  I  went  with  Chris  and  another  friend, 

Carl,  to  Edmonton,  a  city  of  six  hundred  thousand.  Carl  had  never  been  to  a  city. 
This  was  not  uncommon.  Fairview  to  Edmonton  was  an  eight-hundred-mile 
round  trip.  I  had  done  it  many  times,  sometimes  with  my  parents,  sometimes 
without.  I  liked  the  anonymity  that  the  city  provided.  I  liked  the  new  beginnings. 
I  liked  the  escape  from  the  dismal,  cramped  adolescent  culture  of  my  home 
town.  So,  I  convinced  my  two  friends  to  make  the  journey.  But  they  did  not  have 
the  same  experience.  As  soon  as  we  arrived,  Chris  and  Carl  wanted  to  buy  some 
pot.  We  headed  for  the  parts  of  Edmonton  that  were  exactly  like  the  worst  of 
Fairview.  We  found  the  same  furtive  street-vending  marijuana  providers.  We 


spent  the  weekend  drinking  in  the  hotel  room.  Although  we  had  travelled  a  long 
distance,  we  had  gone  nowhere  at  all. 

I  saw  an  even  more  egregious  example  of  this  a  few  years  later.  I  had  moved 
to  Edmonton  to  finish  my  undergraduate  degree.  I  took  an  apartment  with  my 
sister,  who  was  studying  to  be  a  nurse.  She  was  also  an  up-and-out-of-there 
person.  (Not  too  many  years  later  she  would  plant  strawberries  in  Norway  and 
run  safaris  through  Africa  and  smuggle  trucks  across  the  Tuareg-menaced  Sahara 
Desert,  and  babysit  orphan  gorillas  in  the  Congo.)  We  had  a  nice  place  in  a  new 
high-rise,  overlooking  the  broad  valley  of  the  North  Saskatchewan  River.  We 
had  a  view  of  the  city  skyline  in  the  background.  I  bought  a  beautiful  new 
Yamaha  upright  piano,  in  a  fit  of  enthusiasm.  The  place  looked  good. 

I  heard  through  the  grapevine  that  Ed — Chris’s  younger  cousin — had  moved 
to  the  city.  I  thought  that  was  a  good  thing.  One  day  he  called.  I  invited  him  over. 
I  wanted  to  see  how  he  was  faring.  I  hoped  he  was  achieving  some  of  the 
potential  I  once  saw  in  him.  That  is  not  what  happened.  Ed  showed  up,  older, 
balder  and  stooped.  He  was  a  lot  more  not-doing-so-well  young  adult  and  a  lot 
less  youthful  possibility.  His  eyes  were  the  telltale  red  slits  of  the  practised 
stoner.  Ed  had  had  taken  some  job — lawn-mowing  and  casual  landscaping — 
which  would  have  been  fine  for  a  part-time  university  student  or  for  someone 
who  could  not  do  better  but  which  was  wretchedly  low-end  as  a  career  for  an 
intelligent  person. 

He  was  accompanied  by  a  friend. 

It  was  his  friend  I  really  remember.  He  was  spaced.  He  was  baked.  He  was 
stoned  out  of  his  gourd.  His  head  and  our  nice,  civilized  apartment  did  not  easily 
occupy  the  same  universe.  My  sister  was  there.  She  knew  Ed.  She’d  seen  this 
sort  of  thing  before.  But  I  still  wasn’t  happy  that  Ed  had  brought  this  character 
into  our  place.  Ed  sat  down.  His  friend  sat  down,  too,  although  it  wasn’t  clear  he 
noticed.  It  was  tragicomedy.  Stoned  as  he  was,  Ed  still  had  the  sense  to  be 
embarrassed.  We  sipped  our  beer.  Ed’s  friend  looked  upwards.  “My  particles  are 
scattered  all  over  the  ceiling,”  he  managed.  Truer  words  were  never  spoken. 

I  took  Ed  aside  and  told  him  politely  that  he  had  to  leave.  I  said  that  he 
shouldn’t  have  brought  his  useless  bastard  of  a  companion.  He  nodded.  He 
understood.  That  made  it  even  worse.  His  older  cousin  Chris  wrote  me  a  letter 
much  later  about  such  things.  I  included  it  in  my  first  book,  Maps  of  Meaning: 
The  Architecture  of  Belief,  published  in  1999:  “I  had  friends,”  he  said.  “Before. 
Anyone  with  enough  self-contempt  that  they  could  forgive  me  mine.” 

What  was  it  that  made  Chris  and  Carl  and  Ed  unable  (or,  worse,  perhaps, 
unwilling)  to  move  or  to  change  their  friendships  and  improve  the  circumstances 
of  their  lives?  Was  it  inevitable — a  consequence  of  their  own  limitations,  nascent 


illnesses  and  traumas  of  the  past?  After  all,  people  vary  significantly,  in  ways 
that  seem  both  structural  and  deterministic.  People  differ  in  intelligence,  which  is 
in  large  part  the  ability  to  learn  and  transform.  People  have  very  different 
personalities,  as  well.  Some  are  active,  and  some  passive.  Others  are  anxious  or 
calm.  For  every  individual  driven  to  achieve,  there  is  another  who  is  indolent. 
The  degree  to  which  these  differences  are  immutably  part  and  parcel  of  someone 
is  greater  than  an  optimist  might  presume  or  desire.  And  then  there  is  illness, 
mental  and  physical,  diagnosed  or  invisible,  further  limiting  or  shaping  our  lives. 

Chris  had  a  psychotic  break  in  his  thirties,  after  flirting  with  insanity  for  many 
years.  Not  long  afterward,  he  committed  suicide.  Did  his  heavy  marijuana  use 
play  a  magnifying  role,  or  was  it  understandable  self-medication?  Use  of 
physician-prescribed  drugs  for  pain  has,  after  all,  decreased  in  marijuana-legal 
states  such  as  Colorado.  Maybe  the  pot  made  things  better  for  Chris,  not 
worse.  Maybe  it  eased  his  suffering,  instead  of  exacerbating  his  instability.  Was 
it  the  nihilistic  philosophy  he  nurtured  that  paved  the  way  to  his  eventual 
breakdown?  Was  that  nihilism,  in  turn,  a  consequence  of  genuine  ill  health,  or 
just  an  intellectual  rationalization  of  his  unwillingness  to  dive  responsibly  into 
life?  Why  did  he — like  his  cousin,  like  my  other  friends — continually  choose 
people  who,  and  places  that,  were  not  good  for  him? 

Sometimes,  when  people  have  a  low  opinion  of  their  own  worth — or,  perhaps, 
when  they  refuse  responsibility  for  their  lives — they  choose  a  new  acquaintance, 
of  precisely  the  type  who  proved  troublesome  in  the  past.  Such  people  don’t 
believe  that  they  deserve  any  better — so  they  don’t  go  looking  for  it.  Or,  perhaps, 
they  don’t  want  the  trouble  of  better.  Freud  called  this  a  “repetition  compulsion.” 
He  thought  of  it  as  an  unconscious  drive  to  repeat  the  horrors  of  the  past — 
sometimes,  perhaps,  to  formulate  those  horrors  more  precisely,  sometimes  to 
attempt  more  active  mastery  and  sometimes,  perhaps,  because  no  alternatives 
beckon.  People  create  their  worlds  with  the  tools  they  have  directly  at  hand. 
Faulty  tools  produce  faulty  results.  Repeated  use  of  the  same  faulty  tools 
produces  the  same  faulty  results.  It  is  in  this  manner  that  those  who  fail  to  learn 
from  the  past  doom  themselves  to  repeat  it.  It’s  partly  fate.  It’s  partly  inability. 

It’s  partly  . . .  unwillingness  to  learn?  Refusal  to  learn?  Motivated  refusal  to 
learn? 

Rescuing  the  Damned 

People  choose  friends  who  aren’t  good  for  them  for  other  reasons,  too. 
Sometimes  it’s  because  they  want  to  rescue  someone.  This  is  more  typical  of 
young  people,  although  the  impetus  still  exists  among  older  folks  who  are  too 


agreeable  or  have  remained  naive  or  who  are  willfully  blind.  Someone  might 
object,  “It  is  only  right  to  see  the  best  in  people.  The  highest  virtue  is  the  desire 
to  help.”  But  not  everyone  who  is  failing  is  a  victim,  and  not  everyone  at  the 
bottom  wishes  to  rise,  although  many  do,  and  many  manage  it.  Nonetheless, 
people  will  often  accept  or  even  amplify  their  own  suffering,  as  well  as  that  of 
others,  if  they  can  brandish  it  as  evidence  of  the  world’s  injustice.  There  is  no 
shortage  of  oppressors  among  the  downtrodden,  even  if,  given  their  lowly 
positions,  many  of  them  are  only  tyrannical  wannabes.  It’s  the  easiest  path  to 
choose,  moment  to  moment,  although  it’s  nothing  but  hell  in  the  long  run. 

Imagine  someone  not  doing  well.  He  needs  help.  He  might  even  want  it.  But  it 
is  not  easy  to  distinguish  between  someone  truly  wanting  and  needing  help  and 
someone  who  is  merely  exploiting  a  willing  helper.  The  distinction  is  difficult 
even  for  the  person  who  is  wanting  and  needing  and  possibly  exploiting.  The 
person  who  tries  and  fails,  and  is  forgiven,  and  then  tries  again  and  fails,  and  is 
forgiven,  is  also  too  often  the  person  who  wants  everyone  to  believe  in  the 
authenticity  of  all  that  trying. 

When  it’s  not  just  naivete,  the  attempt  to  rescue  someone  is  often  fuelled  by 
vanity  and  narcissism.  Something  like  this  is  detailed  in  the  incomparable 
Russian  author  Fyodor  Dostoevsky’s  bitter  classic,  Notes  from  Underground, 
which  begins  with  these  famous  lines:  “I  am  a  sick  man  ...  I  am  a  spiteful  man.  I 
am  an  unattractive  man.  I  believe  my  liver  is  diseased.”  It  is  the  confession  of  a 
miserable,  arrogant  sojourner  in  the  underworld  of  chaos  and  despair.  He 
analyzes  himself  mercilessly,  but  only  pays  in  this  manner  for  a  hundred  sins, 
despite  committing  a  thousand.  Then,  imagining  himself  redeemed,  the 
underground  man  commits  the  worst  transgression  of  the  lot.  He  offers  aid  to  a 
genuinely  unfortunate  person,  Liza,  a  woman  on  the  desperate  nineteenth- 
century  road  to  prostitution.  He  invites  her  for  a  visit,  promising  to  set  her  life 
back  on  the  proper  course.  While  waiting  for  her  to  appear,  his  fantasies  spin 
increasingly  messianic: 

One  day  passed,  however,  another  and  another;  she  did  not  come  and  I  began  to  grow  calmer.  I 
felt  particularly  bold  and  cheerful  after  nine  o’clock,  I  even  sometimes  began  dreaming,  and 
rather  sweetly:  I,  for  instance,  became  the  salvation  of  Liza,  simply  through  her  coming  to  me 
and  my  talking  to  her.. . .  I  develop  her,  educate  her.  Finally,  I  notice  that  she  loves  me,  loves  me 
passionately.  I  pretend  not  to  understand  (I  don’t  know,  however,  why  I  pretend,  just  for  effect, 
perhaps).  At  last  all  confusion,  transfigured,  trembling  and  sobbing,  she  flings  herself  at  my  feet 
and  says  that  I  am  her  savior,  and  that  she  loves  me  better  than  anything  in  the  world. 

Nothing  but  the  narcissism  of  the  underground  man  is  nourished  by  such 
fantasies.  Liza  herself  is  demolished  by  them.  The  salvation  he  offers  to  her 
demands  far  more  in  the  way  of  commitment  and  maturity  than  the  underground 
man  is  willing  or  able  to  offer.  He  simply  does  not  have  the  character  to  see  it 


through — something  he  quickly  realizes,  and  equally  quickly  rationalizes.  Liza 
eventually  arrives  at  his  shabby  apartment,  hoping  desperately  for  a  way  out, 
staking  everything  she  has  on  the  visit.  She  tells  the  underground  man  that  she 
wants  to  leave  her  current  life.  His  response? 

“Why  have  you  come  to  me,  tell  me  that,  please?”  I  began,  gasping  for  breath  and  regardless  of 
logical  connection  in  my  words.  I  longed  to  have  it  all  out  at  once,  at  one  burst;  I  did  not  even 
trouble  how  to  begin.  “Why  have  you  come?  Answer,  answer,”  I  cried,  hardly  knowing  what  I 
was  doing.  “I’ll  tell  you,  my  good  girl,  why  you  have  come.  You’ve  come  because  I  talked 
sentimental  stuff  to  you  then.  So  now  you  are  soft  as  butter  and  longing  for  fine  sentiments 
again.  So  you  may  as  well  know  that  I  was  laughing  at  you  then.  And  I  am  laughing  at  you  now. 

Why  are  you  shuddering?  Yes,  I  was  laughing  at  you!  I  had  been  insulted  just  before,  at  dinner, 
by  the  fellows  who  came  that  evening  before  me.  I  came  to  you,  meaning  to  thrash  one  of  them, 
an  officer;  but  I  didn’t  succeed,  I  didn’t  find  him;  I  had  to  avenge  the  insult  on  someone  to  get 
back  my  own  again;  you  turned  up,  I  vented  my  spleen  on  you  and  laughed  at  you.  I  had  been 
humiliated,  so  I  wanted  to  humiliate;  I  had  been  treated  like  a  rag,  so  I  wanted  to  show  my 
power. . . .  That’s  what  it  was,  and  you  imagined  I  had  come  there  on  purpose  to  save  you.  Yes? 

You  imagined  that?  You  imagined  that?” 

I  knew  that  she  would  perhaps  be  muddled  and  not  take  it  all  in  exactly,  but  I  knew,  too,  that 
she  would  grasp  the  gist  of  it,  very  well  indeed.  And  so,  indeed,  she  did.  She  turned  white  as  a 
handkerchief,  tried  to  say  something,  and  her  lips  worked  painfully;  but  she  sank  on  a  chair  as 
though  she  had  been  felled  by  an  axe.  And  all  the  time  afterwards  she  listened  to  me  with  her 
lips  parted  and  her  eyes  wide  open,  shuddering  with  awful  terror.  The  cynicism,  the  cynicism  of 
my  words  overwhelmed  her. . . . 

The  inflated  self-importance,  carelessness  and  sheer  malevolence  of  the 
underground  man  dashes  Liza’s  last  hopes.  He  understands  this  well.  Worse: 
something  in  him  was  aiming  at  this  all  along.  And  he  knows  that  too.  But  a 
villain  who  despairs  of  his  villainy  has  not  become  a  hero.  A  hero  is  something 
positive,  not  just  the  absence  of  evil. 

But  Christ  himself,  you  might  object,  befriended  tax-collectors  and  prostitutes. 
How  dare  I  cast  aspersions  on  the  motives  of  those  who  are  trying  to  help?  But 
Christ  was  the  archetypal  perfect  man.  And  you’re  you.  How  do  you  know  that 
your  attempts  to  pull  someone  up  won’t  instead  bring  them — or  you — further 
down?  Imagine  the  case  of  someone  supervising  an  exceptional  team  of  workers, 
all  of  them  striving  towards  a  collectively  held  goal;  imagine  them  hard¬ 
working,  brilliant,  creative  and  unified.  But  the  person  supervising  is  also 
responsible  for  someone  troubled,  who  is  performing  poorly,  elsewhere.  In  a  fit 
of  inspiration,  the  well-meaning  manager  moves  that  problematic  person  into  the 
midst  of  his  stellar  team,  hoping  to  improve  him  by  example.  What  happens? — 
and  the  psychological  literature  is  clear  on  this  point.  Does  the  errant  interloper 
immediately  straighten  up  and  fly  right?  No.  Instead,  the  entire  team 
degenerates.  The  newcomer  remains  cynical,  arrogant  and  neurotic.  He 
complains.  He  shirks.  He  misses  important  meetings.  His  low-quality  work 
causes  delays,  and  must  be  redone  by  others.  He  still  gets  paid,  however,  just  like 


his  teammates.  The  hard  workers  who  surround  him  start  to  feel  betrayed.  “Why 
am  I  breaking  myself  into  pieces  striving  to  finish  this  project,”  each  thinks, 
“when  my  new  team  member  never  breaks  a  sweat?”  The  same  thing  happens 
when  well-meaning  counsellors  place  a  delinquent  teen  among  comparatively 
civilized  peers.  The  delinquency  spreads,  not  the  stability.  Down  is  a  lot  easier 
than  up. 

Maybe  you  are  saving  someone  because  you’re  a  strong,  generous,  well-put- 
together  person  who  wants  to  do  the  right  thing.  But  it’s  also  possible — and, 
perhaps,  more  likely — that  you  just  want  to  draw  attention  to  your  inexhaustible 
reserves  of  compassion  and  good-will.  Or  maybe  you’re  saving  someone 
because  you  want  to  convince  yourself  that  the  strength  of  your  character  is 
more  than  just  a  side  effect  of  your  luck  and  birthplace.  Or  maybe  it’s  because 
it’s  easier  to  look  virtuous  when  standing  alongside  someone  utterly 
irresponsible. 

Assume  first  that  you  are  doing  the  easiest  thing,  and  not  the  most  difficult. 

Your  raging  alcoholism  makes  my  binge  drinking  appear  trivial.  My  long 
serious  talks  with  you  about  your  badly  failing  marriage  convince  both  of  us  that 
you  are  doing  everything  possible  and  that  I  am  helping  you  to  my  utmost.  It 
looks  like  effort.  It  looks  like  progress.  But  real  improvement  would  require  far 
more  from  both  of  you.  Are  you  so  sure  the  person  crying  out  to  be  saved  has  not 
decided  a  thousand  times  to  accept  his  lot  of  pointless  and  worsening  suffering, 
simply  because  it  is  easier  than  shouldering  any  true  responsibility?  Are  you 
enabling  a  delusion?  Is  it  possible  that  your  contempt  would  be  more  salutary 
than  your  pity? 

Or  maybe  you  have  no  plan,  genuine  or  otherwise,  to  rescue  anybody.  You’re 
associating  with  people  who  are  bad  for  you  not  because  it’s  better  for  anyone, 
but  because  it’s  easier.  You  know  it.  Your  friends  know  it.  You’re  all  bound  by 
an  implicit  contract — one  aimed  at  nihilism,  and  failure,  and  suffering  of  the 
stupidest  sort.  You’ve  all  decided  to  sacrifice  the  future  to  the  present.  You  don’t 
talk  about  it.  You  don’t  all  get  together  and  say,  “Let’s  take  the  easier  path.  Let’s 
indulge  in  whatever  the  moment  might  bring.  And  let’s  agree,  further,  not  to  call 
each  other  on  it.  That  way,  we  can  more  easily  forget  what  we  are  doing.”  You 
don’t  mention  any  of  that.  But  you  all  know  what’s  really  going  on. 

Before  you  help  someone,  you  should  find  out  why  that  person  is  in  trouble. 
You  shouldn’t  merely  assume  that  he  or  she  is  a  noble  victim  of  unjust 
circumstances  and  exploitation.  It’s  the  most  unlikely  explanation,  not  the  most 
probable.  In  my  experience — clinical  and  otherwise — it’s  just  never  been  that 
simple.  Besides,  if  you  buy  the  story  that  everything  terrible  just  happened  on  its 
own,  with  no  personal  responsibility  on  the  part  of  the  victim,  you  deny  that 


person  all  agency  in  the  past  (and,  by  implication,  in  the  present  and  future,  as 
well).  In  this  manner,  you  strip  him  or  her  of  all  power. 

It  is  far  more  likely  that  a  given  individual  has  just  decided  to  reject  the  path 
upward,  because  of  its  difficulty.  Perhaps  that  should  even  be  your  default 
assumption,  when  faced  with  such  a  situation.  That’s  too  harsh,  you  think.  You 
might  be  right.  Maybe  that’s  a  step  too  far.  But  consider  this:  failure  is  easy  to 
understand.  No  explanation  for  its  existence  is  required.  In  the  same  manner, 
fear,  hatred,  addiction,  promiscuity,  betrayal  and  deception  require  no 
explanation.  It’s  not  the  existence  of  vice,  or  the  indulgence  in  it,  that  requires 
explanation.  Vice  is  easy.  Failure  is  easy,  too.  It’s  easier  not  to  shoulder  a  burden. 
It’s  easier  not  to  think,  and  not  to  do,  and  not  to  care.  It’s  easier  to  put  off  until 
tomorrow  what  needs  to  be  done  today,  and  drown  the  upcoming  months  and 
years  in  today’s  cheap  pleasures.  As  the  infamous  father  of  the  Simpson  clan 
puts  it,  immediately  prior  to  downing  a  jar  of  mayonnaise  and  vodka,  “That’s  a 
problem  for  Future  Homer.  Man,  I  don’t  envy  that  guy!” 

How  do  I  know  that  your  suffering  is  not  the  demand  of  martyrdom  for  my 
resources,  so  that  you  can  oh-so-momentarily  stave  off  the  inevitable?  Maybe 
you  have  even  moved  beyond  caring  about  the  impending  collapse,  but  don’t  yet 
want  to  admit  it.  Maybe  my  help  won’t  rectify  anything — can’t  rectify  anything 
— but  it  does  keep  that  too-terrible,  too-personal  realization  temporarily  at  bay. 
Maybe  your  misery  is  a  demand  placed  on  me  so  that  I  fail  too,  so  that  the  gap 
you  so  painfully  feel  between  us  can  be  reduced,  while  you  degenerate  and  sink. 
How  do  I  know  that  you  would  refuse  to  play  such  a  game?  How  do  I  know  that 
I  am  not  myself  merely  pretending  to  be  responsible,  while  pointlessly  “helping” 
you,  so  that  /  don’t  have  to  do  something  truly  difficult — and  genuinely 
possible? 

Maybe  your  misery  is  the  weapon  you  brandish  in  your  hatred  for  those  who 
rose  upward  while  you  waited  and  sank.  Maybe  your  misery  is  your  attempt  to 
prove  the  world’s  injustice,  instead  of  the  evidence  of  your  own  sin,  your  own 
missing  of  the  mark,  your  conscious  refusal  to  strive  and  to  live.  Maybe  your 
willingness  to  suffer  in  failure  is  inexhaustible,  given  what  you  use  that  suffering 
to  prove.  Maybe  it’s  your  revenge  on  Being.  How  exactly  should  I  befriend  you 
when  you’re  in  such  a  place?  How  exactly  could  I? 

Success:  that’s  the  mystery.  Virtue:  that’s  what’s  inexplicable.  To  fail,  you 
merely  have  to  cultivate  a  few  bad  habits.  You  just  have  to  bide  your  time.  And 
once  someone  has  spent  enough  time  cultivating  bad  habits  and  biding  their 
time,  they  are  much  diminished.  Much  of  what  they  could  have  been  has 
dissipated,  and  much  of  the  less  that  they  have  become  is  now  real.  Things  fall 


apart,  of  their  own  accord,  but  the  sins  of  men  speed  their  degeneration.  And 
then  comes  the  flood. 

I  am  not  saying  that  there  is  no  hope  of  redemption.  But  it  is  much  harder  to 
extract  someone  from  a  chasm  than  to  lift  him  from  a  ditch.  And  some  chasms 
are  very  deep.  And  there’s  not  much  left  of  the  body  at  the  bottom. 

Maybe  I  should  at  least  wait,  to  help  you,  until  it’s  clear  that  you  want  to  be 
helped.  Carl  Rogers,  the  famous  humanistic  psychologist,  believed  it  was 
impossible  to  start  a  therapeutic  relationship  if  the  person  seeking  help  did  not 
want  to  improve.  Rogers  believed  it  was  impossible  to  convince  someone  to 
change  for  the  better.  The  desire  to  improve  was,  instead,  the  precondition  for 
progress.  I’ve  had  court-mandated  psychotherapy  clients.  They  did  not  want  my 
help.  They  were  forced  to  seek  it.  It  did  not  work.  It  was  a  travesty. 

If  I  stay  in  an  unhealthy  relationship  with  you,  perhaps  it’s  because  I’m  too 
weak-willed  and  indecisive  to  leave,  but  I  don’t  want  to  know  it.  Thus,  I 
continue  helping  you,  and  console  myself  with  my  pointless  martyrdom.  Maybe 
I  can  then  conclude,  about  myself,  “Someone  that  self-sacrificing,  that  willing  to 
help  someone — that  has  to  be  a  good  person.”  Not  so.  It  might  be  just  a  person 
trying  to  look  good  pretending  to  solve  what  appears  to  be  a  difficult  problem 
instead  of  actually  being  good  and  addressing  something  real. 

Maybe  instead  of  continuing  our  friendship  I  should  just  go  off  somewhere, 
get  my  act  together,  and  lead  by  example. 

And  none  of  this  is  a  justification  for  abandoning  those  in  real  need  to  pursue 
your  narrow,  blind  ambition,  in  case  it  has  to  be  said. 

A  Reciprocal  Arrangement 

Here’s  something  to  consider:  If  you  have  a  friend  whose  friendship  you 
wouldn’t  recommend  to  your  sister,  or  your  father,  or  your  son,  why  would  you 
have  such  a  friend  for  yourself?  You  might  say:  out  of  loyalty.  Well,  loyalty  is 
not  identical  to  stupidity.  Loyalty  must  be  negotiated,  fairly  and  honestly. 
Friendship  is  a  reciprocal  arrangement.  You  are  not  morally  obliged  to  support 
someone  who  is  making  the  world  a  worse  place.  Quite  the  opposite.  You  should 
choose  people  who  want  things  to  be  better,  not  worse.  It’s  a  good  thing,  not  a 
selfish  thing,  to  choose  people  who  are  good  for  you.  It’s  appropriate  and 
praiseworthy  to  associate  with  people  whose  lives  would  be  improved  if  they 
saw  your  life  improve. 

If  you  surround  yourself  with  people  who  support  your  upward  aim,  they  will 
not  tolerate  your  cynicism  and  destructiveness.  They  will  instead  encourage  you 
when  you  do  good  for  yourself  and  others  and  punish  you  carefully  when  you  do 


not.  This  will  help  bolster  your  resolve  to  do  what  you  should  do,  in  the  most 
appropriate  and  careful  manner.  People  who  are  not  aiming  up  will  do  the 
opposite.  They  will  offer  a  former  smoker  a  cigarette  and  a  former  alcoholic  a 
beer.  They  will  become  jealous  when  you  succeed,  or  do  something  pristine. 
They  will  withdraw  their  presence  or  support,  or  actively  punish  you  for  it.  They 
will  over-ride  your  accomplishment  with  a  past  action,  real  or  imaginary,  of  their 
own.  Maybe  they  are  trying  to  test  you,  to  see  if  your  resolve  is  real,  to  see  if  you 
are  genuine.  But  mostly  they  are  dragging  you  down  because  your  new 
improvements  cast  their  faults  in  an  even  dimmer  light. 

It  is  for  this  reason  that  every  good  example  is  a  fateful  challenge,  and  every 
hero,  a  judge.  Michelangelo’s  great  perfect  marble  David  cries  out  to  its 
observer:  “You  could  be  more  than  you  are.”  When  you  dare  aspire  upward,  you 
reveal  the  inadequacy  of  the  present  and  the  promise  of  the  future.  Then  you 
disturb  others,  in  the  depths  of  their  souls,  where  they  understand  that  their 
cynicism  and  immobility  are  unjustifiable.  You  play  Abel  to  their  Cain.  You 
remind  them  that  they  ceased  caring  not  because  of  life’s  horrors,  which  are 
undeniable,  but  because  they  do  not  want  to  lift  the  world  up  on  to  their 
shoulders,  where  it  belongs. 

Don’t  think  that  it  is  easier  to  surround  yourself  with  good  healthy  people  than 
with  bad  unhealthy  people.  It’s  not.  A  good,  healthy  person  is  an  ideal.  It 
requires  strength  and  daring  to  stand  up  near  such  a  person.  Have  some  humility. 
Have  some  courage.  Use  your  judgment,  and  protect  yourself  from  too-uncritical 
compassion  and  pity. 

Make  friends  with  people  who  want  the  best  for  you. 


RULE  4 


COMPARE  YOURSELF  TO  WHO  YOU  WERE  YESTERDAY, 
NOT  TO  WHO  SOMEONE  ELSE  IS  TODAY 

THE  INTERNAL  CRITIC 

It  was  easier  for  people  to  be  good  at  something  when  more  of  us  lived  in  small, 
rural  communities.  Someone  could  be  homecoming  queen.  Someone  else  could 
be  spelling-bee  champ,  math  whiz  or  basketball  star.  There  were  only  one  or  two 
mechanics  and  a  couple  of  teachers.  In  each  of  their  domains,  these  local  heroes 
had  the  opportunity  to  enjoy  the  serotonin-fuelled  confidence  of  the  victor.  It 
may  be  for  that  reason  that  people  who  were  born  in  small  towns  are  statistically 
overrepresented  among  the  eminent.  If  you’re  one  in  a  million  now,  but 
originated  in  modern  New  York,  there’s  twenty  of  you — and  most  of  us  now  live 
in  cities.  What’s  more,  we  have  become  digitally  connected  to  the  entire  seven 
billion.  Our  hierarchies  of  accomplishment  are  now  dizzyingly  vertical. 

No  matter  how  good  you  are  at  something,  or  how  you  rank  your 
accomplishments,  there  is  someone  out  there  who  makes  you  look  incompetent. 
You’re  a  decent  guitar  player,  but  you’re  not  Jimmy  Page  or  Jack  White.  You’re 
almost  certainly  not  even  going  to  rock  your  local  pub.  You’re  a  good  cook,  but 
there  are  many  great  chefs.  Your  mother’s  recipe  for  fish  heads  and  rice,  no 
matter  how  celebrated  in  her  village  of  origin,  doesn’t  cut  it  in  these  days  of 
grapefruit  foam  and  Scotch/tobacco  ice-cream.  Some  Mafia  don  has  a  tackier 
yacht.  Some  obsessive  CEO  has  a  more  complicated  self-winding  watch,  kept  in 
his  more  valuable  mechanical  hardwood-and-steel  automatic  self-winding  watch 
case.  Even  the  most  stunning  Hollywood  actress  eventually  transforms  into  the 
Evil  Queen,  on  eternal,  paranoid  watch  for  the  new  Snow  White.  And  you?  Your 
career  is  boring  and  pointless,  your  housekeeping  skills  are  second-rate,  your 
taste  is  appalling,  you’re  fatter  than  your  friends,  and  everyone  dreads  your 
parties.  Who  cares  if  you  are  prime  minister  of  Canada  when  someone  else  is  the 
president  of  the  United  States? 

Inside  us  dwells  a  critical  internal  voice  and  spirit  that  knows  all  this.  It’s 
predisposed  to  make  its  noisy  case.  It  condemns  our  mediocre  efforts.  It  can  be 
very  difficult  to  quell.  Worse,  critics  of  its  sort  are  necessary.  There  is  no 
shortage  of  tasteless  artists,  tuneless  musicians,  poisonous  cooks, 
bureaucratically-personality-disordered  middle  managers,  hack  novelists  and 
tedious,  ideology-ridden  professors.  Things  and  people  differ  importantly  in  their 


qualities.  Awful  music  torments  listeners  everywhere.  Poorly  designed  buildings 
crumble  in  earthquakes.  Substandard  automobiles  kill  their  drivers  when  they 
crash.  Failure  is  the  price  we  pay  for  standards  and,  because  mediocrity  has 
consequences  both  real  and  harsh,  standards  are  necessary. 

We  are  not  equal  in  ability  or  outcome,  and  never  will  be.  Avery  small 
number  of  people  produce  very  much  of  everything.  The  winners  don’t  take  all, 
but  they  take  most,  and  the  bottom  is  not  a  good  place  to  be.  People  are  unhappy 
at  the  bottom.  They  get  sick  there,  and  remain  unknown  and  unloved.  They 
waste  their  lives  there.  They  die  there.  In  consequence,  the  self-denigrating  voice 
in  the  minds  of  people  weaves  a  devastating  tale.  Life  is  a  zero-sum  game. 
Worthlessness  is  the  default  condition.  What  but  willful  blindness  could  possibly 
shelter  people  from  such  withering  criticism?  It  is  for  such  reasons  that  a  whole 
generation  of  social  psychologists  recommended  “positive  illusions”  as  the  only 
reliable  route  to  mental  health.  Their  credo?  Let  a  lie  be  your  umbrella.  A  more 
dismal,  wretched,  pessimistic  philosophy  can  hardly  be  imagined:  things  are  so 
terrible  that  only  delusion  can  save  you. 

Here  is  an  alternative  approach  (and  one  that  requires  no  illusions).  If  the 
cards  are  always  stacked  against  you,  perhaps  the  game  you  are  playing  is 
somehow  rigged  (perhaps  by  you,  unbeknownst  to  yourself).  If  the  internal  voice 
makes  you  doubt  the  value  of  your  endeavours — or  your  life,  or  life  itself — 
perhaps  you  should  stop  listening.  If  the  critical  voice  within  says  the  same 
denigrating  things  about  everyone,  no  matter  how  successful,  how  reliable  can  it 
be?  Maybe  its  comments  are  chatter,  not  wisdom.  There  will  always  be  people 
better  than  you — that’s  a  cliche  of  nihilism,  like  the  phrase,  In  a  million  years, 
who’s  going  to  know  the  difference?  The  proper  response  to  that  statement  is  not, 
Well,  then,  everything  is  meaningless.  It’s,  Any  idiot  can  choose  a  frame  of  time 
within  which  nothing  matters.  Talking  yourself  into  irrelevance  is  not  a  profound 
critique  of  Being.  It’s  a  cheap  trick  of  the  rational  mind. 

Many  Good  Games 

Standards  of  better  or  worse  are  not  illusory  or  unnecessary.  If  you  hadn’t 
decided  that  what  you  are  doing  right  now  was  better  than  the  alternatives,  you 
wouldn’t  be  doing  it.  The  idea  of  a  value-free  choice  is  a  contradiction  in  terms. 
Value  judgments  are  a  precondition  for  action.  Furthermore,  every  activity,  once 
chosen,  comes  with  its  own  internal  standards  of  accomplishment.  If  something 
can  be  done  at  all,  it  can  be  done  better  or  worse.  To  do  anything  at  all  is 
therefore  to  play  a  game  with  a  defined  and  valued  end,  which  can  always  be 
reached  more  or  less  efficiently  and  elegantly.  Every  game  comes  with  its  chance 


of  success  or  failure.  Differentials  in  quality  are  omnipresent.  Furthermore,  if 
there  was  no  better  and  worse,  nothing  would  be  worth  doing.  There  would  be 
no  value  and,  therefore,  no  meaning.  Why  make  an  effort  if  it  doesn’t  improve 
anything?  Meaning  itself  requires  the  difference  between  better  and  worse.  How, 
then,  can  the  voice  of  critical  self-consciousness  be  stilled?  Where  are  the  flaws 
in  the  apparently  impeccable  logic  of  its  message? 

We  might  start  by  considering  the  all-too-black-and-white  words  themselves: 
“success”  or  “failure.”  You  are  either  a  success,  a  comprehensive,  singular,  over¬ 
all  good  thing,  or  its  opposite,  a  failure,  a  comprehensive,  singular,  irredeemably 
bad  thing.  The  words  imply  no  alternative  and  no  middle  ground.  However,  in  a 
world  as  complex  as  ours,  such  generalizations  (really,  such  failure  to 
differentiate)  are  a  sign  of  naive,  unsophisticated  or  even  malevolent  analysis. 
There  are  vital  degrees  and  gradations  of  value  obliterated  by  this  binary  system, 
and  the  consequences  are  not  good. 

To  begin  with,  there  is  not  just  one  game  at  which  to  succeed  or  fail.  There  are 
many  games  and,  more  specifically,  many  good  games — games  that  match  your 
talents,  involve  you  productively  with  other  people,  and  sustain  and  even 
improve  themselves  across  time.  Lawyer  is  a  good  game.  So  is  plumber, 
physician,  carpenter,  or  schoolteacher.  The  world  allows  for  many  ways  of 
Being.  If  you  don’t  succeed  at  one,  you  can  try  another.  You  can  pick  something 
better  matched  to  your  unique  mix  of  strengths,  weaknesses  and  situation. 
Furthermore,  if  changing  games  does  not  work,  you  can  invent  a  new  one.  I 
recently  watched  a  talent  show  featuring  a  mime  who  taped  his  mouth  shut  and 
did  something  ridiculous  with  oven  mitts.  That  was  unexpected.  That  was 
original.  It  seemed  to  be  working  for  him. 

It’s  also  unlikely  that  you’re  playing  only  one  game.  You  have  a  career  and 
friends  and  family  members  and  personal  projects  and  artistic  endeavors  and 
athletic  pursuits.  You  might  consider  judging  your  success  across  all  the  games 
you  play.  Imagine  that  you  are  very  good  at  some,  middling  at  others,  and 
terrible  at  the  remainder.  Perhaps  that’s  how  it  should  be.  You  might  object:  I 
should  be  winning  at  everything!  But  winning  at  everything  might  only  mean 
that  you’re  not  doing  anything  new  or  difficult.  You  might  be  winning  but  you’re 
not  growing,  and  growing  might  be  the  most  important  form  of  winning.  Should 
victory  in  the  present  always  take  precedence  over  trajectory  across  time? 

Finally,  you  might  come  to  realize  that  the  specifics  of  the  many  games  you 
are  playing  are  so  unique  to  you,  so  individual,  that  comparison  to  others  is 
simply  inappropriate.  Perhaps  you  are  overvaluing  what  you  don’t  have  and 
undervaluing  what  you  do.  There’s  some  real  utility  in  gratitude.  It’s  also  good 
protection  against  the  dangers  of  victimhood  and  resentment.  Your  colleague 


outperforms  you  at  work.  His  wife,  however,  is  having  an  affair,  while  your 
marriage  is  stable  and  happy.  Who  has  it  better?  The  celebrity  you  admire  is  a 
chronic  drunk  driver  and  bigot.  Is  his  life  truly  preferable  to  yours? 

When  the  internal  critic  puts  you  down  using  such  comparisons,  here’s  how  it 
operates:  First,  it  selects  a  single,  arbitrary  domain  of  comparison  (fame,  maybe, 
or  power).  Then  it  acts  as  if  that  domain  is  the  only  one  that  is  relevant.  Then  it 
contrasts  you  unfavourably  with  someone  truly  stellar,  within  that  domain.  It  can 
take  that  final  step  even  further,  using  the  unbridgeable  gap  between  you  and  its 
target  of  comparison  as  evidence  for  the  fundamental  injustice  of  life.  That  way 
your  motivation  to  do  anything  at  all  can  be  most  effectively  undermined.  Those 
who  accept  such  an  approach  to  self-evaluation  certainly  can’t  be  accused  of 
making  things  too  easy  for  themselves.  But  it’s  just  as  big  a  problem  to  make 
things  too  difficult. 

When  we  are  very  young  we  are  neither  individual  nor  informed.  We  have  not 
had  the  time  nor  gained  the  wisdom  to  develop  our  own  standards.  In 
consequence,  we  must  compare  ourselves  to  others,  because  standards  are 
necessary.  Without  them,  there  is  nowhere  to  go  and  nothing  to  do.  As  we 
mature  we  become,  by  contrast,  increasingly  individual  and  unique.  The 
conditions  of  our  lives  become  more  and  more  personal  and  less  and  less 
comparable  with  those  of  others.  Symbolically  speaking,  this  means  we  must 
leave  the  house  ruled  by  our  father,  and  confront  the  chaos  of  our  individual 
Being.  We  must  take  note  of  our  disarray,  without  completely  abandoning  that 
father  in  the  process.  We  must  then  rediscover  the  values  of  our  culture — veiled 
from  us  by  our  ignorance,  hidden  in  the  dusty  treasure-trove  of  the  past — rescue 
them,  and  integrate  them  into  our  own  lives.  This  is  what  gives  existence  its  full 
and  necessary  meaning. 

Who  are  you?  You  think  you  know,  but  maybe  you  don’t.  You  are,  for 
example,  neither  your  own  master,  nor  your  own  slave.  You  cannot  easily  tell 
yourself  what  to  do  and  compel  your  own  obedience  (any  more  than  you  can 
easily  tell  your  husband,  wife,  son  or  daughter  what  to  do,  and  compel  theirs). 
You  are  interested  in  some  things  and  not  in  others.  You  can  shape  that  interest, 
but  there  are  limits.  Some  activities  will  always  engage  you,  and  others  simply 
will  not. 

You  have  a  nature.  You  can  play  the  tyrant  to  it,  but  you  will  certainly  rebel. 
How  hard  can  you  force  yourself  to  work  and  sustain  your  desire  to  work?  How 
much  can  you  sacrifice  to  your  partner  before  generosity  turns  to  resentment? 
What  is  it  that  you  actually  love?  What  is  it  that  you  genuinely  want?  Before  you 
can  articulate  your  own  standards  of  value,  you  must  see  yourself  as  a  stranger — 
and  then  you  must  get  to  know  yourself.  What  do  you  find  valuable  or 


pleasurable?  How  much  leisure,  enjoyment,  and  reward  do  you  require,  so  that 
you  feel  like  more  than  a  beast  of  burden?  How  must  you  treat  yourself,  so  you 
won’t  kick  over  the  traces  and  smash  up  your  corral?  You  could  force  yourself 
through  your  daily  grind  and  kick  your  dog  in  frustration  when  you  come  home. 
You  could  watch  the  precious  days  tick  by.  Or  you  could  learn  how  to  entice 
yourself  into  sustainable,  productive  activity.  Do  you  ask  yourself  what  you 
want?  Do  you  negotiate  fairly  with  yourself?  Or  are  you  a  tyrant,  with  yourself 
as  slave? 

When  do  you  dislike  your  parents,  your  spouse,  or  your  children,  and  why? 
What  might  be  done  about  that?  What  do  you  need  and  want  from  your  friends 
and  your  business  partners?  This  is  not  a  mere  matter  of  what  you  should  want. 
I’m  not  talking  about  what  other  people  require  from  you,  or  your  duties  to  them. 
I’m  talking  about  determining  the  nature  of  your  moral  obligation,  to  yourself. 
Should  might  enter  into  it,  because  you  are  nested  within  a  network  of  social 
obligations.  Should  is  your  responsibility,  and  you  should  live  up  to  it.  But  this 
does  not  mean  you  must  take  the  role  of  lap-dog,  obedient  and  harmless.  That’s 
how  a  dictator  wants  his  slaves. 

Dare,  instead,  to  be  dangerous.  Dare  to  be  truthful.  Dare  to  articulate  yourself, 
and  express  (or  at  least  become  aware  of)  what  would  really  justify  your  life.  If 
you  allowed  your  dark  and  unspoken  desires  for  your  partner,  for  example,  to 
manifest  themselves — if  you  were  even  willing  to  consider  them — you  might 
discover  that  they  were  not  so  dark,  given  the  light  of  day.  You  might  discover, 
instead,  that  you  were  just  afraid  and,  so,  pretending  to  be  moral.  You  might  find 
that  getting  what  you  actually  desire  would  stop  you  from  being  tempted  and 
straying.  Are  you  so  sure  that  your  partner  would  be  unhappy  if  more  of  you  rose 
to  the  surface?  The  femme  fatale  and  the  anti-hero  are  sexually  attractive  for  a 
reason.... 

How  do  you  need  to  be  spoken  to?  What  do  you  need  to  take  from  people? 
What  are  you  putting  up  with,  or  pretending  to  like,  from  duty  or  obligation? 
Consult  your  resentment.  It’s  a  revelatory  emotion,  for  all  its  pathology.  It’s  part 
of  an  evil  triad:  arrogance,  deceit,  and  resentment.  Nothing  causes  more  harm 
than  this  underworld  Trinity.  But  resentment  always  means  one  of  two  things. 
Either  the  resentful  person  is  immature,  in  which  case  he  or  she  should  shut  up, 
quit  whining,  and  get  on  with  it,  or  there  is  tyranny  afoot — in  which  case  the 
person  subjugated  has  a  moral  obligation  to  speak  up.  Why?  Because  the 
consequence  of  remaining  silent  is  worse.  Of  course,  it’s  easier  in  the  moment  to 
stay  silent  and  avoid  conflict.  But  in  the  long  term,  that’s  deadly.  When  you  have 
something  to  say,  silence  is  a  lie — and  tyranny  feeds  on  lies.  When  should  you 
push  back  against  oppression,  despite  the  danger?  When  you  start  nursing  secret 


fantasies  of  revenge;  when  your  life  is  being  poisoned  and  your  imagination  fills 
with  the  wish  to  devour  and  destroy. 

I  had  a  client  decades  ago  who  suffered  from  severe  obsessive-compulsive 
disorder.  He  had  to  line  up  his  pyjamas  just  right  before  he  could  go  to  sleep  at 
night.  Then  he  had  to  fluff  his  pillow.  Then  he  had  to  adjust  the  bedsheets.  Over 
and  over  and  over  and  over.  I  said,  “Maybe  that  part  of  you,  that  insanely 
persistent  part,  wants  something,  inarticulate  though  it  may  be.  Let  it  have  its 
say.  What  could  it  be?”  He  said,  “Control.”  I  said,  “Close  your  eyes  and  let  it  tell 
you  what  it  wants.  Don’t  let  fear  stop  you.  You  don’t  have  to  act  it  out,  just 
because  you’re  thinking  it.”  He  said,  “It  wants  me  to  take  my  stepfather  by  the 
collar,  put  him  up  against  the  door,  and  shake  him  like  a  rat.”  Maybe  it  was  time 
to  shake  someone  like  a  rat,  although  I  suggested  something  a  bit  less  primal. 

But  God  only  knows  what  battles  must  be  fought,  forthrightly,  voluntarily,  on  the 
road  to  peace.  What  do  you  do  to  avoid  conflict,  necessary  though  it  may  be? 
What  are  you  inclined  to  lie  about,  assuming  that  the  truth  might  be  intolerable? 
What  do  you  fake? 

The  infant  is  dependent  on  his  parents  for  almost  everything  he  needs.  The 
child — the  successful  child — can  leave  his  parents,  at  least  temporarily,  and 
make  friends.  He  gives  up  a  little  of  himself  to  do  that,  but  gains  much  in  return. 
The  successful  adolescent  must  take  that  process  to  its  logical  conclusion.  He 
has  to  leave  his  parents  and  become  like  everyone  else.  He  has  to  integrate  with 
the  group  so  he  can  transcend  his  childhood  dependency.  Once  integrated,  the 
successful  adult  then  must  learn  how  to  be  just  the  right  amount  different  from 
everyone  else. 

Be  cautious  when  you’re  comparing  yourself  to  others.  You’re  a  singular 
being,  once  you’re  an  adult.  You  have  your  own  particular,  specific  problems — 
financial,  intimate,  psychological,  and  otherwise.  Those  are  embedded  in  the 
unique  broader  context  of  your  existence.  Your  career  or  job  works  for  you  in  a 
personal  manner,  or  it  does  not,  and  it  does  so  in  a  unique  interplay  with  the 
other  specifics  of  your  life.  You  must  decide  how  much  of  your  time  to  spend  on 
this,  and  how  much  on  that.  You  must  decide  what  to  let  go,  and  what  to  pursue. 

The  Point  of  Our  Eyes  (or,  Take  Stock) 

Our  eyes  are  always  pointing  at  things  we  are  interested  in  approaching,  or 
investigating,  or  looking  for,  or  having.  We  must  see,  but  to  see,  we  must  aim,  so 
we  are  always  aiming.  Our  minds  are  built  on  the  hunting-and-gathering 
platforms  of  our  bodies.  To  hunt  is  to  specify  a  target,  track  it,  and  throw  at  it.  To 
gather  is  to  specify  and  to  grasp.  We  fling  stones,  and  spears,  and  boomerangs. 


We  toss  balls  through  hoops,  and  hit  pucks  into  nets,  and  curl  carved  granite 
rocks  down  the  ice  onto  horizontal  bull’s-eyes.  We  launch  projectiles  at  targets 
with  bows,  guns,  rifles  and  rockets.  We  hurl  insults,  launch  plans,  and  pitch 
ideas.  We  succeed  when  we  score  a  goal  or  hit  a  target.  We  fail,  or  sin,  when  we 
do  not  (as  the  word  sin  means  to  miss  the  mark  ).  We  cannot  navigate,  without 
something  to  aim  at  and,  while  we  are  in  this  world,  we  must  always  navigate. 

We  are  always  and  simultaneously  at  point  “a”  (which  is  less  desirable  than  it 
could  be),  moving  towards  point  “b”  (which  we  deem  better,  in  accordance  with 
our  explicit  and  implicit  values).  We  always  encounter  the  world  in  a  state  of 
insufficiency  and  seek  its  correction.  We  can  imagine  new  ways  that  things  could 
be  set  right,  and  improved,  even  if  we  have  everything  we  thought  we  needed. 
Even  when  satisfied,  temporarily,  we  remain  curious.  We  live  within  a 
framework  that  defines  the  present  as  eternally  lacking  and  the  future  as 
eternally  better.  If  we  did  not  see  things  this  way,  we  would  not  act  at  all.  We 
wouldn’t  even  be  able  to  see,  because  to  see  we  must  focus,  and  to  focus  we 
must  pick  one  thing  above  all  else  on  which  to  focus. 

But  we  can  see.  We  can  even  see  things  that  aren’t  there.  We  can  envision  new 
ways  that  things  could  be  better.  We  can  construct  new,  hypothetical  worlds, 
where  problems  we  weren’t  even  aware  of  can  now  show  themselves  and  be 
addressed.  The  advantages  of  this  are  obvious:  we  can  change  the  world  so  that 
the  intolerable  state  of  the  present  can  be  rectified  in  the  future.  The 
disadvantage  to  all  this  foresight  and  creativity  is  chronic  unease  and  discomfort. 
Because  we  always  contrast  what  is  with  what  could  be,  we  have  to  aim  at  what 
could  be.  But  we  can  aim  too  high.  Or  too  low.  Or  too  chaotically.  So  we  fail  and 
live  in  disappointment,  even  when  we  appear  to  others  to  be  living  well.  How 
can  we  benefit  from  our  imaginativeness,  our  ability  to  improve  the  future, 
without  continually  denigrating  our  current,  insufficiently  successful  and 
worthless  lives? 

The  first  step,  perhaps,  is  to  take  stock.  Who  are  you?  When  you  buy  a  house 
and  prepare  to  live  in  it,  you  hire  an  inspector  to  list  all  its  faults — as  it  is,  in 
reality,  now,  not  as  you  wish  it  could  be.  You’ll  even  pay  him  for  the  bad  news. 
You  need  to  know.  You  need  to  discover  the  home’s  hidden  flaws.  You  need  to 
know  whether  they  are  cosmetic  imperfections  or  structural  inadequacies.  You 
need  to  know  because  you  can’t  fix  something  if  you  don’t  know  it’s  broken — 
and  you’re  broken.  You  need  an  inspector.  The  internal  critic — it  could  play  that 
role,  if  you  could  get  it  on  track;  if  you  and  it  could  cooperate.  It  could  help  you 
take  stock.  But  you  must  walk  through  your  psychological  house  with  it  and 
listen  judiciously  to  what  it  says.  Maybe  you’re  a  handy-man’s  dream,  a  real 


fixer-upper.  How  can  you  start  your  renovations  without  being  demoralized, 
even  crushed,  by  your  internal  critic’s  lengthy  and  painful  report  of  your 
inadequacies? 

Here’s  a  hint.  The  future  is  like  the  past.  But  there’s  a  crucial  difference.  The 
past  is  fixed,  but  the  future — it  could  be  better.  It  could  be  better,  some  precise 
amount — the  amount  that  can  be  achieved,  perhaps,  in  a  day,  with  some  minimal 
engagement.  The  present  is  eternally  flawed.  But  where  you  start  might  not  be  as 
important  as  the  direction  you  are  heading.  Perhaps  happiness  is  always  to  be 
found  in  the  journey  uphill,  and  not  in  the  fleeting  sense  of  satisfaction  awaiting 
at  the  next  peak.  Much  of  happiness  is  hope,  no  matter  how  deep  the  underworld 
in  which  that  hope  was  conceived. 

Called  upon  properly,  the  internal  critic  will  suggest  something  to  set  in  order, 
which  you  could  set  in  order,  which  you  would  set  in  order — voluntarily,  without 
resentment,  even  with  pleasure.  Ask  yourself:  is  there  one  thing  that  exists  in 
disarray  in  your  life  or  your  situation  that  you  could,  and  would,  set  straight? 
Could  you,  and  would  you,  fix  that  one  thing  that  announces  itself  humbly  in 
need  of  repair?  Could  you  do  it  now?  Imagine  that  you  are  someone  with  whom 
you  must  negotiate.  Imagine  further  that  you  are  lazy,  touchy,  resentful  and  hard 
to  get  along  with.  With  that  attitude,  it’s  not  going  to  be  easy  to  get  you  moving. 
You  might  have  to  use  a  little  charm  and  playfulness.  “Excuse  me,”  you  might 
say  to  yourself,  without  irony  or  sarcasm.  “I’m  trying  to  reduce  some  of  the 
unnecessary  suffering  around  here.  I  could  use  some  help.”  Keep  the  derision  at 
bay.  “I’m  wondering  if  there  is  anything  that  you  would  be  willing  to  do?  I’d  be 
very  grateful  for  your  service.”  Ask  honestly  and  with  humility.  That’s  no  simple 
matter. 

You  might  have  to  negotiate  further,  depending  on  your  state  of  mind.  Maybe 
you  don’t  trust  yourself.  You  think  that  you’ll  ask  yourself  for  one  thing  and, 
having  delivered,  immediately  demand  more.  And  you’ll  be  punitive  and  hurtful 
about  it.  And  you’ll  denigrate  what  was  already  offered.  Who  wants  to  work  for 
a  tyrant  like  that?  Not  you.  That’s  why  you  don’t  do  what  you  want  yourself  to 
do.  You’re  a  bad  employee — but  a  worse  boss.  Maybe  you  need  to  say  to 
yourself,  “OK.  I  know  we  haven’t  gotten  along  very  well  in  the  past.  I’m  sorry 
about  that.  I’m  trying  to  improve.  I’ll  probably  make  some  more  mistakes  along 
the  way,  but  I’ll  try  to  listen  if  you  object.  I’ll  try  to  learn.  I  noticed,  just  now, 
today,  that  you  weren’t  really  jumping  at  the  opportunity  to  help  when  I  asked.  Is 
there  something  I  could  offer  in  return  for  your  cooperation?  Maybe  if  you  did 
the  dishes,  we  could  go  for  coffee.  You  like  espresso.  How  about  an  espresso — 
maybe  a  double  shot?  Or  is  there  something  else  you  want?”  Then  you  could 
listen.  Maybe  you’ll  hear  a  voice  inside  (maybe  it’s  even  the  voice  of  a  long-lost 


child).  Maybe  it  will  reply,  “Really?  You  really  want  to  do  something  nice  for 
me?  You’ll  really  do  it?  It’s  not  a  trick?” 

This  is  where  you  must  be  careful. 

That  little  voice — that’s  the  voice  of  someone  once  burnt  and  twice  shy.  So, 
you  could  say,  very  carefully,  “Really.  I  might  not  do  it  very  well,  and  I  might 
not  be  great  company,  but  I  will  do  something  nice  for  you.  I  promise.”  A  little 
careful  kindness  goes  a  long  way,  and  judicious  reward  is  a  powerful  motivator. 
Then  you  could  take  that  small  bit  of  yourself  by  the  hand  and  do  the  damn 
dishes.  And  then  you  better  not  go  clean  the  bathroom  and  forget  about  the 
coffee  or  the  movie  or  the  beer  or  it  will  be  even  harder  to  call  those  forgotten 
parts  of  yourself  forth  from  the  nooks  and  crannies  of  the  underworld. 

You  might  ask  yourself,  “What  could  I  say  to  someone  else — my  friend,  my 
brother,  my  boss,  my  assistant — that  would  set  things  a  bit  more  right  between 
us  tomorrow?  What  bit  of  chaos  might  I  eradicate  at  home,  on  my  desk,  in  my 
kitchen,  tonight,  so  that  the  stage  could  be  set  for  a  better  play?  What  snakes 
might  I  banish  from  my  closet — and  my  mind?”  Five  hundred  small  decisions, 
five  hundred  tiny  actions,  compose  your  day,  today,  and  every  day.  Could  you 
aim  one  or  two  of  these  at  a  better  result?  Better,  in  your  own  private  opinion,  by 
your  own  individual  standards?  Could  you  compare  your  specific  personal 
tomorrow  with  your  specific  personal  yesterday?  Could  you  use  your  own 
judgment,  and  ask  yourself  what  that  better  tomorrow  might  be? 

Aim  small.  You  don’t  want  to  shoulder  too  much  to  begin  with,  given  your 
limited  talents,  tendency  to  deceive,  burden  of  resentment,  and  ability  to  shirk 
responsibility.  Thus,  you  set  the  following  goal:  by  the  end  of  the  day,  I  want 
things  in  my  life  to  be  a  tiny  bit  better  than  they  were  this  morning.  Then  you  ask 
yourself,  “What  could  I  do,  that  I  would  do,  that  would  accomplish  that,  and 
what  small  thing  would  I  like  as  a  reward?”  Then  you  do  what  you  have  decided 
to  do,  even  if  you  do  it  badly.  Then  you  give  yourself  that  damn  coffee,  in 
triumph.  Maybe  you  feel  a  bit  stupid  about  it,  but  you  do  it  anyway.  And  you  do 
the  same  thing  tomorrow,  and  the  next  day,  and  the  next.  And,  with  each  day, 
your  baseline  of  comparison  gets  a  little  higher,  and  that’s  magic.  That’s 
compound  interest.  Do  that  for  three  years,  and  your  life  will  be  entirely 
different.  Now  you’re  aiming  for  something  higher.  Now  you’re  wishing  on  a 
star.  Now  the  beam  is  disappearing  from  your  eye,  and  you’re  learning  to  see. 
And  what  you  aim  at  determines  what  you  see.  That’s  worth  repeating.  What  you 
aim  at  determines  what  you  see. 


What  You  Want  and  What  You  See 


The  dependency  of  sight  on  aim  (and,  therefore,  on  value — because  you  aim  at 
what  you  value)  was  demonstrated  unforgettably  by  the  cognitive  psychologist 
Daniel  Simons  more  than  fifteen  years  ago.  Simons  was  investigating 
something  called  “sustained  inattentional  blindness.”  He  would  sit  his  research 
subjects  in  front  of  a  video  monitor  and  show  them,  for  example,  a  field  of 
wheat.  Then  he  would  transform  the  photo  slowly,  secretly,  while  they  watched. 
He  would  slowly  fade  in  a  road  cutting  through  the  wheat.  He  didn’t  insert  some 
little  easy-to-miss  footpath,  either.  It  was  a  major  trail,  occupying  a  good  third  of 
the  image.  Remarkably,  the  observers  would  frequently  fail  to  take  notice. 

The  demonstration  that  made  Dr.  Simons  famous  was  of  the  same  kind,  but 
more  dramatic — even  unbelievable.  First,  he  produced  a  video  of  two  teams  of 
three  people.  One  team  was  wearing  white  shirts,  the  other,  black.  (The  two 
teams  were  not  off  in  the  distance,  either,  or  in  any  way  difficult  to  see.  The  six 
of  them  filled  much  of  the  video  screen,  and  their  facial  features  were  close 
enough  to  see  clearly.)  Each  team  had  its  own  ball,  which  they  bounced  or  threw 
to  their  other  team  members,  as  they  moved  and  feinted  in  the  small  space  in 
front  of  the  elevators  where  the  game  was  filmed.  Once  Dan  had  his  video,  he 
showed  it  to  his  study  participants.  He  asked  each  of  them  to  count  the  number 
of  times  the  white  shirts  threw  the  ball  back  and  forth  to  one  another.  After  a  few 
minutes,  his  subjects  were  asked  to  report  the  number  of  passes.  Most  answered 
“15.”  That  was  the  correct  answer.  Most  felt  pretty  good  about  that.  Ha!  They 
passed  the  test!  But  then  Dr.  Simons  asked,  “Did  you  see  the  gorilla?” 

Was  this  a  joke?  What  gorilla? 

So,  he  said,  “Watch  the  video  again.  But  this  time,  don’t  count.”  Sure  enough, 
a  minute  or  so  in,  a  man  dressed  in  a  gorilla  suit  waltzes  right  into  the  middle  of 
the  game  for  a  few  long  seconds,  stops,  and  then  beats  his  chest  in  the  manner  of 
stereotyped  gorillas  everywhere.  Right  in  the  middle  of  the  screen.  Large  as  life. 
Painfully  and  irrefutably  evident.  But  one  out  of  every  two  of  his  research 
subjects  missed  it,  the  first  time  they  saw  the  video.  It  gets  worse.  Dr.  Simons 
did  another  study.  This  time,  he  showed  his  subjects  a  video  of  someone  being 
served  at  a  counter.  The  server  dips  behind  the  counter  to  retrieve  something, 
and  pops  back  up.  So  what?  Most  of  his  participants  don’t  detect  anything  amiss. 
But  it  was  a  different  person  who  stood  up  in  the  original  server’s  place!  “No 
way,”  you  think.  “I’d  notice.”  But  it’s  “yes  way.”  There’s  a  high  probability  you 
wouldn’t  detect  the  change,  even  if  the  gender  or  race  of  the  person  is  switched 
at  the  same  time.  You’re  blind  too. 

This  is  partly  because  vision  is  expensive — psychophysiologically  expensive; 
neurologically  expensive.  Very  little  of  your  retina  is  high-resolution  fovea — the 


very  central,  high-resolution  part  of  the  eye,  used  to  do  such  things  as  identify 
faces.  Each  of  the  scarce  foveal  cells  needs  10,000  cells  in  the  visual  cortex 
merely  to  manage  the  first  part  of  the  multi-stage  processing  of  seeing.  Then 
each  of  those  10,000  requires  10,000  more  just  to  get  to  stage  two.  If  all  your 
retina  was  fovea  you  would  require  the  skull  of  a  B-movie  alien  to  house  your 
brain.  In  consequence,  we  triage,  when  we  see.  Most  of  our  vision  is  peripheral, 
and  low  resolution.  We  save  the  fovea  for  things  of  importance.  We  point  our 
high-resolution  capacities  at  the  few  specific  things  we  are  aiming  at.  And  we  let 
everything  else — which  is  almost  everything — fade,  unnoticed,  into  the 
background. 

If  something  you’re  not  attending  to  pops  its  ugly  head  up  in  a  manner  that 
directly  interferes  with  your  narrowly  focused  current  activity,  you  will  see  it. 
Otherwise,  it’s  just  not  there.  The  ball  on  which  Simons’s  research  subjects  were 
focused  was  never  obscured  by  the  gorilla  or  by  any  of  the  six  players.  Because 
of  that — because  the  gorilla  did  not  interfere  with  the  ongoing,  narrowly  defined 
task — it  was  indistinguishable  from  everything  else  the  participants  didn’t  see, 
when  they  were  looking  at  that  ball.  The  big  ape  could  be  safely  ignored.  That’s 
how  you  deal  with  the  overwhelming  complexity  of  the  world:  you  ignore  it, 
while  you  concentrate  minutely  on  your  private  concerns.  You  see  things  that 
facilitate  your  movement  forward,  toward  your  desired  goals.  You  detect 
obstacles,  when  they  pop  up  in  your  path.  You’re  blind  to  everything  else  (and 
there’s  a  lot  of  everything  else — so  you’re  very  blind).  And  it  has  to  be  that  way, 
because  there  is  much  more  of  the  world  than  there  is  of  you.  You  must  shepherd 
your  limited  resources  carefully.  Seeing  is  very  difficult,  so  you  must  choose 
what  to  see,  and  let  the  rest  go. 

There’s  a  profound  idea  in  the  ancient  Vedic  texts  (the  oldest  scriptures  of 
Hinduism,  and  part  of  the  bedrock  of  Indian  culture):  the  world,  as  perceived,  is 
maya — appearance  or  illusion.  This  means,  in  part,  that  people  are  blinded  by 
their  desires  (as  well  as  merely  incapable  of  seeing  things  as  they  truly  are).  This 
is  true,  in  a  sense  that  transcends  the  metaphorical.  Your  eyes  are  tools.  They  are 
there  to  help  you  get  what  you  want.  The  price  you  pay  for  that  utility,  that 
specific,  focused  direction,  is  blindness  to  everything  else.  This  doesn’t  matter  so 
much  when  things  are  going  well,  and  we  are  getting  what  we  want  (although  it 
can  be  a  problem,  even  then,  because  getting  what  we  currently  want  can  make 
blind  us  to  higher  callings).  But  all  that  ignored  world  presents  a  truly  terrible 
problem  when  we’re  in  crisis,  and  nothing  whatsoever  is  turning  out  the  way  we 
want  it  to.  Then,  there  can  be  far  too  much  to  deal  with.  Happily,  however,  that 
problem  contains  within  it  the  seeds  of  its  own  solution.  Since  you’ve  ignored  so 
much,  there  is  plenty  of  possibility  left  where  you  have  not  yet  looked. 


Imagine  that  you’re  unhappy.  You’re  not  getting  what  you  need.  Perversely, 
this  may  be  because  of  what  you  want.  You  are  blind,  because  of  what  you 
desire.  Perhaps  what  you  really  need  is  right  in  front  of  your  eyes,  but  you 
cannot  see  it  because  of  what  you  are  currently  aiming  for.  And  that  brings  us  to 
something  else:  the  price  that  must  be  paid  before  you,  or  anyone,  can  get  what 
they  want  (or,  better  yet,  what  they  need).  Think  about  it  this  way.  You  look  at 
the  world  in  your  particular,  idiosyncratic  manner.  You  use  a  set  of  tools  to 
screen  most  things  out  and  let  some  things  in.  You  have  spent  a  lot  of  time 
building  those  tools.  They’ve  become  habitual.  They’re  not  mere  abstract 
thoughts.  They’re  built  right  into  you.  They  orient  you  in  the  world.  They’re 
your  deepest  and  often  implicit  and  unconscious  values.  They’ve  become  part  of 
your  biological  structure.  They’re  alive.  And  they  don’t  want  to  disappear,  or 
transform,  or  die.  But  sometimes  their  time  has  come,  and  new  things  need  to  be 
born.  For  this  reason  (although  not  only  for  this  reason)  it  is  necessary  to  let 
things  go  during  the  journey  uphill.  If  things  are  not  going  well  for  you — well, 
that  might  be  because,  as  the  most  cynical  of  aphorisms  has  it,  life  sucks,  and 
then  you  die.  Before  your  crisis  impels  you  to  that  hideous  conclusion,  however, 
you  might  consider  the  following:  life  doesn ’t  have  the  problem.  You  do.  At  least 
that  realization  leaves  you  with  some  options.  If  your  life  is  not  going  well, 
perhaps  it  is  your  current  knowledge  that  is  insufficient,  not  life  itself.  Perhaps 
your  value  structure  needs  some  serious  retooling.  Perhaps  what  you  want  is 
blinding  you  to  what  else  could  be.  Perhaps  you  are  holding  on  to  your  desires, 
in  the  present,  so  tightly  that  you  cannot  see  anything  else — even  what  you  truly 
need. 

Imagine  that  you  are  thinking,  enviously,  “I  should  have  my  boss’s  job.”  If 
your  boss  sticks  to  his  post,  stubbornly  and  competently,  thoughts  like  that  will 
lead  you  into  in  a  state  of  irritation,  unhappiness  and  disgust.  You  might  realize 
this.  You  think,  “I  am  unhappy.  However,  I  could  be  cured  of  this  unhappiness  if 
I  could  just  fulfill  my  ambition.”  But  then  you  might  think  further.  “Wait,”  you 
think.  “Maybe  I’m  not  unhappy  because  I  don’t  have  my  boss’s  job.  Maybe  I’m 
unhappy  because  I  can’t  stop  wanting  that  job.”  That  doesn’t  mean  you  can  just 
simply  and  magically  tell  yourself  to  stop  wanting  that  job,  and  then  listen  and 
transform.  You  won’t — can’t,  in  fact — just  change  yourself  that  easily.  You  have 
to  dig  deeper.  You  must  change  what  you  are  after  more  profoundly. 

So,  you  might  think,  “I  don’t  know  what  to  do  about  this  stupid  suffering.  I 
can’t  just  abandon  my  ambitions.  That  would  leave  me  nowhere  to  go.  But  my 
longing  for  a  job  that  I  can’t  have  isn’t  working.”  You  might  decide  to  take  a 
different  tack.  You  might  ask,  instead,  for  the  revelation  of  a  different  plan:  one 
that  would  fulfill  your  desires  and  gratify  your  ambitions  in  a  real  sense,  but  that 


would  remove  from  your  life  the  bitterness  and  resentment  with  which  you  are 
currently  affected.  You  might  think,  “I  will  make  a  different  plan.  I  will  try  to 
want  whatever  it  is  that  would  make  my  life  better — whatever  that  might  be — 
and  I  will  start  working  on  it  now.  If  that  turns  out  to  mean  something  other  than 
chasing  my  boss’s  job,  I  will  accept  that  and  I  will  move  forward.” 

Now  you’re  on  a  whole  different  kind  of  trajectory.  Before,  what  was  right, 
desirable,  and  worthy  of  pursuit  was  something  narrow  and  concrete.  But  you 
became  stuck  there,  tightly  jammed  and  unhappy.  So  you  let  go.  You  make  the 
necessary  sacrifice,  and  allow  a  whole  new  world  of  possibility,  hidden  from  you 
because  of  your  previous  ambition,  to  reveal  itself.  And  there’s  a  lot  there.  What 
would  your  life  look  like,  if  it  were  better ?  What  would  Life  Itself  look  like? 
What  does  “better”  even  mean?  You  don’t  know.  And  it  doesn’t  matter  that  you 
don’t  know,  exactly,  right  away,  because  you  will  start  to  slowly  see  what  is 
“better,”  once  you  have  truly  decided  to  want  it.  You  will  start  to  perceive  what 
remained  hidden  from  you  by  your  presuppositions  and  preconceptions — by  the 
previous  mechanisms  of  your  vision.  You  will  begin  to  learn. 

This  will  only  work,  however,  if  you  genuinely  want  your  life  to  improve.  You 
can’t  fool  your  implicit  perceptual  structures.  Not  even  a  bit.  They  aim  where 
you  point  them.  To  retool,  to  take  stock,  to  aim  somewhere  better,  you  have  to 
think  it  through,  bottom  to  top.  You  have  to  scour  your  psyche.  You  have  to 
clean  the  damned  thing  up.  And  you  must  be  cautious,  because  making  your  life 
better  means  adopting  a  lot  of  responsibility,  and  that  takes  more  effort  and  care 
than  living  stupidly  in  pain  and  remaining  arrogant,  deceitful  and  resentful. 

What  if  it  was  the  case  that  the  world  revealed  whatever  goodness  it  contains 
in  precise  proportion  to  your  desire  for  the  best?  What  if  the  more  your 
conception  of  the  best  has  been  elevated,  expanded  and  rendered  sophisticated 
the  more  possibility  and  benefit  you  could  perceive?  This  doesn’t  mean  that  you 
can  have  what  you  want  merely  by  wishing  it,  or  that  everything  is 
interpretation,  or  that  there  is  no  reality.  The  world  is  still  there,  with  its 
structures  and  limits.  As  you  move  along  with  it,  it  cooperates  or  objects.  But 
you  can  dance  with  it,  if  your  aim  is  to  dance — and  maybe  you  can  even  lead,  if 
you  have  enough  skill  and  enough  grace.  This  is  not  theology.  It’s  not  mysticism. 
It’s  empirical  knowledge.  There  is  nothing  magical  here — or  nothing  more  than 
the  already-present  magic  of  consciousness.  We  only  see  what  we  aim  at.  The 
rest  of  the  world  (and  that’s  most  of  it)  is  hidden.  If  we  start  aiming  at  something 
different — something  like  “I  want  my  life  to  be  better” — our  minds  will  start 
presenting  us  with  new  information,  derived  from  the  previously  hidden  world, 
to  aid  us  in  that  pursuit.  Then  we  can  put  that  information  to  use  and  move,  and 
act,  and  observe,  and  improve.  And,  after  doing  so,  after  improving,  we  might 


pursue  something  different,  or  higher — something  like,  “I  want  whatever  might 
be  better  than  just  my  life  being  better.”  And  then  we  enter  a  more  elevated  and 
more  complete  reality. 

In  that  place,  what  might  we  focus  on?  What  might  we  see? 

Think  about  it  like  this.  Start  from  the  observation  that  we  indeed  desire  things 
— even  that  we  need  them.  That’s  human  nature.  We  share  the  experience  of 
hunger,  loneliness,  thirst,  sexual  desire,  aggression,  fear  and  pain.  Such  things 
are  elements  of  Being — primordial,  axiomatic  elements  of  Being.  But  we  must 
sort  and  organize  these  primordial  desires,  because  the  world  is  a  complex  and 
obstinately  real  place.  We  can’t  just  get  the  one  particular  thing  we  especially 
just  want  now,  along  with  everything  else  we  usually  want,  because  our  desires 
can  produce  conflict  with  our  other  desires,  as  well  as  with  other  people,  and 
with  the  world.  Thus,  we  must  become  conscious  of  our  desires,  and  articulate 
them,  and  prioritize  them,  and  arrange  them  into  hierarchies.  That  makes  them 
sophisticated.  That  makes  them  work  with  each  other,  and  with  the  desires  of 
other  people,  and  with  the  world.  It  is  in  that  manner  that  our  desires  elevate 
themselves.  It  is  in  that  manner  that  they  organize  themselves  into  values  and 
become  moral.  Our  values,  our  morality — they  are  indicators  of  our 
sophistication. 

The  philosophical  study  of  morality — of  right  and  wrong — is  ethics.  Such 
study  can  render  us  more  sophisticated  in  our  choices.  Even  older  and  deeper 
than  ethics,  however,  is  religion.  Religion  concerns  itself  not  with  (mere)  right 
and  wrong  but  with  good  and  evil  themselves — with  the  archetypes  of  right  and 
wrong.  Religion  concerns  itself  with  domain  of  value,  ultimate  value.  That  is  not 
the  scientific  domain.  It’s  not  the  territory  of  empirical  description.  The  people 
who  wrote  and  edited  the  Bible,  for  example,  weren’t  scientists.  They  couldn’t 
have  been  scientists,  even  if  they  had  wanted  to  be.  The  viewpoints,  methods  and 
practices  of  science  hadn’t  been  formulated  when  the  Bible  was  written. 

Religion  is  instead  about  proper  behaviour.  It’s  about  what  Plato  called  “the 
Good.”  A  genuine  religious  acolyte  isn’t  trying  to  formulate  accurate  ideas  about 
the  objective  nature  of  the  world  (although  he  may  be  trying  to  do  that  to).  He’s 
striving,  instead,  to  be  a  “good  person.”  It  may  be  the  case  that  to  him  “good” 
means  nothing  but  “obedient” — even  blindly  obedient.  Hence  the  classic  liberal 
Western  enlightenment  objection  to  religious  belief:  obedience  is  not  enough. 

But  it’s  at  least  a  start  (and  we  have  forgotten  this):  You  cannot  aim  yourself  at 
anything  if  you  are  completely  undisciplined  and  untutored.  You  will  not  know 
what  to  target,  and  you  won’t  fly  straight,  even  if  you  somehow  get  your  aim 
right.  And  then  you  will  conclude,  “There  is  nothing  to  aim  for.”  And  then  you 
will  be  lost. 


It  is  therefore  necessary  and  desirable  for  religions  to  have  a  dogmatic 
element.  What  good  is  a  value  system  that  does  not  provide  a  stable  structure? 
What  good  is  a  value  system  that  does  not  point  the  way  to  a  higher  order?  And 
what  good  can  you  possibly  be  if  you  cannot  or  do  not  internalize  that  structure, 
or  accept  that  order — not  as  a  final  destination,  necessarily,  but  at  least  as  a 
starting  point?  Without  that,  you’re  nothing  but  an  adult  two-year-old,  without 
the  charm  or  the  potential.  That  is  not  to  say  (to  say  it  again)  that  obedience  is 
sufficient.  But  a  person  capable  of  obedience — let’s  say,  instead,  a  properly 
disciplined  person — is  at  least  a  well-forged  tool.  At  least  that  (and  that  is  not 
nothing).  Of  course,  there  must  be  vision,  beyond  discipline;  beyond  dogma.  A 
tool  still  needs  a  purpose.  It  is  for  such  reasons  that  Christ  said,  in  the  Gospel  of 
Thomas,  “The  Kingdom  of  the  Father  is  spread  out  upon  the  earth,  but  men  do 
not  see  it.” 

Does  that  mean  that  what  we  see  is  dependent  on  our  religious  beliefs?  Yes! 
And  what  we  don’t  see,  as  well!  You  might  object,  “But  I’m  an  atheist.”  No, 
you’re  not  (and  if  you  want  to  understand  this,  you  could  read  Dostoevsky’s 
Crime  and  Punishment,  perhaps  the  greatest  novel  ever  written,  in  which  the 
main  character,  Raskolnikov,  decides  to  take  his  atheism  with  true  seriousness, 
commits  what  he  has  rationalized  as  a  benevolent  murder,  and  pays  the  price). 
You’re  simply  not  an  atheist  in  your  actions,  and  it  is  your  actions  that  most 
accurately  reflect  your  deepest  beliefs — those  that  are  implicit,  embedded  in 
your  being,  underneath  your  conscious  apprehensions  and  articulable  attitudes 
and  surface-level  self-knowledge.  You  can  only  find  out  what  you  actually 
believe  (rather  than  what  you  think  you  believe)  by  watching  how  you  act.  You 
simply  don’t  know  what  you  believe,  before  that.  You  are  too  complex  to 
understand  yourself. 

It  takes  careful  observation,  and  education,  and  reflection,  and  communication 
with  others,  just  to  scratch  the  surface  of  your  beliefs.  Everything  you  value  is  a 
product  of  unimaginably  lengthy  developmental  processes,  personal,  cultural  and 
biological.  You  don’t  understand  how  what  you  want — and,  therefore,  what  you 
see — is  conditioned  by  the  immense,  abysmal,  profound  past.  You  simply  don’t 
understand  how  every  neural  circuit  through  which  you  peer  at  the  world  has 
been  shaped  (and  painfully)  by  the  ethical  aims  of  millions  of  years  of  human 
ancestors  and  all  of  the  life  that  was  lived  for  the  billions  of  years  before  that. 

You  don’t  understand  anything. 

You  didn’t  even  know  that  you  were  blind. 

Some  of  our  knowledge  of  our  beliefs  has  been  documented.  We  have  been 
watching  ourselves  act,  reflecting  on  that  watching,  and  telling  stories  distilled 
through  that  reflection,  for  tens  and  perhaps  hundreds  of  thousands  of  years. 


That  is  all  part  of  our  attempts,  individual  and  collective,  to  discover  and 
articulate  what  it  is  that  we  believe.  Part  of  the  knowledge  so  generated  is  what 
is  encapsulated  in  the  fundamental  teachings  of  our  cultures,  in  ancient  writings 
such  as  the  Tao  te  Ching,  or  the  aforementioned  Vedic  scriptures,  or  the  Biblical 
stories.  The  Bible  is,  for  better  or  worse,  the  foundational  document  of  Western 
civilization  (of  Western  values,  Western  morality,  and  Western  conceptions  of 
good  and  evil).  It’s  the  product  of  processes  that  remain  fundamentally  beyond 
our  comprehension.  The  Bible  is  a  library  composed  of  many  books,  each 
written  and  edited  by  many  people.  It’s  a  truly  emergent  document — a  selected, 
sequenced  and  finally  coherent  story  written  by  no  one  and  everyone  over  many 
thousands  of  years.  The  Bible  has  been  thrown  up,  out  of  the  deep,  by  the 
collective  human  imagination,  which  is  itself  a  product  of  unimaginable  forces 
operating  over  unfathomable  spans  of  time.  Its  careful,  respectful  study  can 
reveal  things  to  us  about  what  we  believe  and  how  we  do  and  should  act  that  can 
be  discovered  in  almost  no  other  manner. 

Old  Testament  God  and  New  Testament  God 

The  God  of  the  Old  Testament  can  appear  harsh,  judgmental,  unpredictable  and 
dangerous,  particularly  on  cursory  reading.  The  degree  to  which  this  is  true  has 
arguably  been  exaggerated  by  Christian  commentators,  intent  on  magnifying  the 
distinction  between  the  older  and  newer  divisions  of  the  Bible.  There  has  been  a 
price  paid,  however,  for  such  plotting  (and  I  mean  that  in  both  senses  of  the 
word):  the  tendency  for  modern  people  to  think,  when  confronted  with  Jehovah, 
“I  would  never  believe  in  a  God  like  that.”  But  Old  Testament  God  doesn’t  much 
care  what  modern  people  think.  He  often  didn’t  care  what  Old  Testament  people 
thought,  either  (although  He  could  be  bargained  with,  to  a  surprising  degree,  as 
is  particularly  evident  in  the  Abrahamic  stories).  Nonetheless,  when  His  people 
strayed  from  the  path — when  they  disobeyed  His  injunctions,  violated  His 
covenants,  and  broke  His  commandments — trouble  was  certain  to  follow.  If  you 
did  not  do  what  Old  Testament  God  demanded — whatever  that  might  have  been 
and  however  you  might  have  tried  to  hide  from  it — you  and  your  children  and 
your  children’s  children  were  in  terrible,  serious  trouble. 

It  was  realists  who  created,  or  noticed,  Old  Testament  God.  When  the 
denizens  of  those  ancient  societies  wandered  carelessly  down  the  wrong  path, 
they  ended  up  enslaved  and  miserable — sometimes  for  centuries — when  they 
were  not  obliterated  completely.  Was  that  reasonable?  Was  that  just?  Was  that 
fair?  The  authors  of  the  Old  Testament  asked  such  questions  with  extreme 
caution  and  under  very  limited  conditions.  They  assumed,  instead,  that  the 


Creator  of  Being  knew  what  he  was  doing,  that  all  power  was  essentially  with 
Him,  and  that  His  dictates  should  be  carefully  followed.  They  were  wise.  He  was 
a  Force  of  Nature.  Is  a  hungry  lion  reasonable,  fair  or  just?  What  kind  of 
nonsensical  question  is  that?  The  Old  Testament  Israelites  and  their  forebears 
knew  that  God  was  not  to  be  trifled  with,  and  that  whatever  Hell  the  angry  Deity 
might  allow  to  be  engendered  if  he  was  crossed  was  real.  Having  recently  passed 
through  a  century  defined  by  the  bottomless  horrors  of  Hitler,  Stalin,  and  Mao, 
we  might  realize  the  same  thing. 

New  Testament  God  is  often  presented  as  a  different  character  (although  the 
Book  of  Revelation,  with  its  Final  Judgment,  warns  against  any  excessively 
naive  complacency).  He  is  more  the  kindly  Geppetto,  master  craftsman  and 
benevolent  father.  He  wants  nothing  for  us  but  the  best.  He  is  all-loving  and  all- 
forgiving.  Sure,  He’ll  send  you  to  Hell,  if  you  misbehave  badly  enough. 
Fundamentally,  however,  he’s  the  God  of  Love.  That  seems  more  optimistic, 
more  naively  welcoming,  but  (in  precise  proportion  to  that)  less  believable.  In  a 
world  such  as  this — this  hothouse  of  doom — who  could  buy  such  a  story?  The 
all-good  God,  in  a  post- Auschwitz  world?  It  was  for  such  reasons  that  the 
philosopher  Nietzsche,  perhaps  the  most  astute  critic  ever  to  confront 
Christianity,  considered  New  Testament  God  the  worst  literary  crime  in  Western 
history.  In  Beyond  Good  and  Evil,  he  wrote: 

In  the  Jewish  ‘Old  Testament’,  the  book  of  divine  justice,  there  are  men,  things  and  speeches  on 
such  a  grand  style  that  Greek  and  Indian  literature  has  nothing  to  compare  with  it.  One  stands 
with  fear  and  reverence  before  those  stupendous  remains  of  what  man  was  formerly,  and  one 
has  sad  thoughts  about  old  Asia  and  its  little  out-pushed  peninsula  Europe.. . .  To  have  bound  up 
this  New  Testament  (a  kind  of  ROCOCO  of  taste  in  every  respect)  along  with  the  Old  Testament 
into  one  book,  as  the  “Bible,”  as  “The  Book  in  Itself”  is  perhaps  the  greatest  audacity  and  “sin 
against  the  spirit”  which  literary  Europe  has  on  its  conscience. 

Who  but  the  most  naive  among  us  could  posit  that  such  an  all-good,  merciful 
Being  ruled  this  so-terrible  world?  But  something  that  seems  incomprehensible 
to  someone  unseeing  might  be  perfectly  evident  to  someone  who  had  opened  his 
eyes. 

Let’s  return  to  the  situation  where  your  aim  is  being  determined  by  something 
petty — your  aforementioned  envy  of  your  boss.  Because  of  that  envy,  the  world 
you  inhabit  reveals  itself  as  a  place  of  bitterness,  disappointment  and  spite. 
Imagine  that  you  come  to  notice,  and  contemplate,  and  reconsider  your 
unhappiness.  Further,  you  determine  to  accept  responsibility  for  it,  and  dare  to 
posit  that  it  might  be  something  at  least  partly  under  your  control.  You  crack 
open  one  eye,  for  a  moment,  and  look.  You  ask  for  something  better.  You 
sacrifice  your  pettiness,  repent  of  your  envy,  and  open  your  heart.  Instead  of 


cursing  the  darkness,  you  let  in  a  little  light.  You  decide  to  aim  for  a  better  life — 
instead  of  a  better  office. 

But  you  don’t  stop  there.  You  realize  that  it’s  a  mistake  to  aim  for  a  better  life, 
if  it  comes  at  the  cost  of  worsening  someone  else’s.  So,  you  get  creative.  You 
decide  to  play  a  more  difficult  game.  You  decide  that  you  want  a  better  life,  in  a 
manner  that  will  also  make  the  life  of  your  family  better.  Or  the  life  of  your 
family,  and  your  friends.  Or  the  life  of  your  family,  and  your  friends,  and  the 
strangers  who  surround  them.  What  about  your  enemies?  Do  you  want  to  include 
them,  too?  You  bloody  well  don’t  know  how  to  manage  that.  But  you’ve  read 
some  history.  You  know  how  enmity  compounds.  So,  you  start  to  wish  even  your 
enemies  well,  at  least  in  principle,  although  you  are  by  no  means  yet  a  master  of 
such  sentiments. 

And  the  direction  of  your  sight  changes.  You  see  past  the  limitations  that 
hemmed  you  in,  unknowingly.  New  possibilities  for  your  life  emerge,  and  you 
work  toward  their  realization.  Your  life  indeed  improves.  And  then  you  start  to 
think,  further:  “Better?  Perhaps  that  means  better  for  me,  and  my  family,  and  my 
friends — even  for  my  enemies.  But  that’s  not  all  it  means.  It  means  better  today, 
in  a  manner  that  makes  everything  better  tomorrow,  and  next  week,  and  next 
year,  and  a  decade  from  now,  and  a  hundred  years  from  now.  And  a  thousand 
years  from  now.  And  forever.” 

And  then  “better”  means  to  aim  at  the  Improvement  of  Being,  with  a  capital 
“I’  and  a  capital  “B.”  Thinking  all  of  this — realizing  all  of  this — you  take  a  risk. 
You  decide  that  you  will  start  treating  Old  Testament  God,  with  all  His  terrible 
and  oft-arbitrary-seeming  power,  as  if  He  could  also  be  New  Testament  God 
(even  though  you  understand  the  many  ways  in  which  that  is  absurd).  In  other 
words,  you  decide  to  act  as  if  existence  might  be  justified  by  its  goodness — if 
only  you  behaved  properly.  And  it  is  that  decision,  that  declaration  of  existential 
faith,  that  allows  you  to  overcome  nihilism,  and  resentment,  and  arrogance.  It  is 
that  declaration  of  faith  that  keeps  hatred  of  Being,  with  all  its  attendant  evils,  at 
bay.  And,  as  for  such  faith:  it  is  not  at  all  the  will  to  believe  things  that  you  know 
perfectly  well  to  be  false.  Faith  is  not  the  childish  belief  in  magic.  That  is 
ignorance  or  even  willful  blindness.  It  is  instead  the  realization  that  the  tragic 
irrationalities  of  life  must  be  counterbalanced  by  an  equally  irrational 
commitment  to  the  essential  goodness  of  Being.  It  is  simultaneously  the  will  to 
dare  set  your  sights  at  the  unachievable,  and  to  sacrifice  everything,  including 
(and  most  importantly)  your  life.  You  realize  that  you  have,  literally,  nothing 
better  to  do.  But  how  can  you  do  all  this? — assuming  you  are  foolish  enough  to 
try. 


You  might  start  by  not  thinking — or,  more  accurately,  but  less  trenchantly,  by 
refusing  to  subjugate  your  faith  to  your  current  rationality,  and  its  narrowness  of 
view.  This  doesn’t  mean  “make  yourself  stupid.”  It  means  the  opposite.  It  means 
instead  that  you  must  quit  manoeuvring  and  calculating  and  conniving  and 
scheming  and  enforcing  and  demanding  and  avoiding  and  ignoring  and 
punishing.  It  means  you  must  place  your  old  strategies  aside.  It  means,  instead, 
that  you  must  pay  attention,  as  you  may  never  have  paid  attention  before. 

Pay  Attention 

Pay  attention.  Focus  on  your  surroundings,  physical  and  psychological.  Notice 
something  that  bothers  you,  that  concerns  you,  that  will  not  let  you  be,  which 
you  could  fix,  that  you  would  fix.  You  can  find  such  somethings  by  asking 
yourself  (as  if  you  genuinely  want  to  know)  three  questions:  “What  is  it  that  is 
bothering  me?”  “Is  that  something  I  could  fix?”  and  “Would  I  actually  be  willing 
to  fix  it?”  If  you  find  that  the  answer  is  “no,”  to  any  or  all  of  the  questions,  then 
look  elsewhere.  Aim  lower.  Search  until  you  find  something  that  bothers  you, 
that  you  could  fix,  that  you  would  fix,  and  then  fix  it.  That  might  be  enough  for 
the  day. 

Maybe  there  is  a  stack  of  paper  on  your  desk,  and  you  have  been  avoiding  it. 
You  won’t  even  really  look  at  it,  when  you  walk  into  your  room.  There  are 
terrible  things  lurking  there:  tax  forms,  and  bills  and  letters  from  people  wanting 
things  you  aren’t  sure  you  can  deliver.  Notice  your  fear,  and  have  some 
sympathy  for  it.  Maybe  there  are  snakes  in  that  pile  of  paper.  Maybe  you’ll  get 
bitten.  Maybe  there  are  even  hydras  lurking  there.  You’ll  cut  off  one  head,  and 
seven  more  will  grow.  How  could  you  possibly  cope  with  that? 

You  could  ask  yourself,  “Is  there  anything  at  all  that  I  might  be  willing  to  do 
about  that  pile  of  paper?  Would  I  look,  maybe,  at  one  part  of  it?  For  twenty 
minutes?”  Maybe  the  answer  will  be,  “No!”  But  you  might  look  for  ten,  or  even 
for  five  (and  if  not  that,  for  one).  Start  there.  You  will  soon  find  that  the  entire 
pile  shrinks  in  significance,  merely  because  you  have  looked  at  part  of  it.  And 
you’ll  find  that  the  whole  thing  is  made  of  parts.  What  if  you  allowed  yourself  a 
glass  of  wine  with  dinner,  or  curled  up  on  the  sofa  and  read,  or  watched  a  stupid 
movie,  as  a  reward?  What  if  you  instructed  your  wife,  or  your  husband,  to  say 
“good  job”  after  you  fixed  whatever  you  fixed?  Would  that  motivate  you?  The 
people  from  whom  thanks  you  want  might  not  be  very  proficient  in  offering  it,  to 
begin  with,  but  that  shouldn’t  stop  you.  People  can  learn,  even  if  they  are  very 
unskilled  at  the  beginning.  Ask  yourself  what  you  would  require  to  be  motivated 
to  undertake  the  job,  honestly,  and  listen  to  the  answer.  Don’t  tell  yourself,  “I 


shouldn’t  need  to  do  that  to  motivate  myself.”  What  do  you  know  about 
yourself?  You  are,  on  the  one  hand,  the  most  complex  thing  in  the  entire 
universe,  and  on  the  other,  someone  who  can’t  even  set  the  clock  on  your 
microwave.  Don’t  over-estimate  your  self-knowledge. 

Let  the  tasks  for  the  day  announce  themselves  for  your  contemplation.  Maybe 
you  can  do  this  in  the  morning,  as  you  sit  on  the  edge  of  your  bed.  Maybe  you 
can  try,  the  night  before,  when  you  are  preparing  to  sleep.  Ask  yourself  for  a 
voluntary  contribution.  If  you  ask  nicely,  and  listen  carefully,  and  don’t  try  any 
treachery,  you  might  be  offered  one.  Do  this  every  day,  for  a  while.  Then  do  it 
for  the  rest  of  your  life.  Soon  you  will  find  yourself  in  a  different  situation.  Now 
you  will  be  asking  yourself,  habitually,  “What  could  I  do,  that  I  would  do,  to 
make  Life  a  little  better?”  You  are  not  dictating  to  yourself  what  “better”  must 
be.  You  are  not  being  a  totalitarian,  or  a  utopian,  even  to  yourself,  because  you 
have  learned  from  the  Nazis  and  the  Soviets  and  the  Maoists  and  from  your  own 
experience  that  being  a  totalitarian  is  a  bad  thing.  Aim  high.  Set  your  sights  on 
the  betterment  of  Being.  Align  yourself,  in  your  soul,  with  Truth  and  the  Highest 
Good.  There  is  habitable  order  to  establish  and  beauty  to  bring  into  existence. 
There  is  evil  to  overcome,  suffering  to  ameliorate,  and  yourself  to  better. 

It  is  this,  in  my  reading,  that  is  the  culminating  ethic  of  the  canon  of  the  West. 
It  is  this,  furthermore,  that  is  communicated  by  those  eternally  confusing, 
glowing  stanzas  from  Christ’s  Sermon  on  the  Mount,  the  essence,  in  some  sense, 
of  the  wisdom  of  the  New  Testament.  This  is  the  attempt  of  the  Spirit  of 
Mankind  to  transform  the  understanding  of  ethics  from  the  initial,  necessary 
Thou  Shalt  Not  of  the  child  and  the  Ten  Commandments  into  the  fully 
articulated,  positive  vision  of  the  true  individual.  This  is  the  expression  not 
merely  of  admirable  self-control  and  self-mastery  but  of  the  fundamental  desire 
to  set  the  world  right.  This  is  not  the  cessation  of  sin,  but  sin’s  opposite,  good 
itself.  The  Sermon  on  the  Mount  outlines  the  true  nature  of  man,  and  the  proper 
aim  of  mankind:  concentrate  on  the  day,  so  that  you  can  live  in  the  present,  and 
attend  completely  and  properly  to  what  is  right  in  front  of  you — but  do  that  only 
after  you  have  decided  to  let  what  is  within  shine  forth,  so  that  it  can  justify 
Being  and  illuminate  the  world.  Do  that  only  after  you  have  determined  to 
sacrifice  whatever  it  is  that  must  be  sacrificed  so  that  you  can  pursue  the  highest 
good. 

Consider  the  lilies  of  the  field,  how  they  grow;  they  toil  not,  neither  do  they  spin: 

And  yet  I  say  unto  you,  That  even  Solomon  in  all  his  glory  was  not  arrayed  like  one  of  these. 

Wherefore,  if  God  so  clothe  the  grass  of  the  field,  which  to  day  is,  and  to  morrow  is  cast  into 
the  oven,  shall  he  not  much  more  clothe  you,  O  ye  of  little  faith? 

Therefore  take  no  thought,  saying,  What  shall  we  eat?  or,  What  shall  we  drink?  or, 

Wherewithal  shall  we  be  clothed? 


(For  after  all  these  things  do  the  Gentiles  seek:)  for  your  heavenly  Father  knoweth  that  ye 
have  need  of  all  these  things. 

But  seek  ye  first  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  his  righteousness;  and  all  these  things  shall  be 
added  unto  you. 

Take  therefore  no  thought  for  the  morrow:  for  the  morrow  shall  take  thought  for  the  things  of 
itself.  Sufficient  unto  the  day  is  the  evil  thereof.  (Luke  12:  22-34) 

Realization  is  dawning.  Instead  of  playing  the  tyrant,  therefore,  you  are  paying 
attention.  You  are  telling  the  truth,  instead  of  manipulating  the  world.  You  are 
negotiating,  instead  of  playing  the  martyr  or  the  tyrant.  You  no  longer  have  to  be 
envious,  because  you  no  longer  know  that  someone  else  truly  has  it  better.  You 
no  longer  have  to  be  frustrated,  because  you  have  learned  to  aim  low,  and  to  be 
patient.  You  are  discovering  who  you  are,  and  what  you  want,  and  what  you  are 
willing  to  do.  You  are  finding  that  the  solutions  to  your  particular  problems  have 
to  be  tailored  to  you,  personally  and  precisely.  You  are  less  concerned  with  the 
actions  of  other  people,  because  you  have  plenty  to  do  yourself. 

Attend  to  the  day,  but  aim  at  the  highest  good. 

Now,  your  trajectory  is  heavenward.  That  makes  you  hopeful.  Even  a  man  on 
a  sinking  ship  can  be  happy  when  he  clambers  aboard  a  lifeboat!  And  who 
knows  where  he  might  go,  in  the  future.  To  journey  happily  may  well  be  better 
than  to  arrive  successfully.. . . 

Ask,  and  ye  shall  receive.  Knock,  and  the  door  will  open.  If  you  ask,  as  if  you 
want,  and  knock,  as  if  you  want  to  enter,  you  may  be  offered  the  chance  to 
improve  your  life,  a  little;  a  lot;  completely — and  with  that  improvement,  some 
progress  will  be  made  in  Being  itself. 

Compare  yourself  to  who  you  were  yesterday,  not  to  who  someone  else  is 
today.

RULE  5 


DO  NOT  LET  YOUR  CHILDREN  DO  ANYTHING  THAT 
MAKES  YOU  DISLIKE  THEM 

ACTUALLY,  IT’S  NOT  OK 

Recently,  I  watched  a  three-year-old  boy  trail  his  mother  and  father  slowly 
through  a  crowded  airport.  He  was  screaming  violently  at  five-second  intervals 
— and,  more  important,  he  was  doing  it  voluntarily.  He  wasn’t  at  the  end  of  this 
tether.  As  a  parent,  I  could  tell  from  the  tone.  He  was  irritating  his  parents  and 
hundreds  of  other  people  to  gain  attention.  Maybe  he  needed  something.  But  that 
was  no  way  to  get  it,  and  his  parents  should  have  let  him  know  that.  You  might 
object  that  “perhaps  they  were  worn  out,  and  jet-lagged,  after  a  long  trip.”  But 
thirty  seconds  of  carefully  directed  problem-solving  would  have  brought  the 
shameful  episode  to  a  halt.  More  thoughtful  parents  would  not  have  let  someone 
they  truly  cared  for  become  the  object  of  a  crowd’s  contempt. 

I  have  also  watched  a  couple,  unable  or  unwilling  to  say  no  to  their  two-year- 
old,  obliged  to  follow  closely  behind  him  everywhere  he  went,  every  moment  of 
what  was  supposed  to  be  an  enjoyable  social  visit,  because  he  misbehaved  so 
badly  when  not  micro-managed  that  he  could  not  be  given  a  second  of  genuine 
freedom  without  risk.  The  desire  of  his  parents  to  let  their  child  act  without 
correction  on  every  impulse  perversely  produced  precisely  the  opposite  effect: 
they  deprived  him  instead  of  every  opportunity  to  engage  in  independent  action. 
Because  they  did  not  dare  to  teach  him  what  “No”  means,  he  had  no  conception 
of  the  reasonable  limits  enabling  maximal  toddler  autonomy.  It  was  a  classic 
example  of  too  much  chaos  breeding  too  much  order  (and  the  inevitable 
reversal).  I  have,  similarly,  seen  parents  rendered  unable  to  engage  in  adult 
conversation  at  a  dinner  party  because  their  children,  four  and  five,  dominated 
the  social  scene,  eating  the  centres  out  of  all  the  sliced  bread,  subjecting 
everyone  to  their  juvenile  tyranny,  while  mom  and  dad  watched,  embarrassed 
and  bereft  of  the  ability  to  intervene. 

When  my  now-adult  daughter  was  a  child,  another  child  once  hit  her  on  the 
head  with  a  metal  toy  truck.  I  watched  that  same  child,  one  year  later,  viciously 
push  his  younger  sister  backwards  over  a  fragile  glass-surfaced  coffee  table.  His 
mother  picked  him  up,  immediately  afterward  (but  not  her  frightened  daughter), 
and  told  him  in  hushed  tones  not  to  do  such  things,  while  she  patted  him 
comfortingly  in  a  manner  clearly  indicative  of  approval.  She  was  out  to  produce 


a  little  God-Emperor  of  the  Universe.  That’s  the  unstated  goal  of  many  a  mother, 
including  many  who  consider  themselves  advocates  for  full  gender  equality. 

Such  women  will  object  vociferously  to  any  command  uttered  by  an  adult  male, 
but  will  trot  off  in  seconds  to  make  their  progeny  a  peanut-butter  sandwich  if  he 
demands  it  while  immersed  self-importantly  in  a  video  game.  The  future  mates 
of  such  boys  have  every  reason  to  hate  their  mothers-in-law.  Respect  for 
women?  That’s  for  other  boys,  other  men — not  for  their  dear  sons. 

Something  of  the  same  sort  may  underlie,  in  part,  the  preference  for  male 
children  seen  most  particularly  in  places  such  as  India,  Pakistan  and  China, 
where  sex-selective  abortion  is  widely  practised.  The  Wikipedia  entry  for  that 
practice  attributes  its  existence  to  “cultural  norms”  favouring  male  over  female 
children.  (I  cite  Wikipedia  because  it  is  collectively  written  and  edited  and, 
therefore,  the  perfect  place  to  find  accepted  wisdom.)  But  there’s  no  evidence 
that  such  ideas  are  strictly  cultural.  There  are  plausible  psycho-biological 
reasons  for  the  evolution  of  such  an  attitude,  and  they’re  not  pretty,  from  a 
modern,  egalitarian  perspective.  If  circumstances  force  you  to  put  all  your  eggs 
into  one  basket,  so  to  speak,  a  son  is  a  better  bet,  by  the  strict  standards  of 
evolutionary  logic,  where  the  proliferation  of  your  genes  is  all  that  matters. 

Why? 

Well,  a  reproductively  successful  daughter  might  gain  you  eight  or  nine 
children.  The  Holocaust  survivor  Yitta  Schwartz,  a  star  in  this  regard,  had  three 
generations  of  direct  descendants  who  matched  such  performance.  She  was  the 
ancestor  of  almost  two  thousand  people  by  the  time  of  her  death  in  2010.  But 
the  sky  is  truly  the  limit  with  a  reproductively  successful  son.  Sex  with  multiple 
female  partners  is  his  ticket  to  exponential  reproduction  (given  our  species’ 
practical  limitation  to  single  births).  Rumour  has  it  that  the  actor  Warren  Beatty 
and  the  athlete  Wilt  Chamberlain  each  bedded  multiple  thousands  of  women 
(something  not  unknown,  as  well,  among  rock  stars).  They  didn’t  produce 
children  in  those  numbers.  Modern  birth  control  limits  that.  But  similar  celebrity 
types  in  the  past  have  done  so.  The  forefather  of  the  Qing  dynasty,  Giocangga 
(circa  1550),  for  example,  is  the  male-line  ancestor  of  a  million  and  a  half  people 
in  northeastern  China.  The  medieval  Ui  Neill  dynasty  produced  up  to  three 
million  male  descendants,  localized  mainly  in  northwestern  Ireland  and  the  US, 
through  Irish  emigration.  And  the  king  of  them  all,  Genghis  Khan,  conqueror 
of  much  of  Asia,  is  forefather  of  8  percent  of  the  men  in  Central  Asia — sixteen 
million  male  descendants,  34  generations  later.  So,  from  a  deep,  biological 
perspective  there  are  reasons  why  parents  might  favour  sons  sufficiently  to 


eliminate  female  fetuses,  although  I  am  not  claiming  direct  causality,  nor 
suggesting  a  lack  of  other,  more  culturally-dependent  reasons. 

Preferential  treatment  awarded  a  son  during  development  might  even  help 
produce  an  attractive,  well-rounded,  confident  man.  This  happened  in  the  case  of 
the  father  of  psychoanalysis,  Sigmund  Freud,  by  his  own  account:  “A  man  who 
has  been  the  indisputable  favorite  of  his  mother  keeps  for  life  the  feeling  of  a 
conqueror,  that  confidence  of  success  that  often  induces  real  success.”  Fair 
enough.  But  “feeling  of  a  conqueror”  can  all  too  easily  become  “actual 
conqueror.”  Genghis  Khan’s  outstanding  reproductive  success  certainly  came  at 
the  cost  of  any  success  whatsoever  for  others  (including  the  dead  millions  of 
Chinese,  Persians,  Russians  and  Hungarians).  Spoiling  a  son  might  therefore 
work  well  from  the  standpoint  of  the  “selfish  gene”  (allowing  the  favoured 
child’s  genes  to  replicate  themselves  in  innumerable  offspring),  to  use  the 
evolutionary  biologist  Richard  Dawkins’  famous  expression.  But  it  can  make  for 
a  dark,  painful  spectacle  in  the  here  and  now,  and  mutate  into  something 
indescribably  dangerous. 

None  of  this  means  that  all  mothers  favour  all  sons  over  their  daughters  (or 
that  daughters  are  not  sometimes  favoured  over  sons,  or  that  fathers  don’t 
sometimes  favor  their  sons).  Other  factors  can  clearly  dominate.  Sometimes,  for 
example,  unconscious  hatred  (sometimes  not-so-unconscious,  either)  overrides 
any  concern  a  parent  might  have  for  any  child,  regardless  of  gender  or 
personality  or  situation.  I  saw  a  four-year  old  boy  allowed  to  go  hungry  on  a 
regular  basis.  His  nanny  had  been  injured,  and  he  was  being  cycled  through  the 
neighbours  for  temporary  care.  When  his  mother  dropped  him  off  at  our  house, 
she  indicated  that  he  wouldn’t  eat  at  all,  all  day.  “That’s  OK,”  she  said.  It  wasn’t 
OK  (in  case  that’s  not  obvious).  This  was  the  same  four-year-old  boy  who  clung 
to  my  wife  for  hours  in  absolute  desperation  and  total  commitment,  when  she 
tenaciously,  persistently  and  mercifully  managed  to  feed  him  an  entire  lunch¬ 
time  meal,  rewarding  him  throughout  for  his  cooperation,  and  refusing  to  let  him 
fail.  He  started  out  with  a  closed  mouth,  sitting  with  all  of  us  at  the  dining  room 
table,  my  wife  and  I,  our  two  kids,  and  two  neighbourhood  kids  we  looked  after 
during  the  day.  She  put  the  spoon  in  front  of  him,  waiting  patiently,  persistently, 
while  he  moved  his  head  back  and  forth,  refusing  it  entry,  using  defensive 
methods  typical  of  a  recalcitrant  and  none-too-well-attended  two-year  old. 

She  didn’t  let  him  fail.  She  patted  him  on  the  head  every  time  he  managed  a 
mouthful,  telling  him  sincerely  that  he  was  a  “good  boy”  when  he  did  so.  She 
did  think  he  was  a  good  boy.  He  was  a  cute,  damaged  kid.  Ten  not-too-painful 
minutes  later  he  finished  his  meal.  We  were  all  watching  intently.  It  was  a  drama 
of  life  and  death. 


“Look,”  she  said,  holding  up  his  bowl.  “You  finished  all  of  it.”  This  boy,  who 
was  standing  in  the  corner,  voluntarily  and  unhappily,  when  I  first  saw  him;  who 
wouldn’t  interact  with  the  other  kids,  who  frowned  chronically,  who  wouldn’t 
respond  to  me  when  I  tickled  and  prodded  him,  trying  to  get  him  to  play — this 
boy  broke  immediately  into  a  wide,  radiant  smile.  It  brought  joy  to  everyone  at 
the  table.  Twenty  years  later,  writing  it  down  today,  it  still  brings  me  to  tears. 
Afterward,  he  followed  my  wife  around  like  a  puppy  for  the  rest  of  the  day, 
refusing  to  let  her  out  of  his  sight.  When  she  sat  down,  he  jumped  in  her  lap, 
cuddling  in,  opening  himself  back  up  to  the  world,  searching  desperately  for  the 
love  he  had  been  continually  denied.  Later  in  the  day,  but  far  too  soon,  his 
mother  reappeared.  She  came  down  the  stairs  into  the  room  we  all  occupied. 

“Oh,  SuperMom,”  she  uttered,  resentfully,  seeing  her  son  curled  up  in  my  wife’s 
lap.  Then  she  departed,  black,  murderous  heart  unchanged,  doomed  child  in 
hand.  She  was  a  psychologist.  The  things  you  can  see,  with  even  a  single  open 
eye.  It’s  no  wonder  that  people  want  to  stay  blind. 

Everybody  Hates  Arithmetic 

My  clinical  clients  frequently  come  to  me  to  discuss  their  day-to-day  familial 
problems.  Such  quotidian  concerns  are  insidious.  Their  habitual  and  predictable 
occurrence  makes  them  appear  trivial.  But  that  appearance  of  triviality  is 
deceptive:  it  is  the  things  that  occur  every  single  day  that  truly  make  up  our 
lives,  and  time  spent  the  same  way  over  and  again  adds  up  at  an  alarming  rate. 
One  father  recently  spoke  with  me  about  the  trouble  he  was  having  putting  his 
son  to  sleep  at  night fnl  — a  ritual  that  typically  involved  about  three-quarters  of  an 
hour  of  fighting.  We  did  the  arithmetic.  Forty-five  minutes  a  day,  seven  days  a 
week — that’s  three  hundred  minutes,  or  five  hours,  a  week.  Five  hours  for  each 
of  the  four  weeks  of  a  month — that’s  twenty  hours  per  month.  Twenty  hours  a 
month  for  twelve  months  is  two  hundred  and  forty  hours  a  year.  That’s  a  month 
and  a  half  of  standard  forty-hour  work  weeks. 

My  client  was  spending  a  month  and  a  half  of  work  weeks  per  year  fighting 
ineffectually  and  miserably  with  his  son.  Needless  to  say,  both  were  suffering  for 
it.  No  matter  how  good  your  intentions,  or  how  sweet  and  tolerant  your 
temperament,  you  will  not  maintain  good  relations  with  someone  you  fight  with 
for  a  month  and  a  half  of  work  weeks  per  year.  Resentment  will  inevitably  build. 
Even  if  it  doesn’t,  all  that  wasted,  unpleasant  time  could  clearly  be  spent  in  more 
productive  and  useful  and  less  stressful  and  more  enjoyable  activity.  How  are 
such  situations  to  be  understood?  Where  does  the  fault  lie,  in  child  or  in  parent? 
In  nature  or  society?  And  what,  if  anything,  is  to  be  done? 


Some  localize  all  such  problems  in  the  adult,  whether  in  the  parent  or  broader 
society.  “There  are  no  bad  children,”  such  people  think,  “only  bad  parents.” 
When  the  idealized  image  of  an  unsullied  child  is  brought  to  mind,  this  notion 
appears  fully  justified.  The  beauty,  openness,  joy,  trust  and  capacity  for  love 
characterizing  children  makes  it  easy  to  attribute  full  culpability  to  the  adults  on 
the  scene.  But  such  an  attitude  is  dangerously  and  naively  romantic.  It’s  too  one¬ 
sided,  in  the  case  of  parents  granted  a  particularly  difficult  son  or  daughter.  It’s 
also  not  for  the  best  that  all  human  corruption  is  uncritically  laid  at  society’s  feet. 
That  conclusion  merely  displaces  the  problem,  back  in  time.  It  explains  nothing, 
and  solves  no  problems.  If  society  is  corrupt,  but  not  the  individuals  within  it, 
then  where  did  the  corruption  originate?  How  is  it  propagated?  It’s  a  one-sided, 
deeply  ideological  theory. 

Even  more  problematic  is  the  insistence  logically  stemming  from  this 
presumption  of  social  corruption  that  all  individual  problems,  no  matter  how 
rare,  must  be  solved  by  cultural  restructuring,  no  matter  how  radical.  Our  society 
faces  the  increasing  call  to  deconstruct  its  stabilizing  traditions  to  include 
smaller  and  smaller  numbers  of  people  who  do  not  or  will  not  fit  into  the 
categories  upon  which  even  our  perceptions  are  based.  This  is  not  a  good  thing. 
Each  person’s  private  trouble  cannot  be  solved  by  a  social  revolution,  because 
revolutions  are  destabilizing  and  dangerous.  We  have  learned  to  live  together 
and  organize  our  complex  societies  slowly  and  incrementally,  over  vast  stretches 
of  time,  and  we  do  not  understand  with  sufficient  exactitude  why  what  we  are 
doing  works.  Thus,  altering  our  ways  of  social  being  carelessly  in  the  name  of 
some  ideological  shibboleth  (diversity  springs  to  mind)  is  likely  to  produce  far 
more  trouble  than  good,  given  the  suffering  that  even  small  revolutions  generally 
produce. 

Was  it  really  a  good  thing,  for  example,  to  so  dramatically  liberalize  the 
divorce  laws  in  the  1960s?  It’s  not  clear  to  me  that  the  children  whose  lives  were 
destabilized  by  the  hypothetical  freedom  this  attempt  at  liberation  introduced 
would  say  so.  Horror  and  terror  lurk  behind  the  walls  provided  so  wisely  by  our 
ancestors.  We  tear  them  down  at  our  peril.  We  skate,  unconsciously,  on  thin  ice, 
with  deep,  cold  waters  below,  where  unimaginable  monsters  lurk. 

I  see  today’s  parents  as  terrified  by  their  children,  not  least  because  they  have 
been  deemed  the  proximal  agents  of  this  hypothetical  social  tyranny,  and 
simultaneously  denied  credit  for  their  role  as  benevolent  and  necessary  agents  of 
discipline,  order  and  conventionality.  They  dwell  uncomfortably  and  self¬ 
consciously  in  the  shadow  of  the  all-too-powerful  shadow  of  the  adolescent 
ethos  of  the  1960s,  a  decade  whose  excesses  led  to  a  general  denigration  of 
adulthood,  an  unthinking  disbelief  in  the  existence  of  competent  power,  and  the 


inability  to  distinguish  between  the  chaos  of  immaturity  and  responsible 
freedom.  This  has  increased  parental  sensitivity  to  the  short-term  emotional 
suffering  of  their  children,  while  heightening  their  fear  of  damaging  their 
children  to  a  painful  and  counterproductive  degree.  Better  this  than  the  reverse, 
you  might  argue — but  there  are  catastrophes  lurking  at  the  extremes  of  every 
moral  continuum. 

The  Ignoble  Savage 

It  has  been  said  that  every  individual  is  the  conscious  or  unconscious  follower  of 
some  influential  philosopher.  The  belief  that  children  have  an  intrinsically 
unsullied  spirit,  damaged  only  by  culture  and  society,  is  derived  in  no  small  part 
from  the  eighteenth-century  Genevan  French  philosopher  Jean-Jacques 
Rousseau.  Rousseau  was  a  fervent  believer  in  the  corrupting  influence  of 
human  society  and  private  ownership  alike.  He  claimed  that  nothing  was  so 
gentle  and  wonderful  as  man  in  his  pre-civilized  state.  At  precisely  the  same 
time,  noting  his  inability  as  a  father,  he  abandoned  five  of  his  children  to  the 
tender  and  fatal  mercies  of  the  orphanages  of  the  time. 

The  noble  savage  Rousseau  described,  however,  was  an  ideal — an  abstraction, 
archetypal  and  religious — and  not  the  flesh-and-blood  reality  he  supposed.  The 
mythologically  perfect  Divine  Child  permanently  inhabits  our  imagination.  He’s 
the  potential  of  youth,  the  newborn  hero,  the  wronged  innocent,  and  the  long-lost 
son  of  the  rightful  king.  He’s  the  intimations  of  immortality  that  accompany  our 
earliest  experiences.  He’s  Adam,  the  perfect  man,  walking  without  sin  with  God 
in  the  Garden  before  the  Fall.  But  human  beings  are  evil,  as  well  as  good,  and 
the  darkness  that  dwells  forever  in  our  souls  is  also  there  in  no  small  part  in  our 
younger  selves.  In  general,  people  improve  with  age,  rather  than  worsening, 
becoming  kinder,  more  conscientious,  and  more  emotionally  stable  as  they 
mature.  Bullying  at  the  sheer  and  often  terrible  intensity  of  the  schoolyard 
rarely  manifests  itself  in  grown-up  society.  William  Golding’s  dark  and 
anarchistic  Lord  of  the  Flies  is  a  classic  for  a  reason. 

Furthermore,  there  is  plenty  of  direct  evidence  that  the  horrors  of  human 
behaviour  cannot  be  so  easily  attributed  to  history  and  society.  This  was 
discovered  most  painfully,  perhaps,  by  the  primatologist  Jane  Goodall,  beginning 
in  1974,  when  she  learned  that  her  beloved  chimpanzees  were  capable  of  and 
willing  to  murder  each  other  (to  use  the  terminology  appropriate  to  humans). 
Because  of  its  shocking  nature  and  great  anthropological  significance,  she  kept 
her  observations  secret  for  years,  fearing  that  her  contact  with  the  animals  had 


led  them  to  manifest  unnatural  behaviour.  Even  after  she  published  her  account, 
many  refused  to  believe  it.  It  soon  became  obvious,  however,  that  what  she 
observed  was  by  no  means  rare. 

Bluntly  put:  chimpanzees  conduct  inter-tribal  warfare.  Furthermore,  they  do  it 
with  almost  unimaginable  brutality.  The  typical  full-grown  chimp  is  more  than 
twice  as  strong  as  a  comparable  human  being,  despite  their  smaller  size. 

Goodall  reported  with  some  terror  the  proclivity  of  the  chimps  she  studied  to 
snap  strong  steel  cables  and  levers.  Chimps  can  literally  tear  each  other  to 
pieces — and  they  do.  Human  societies  and  their  complex  technologies  cannot  be 
blamed  for  that.  “Often  when  I  woke  in  the  night,”  she  wrote,  “horrific  pictures 
sprang  unbidden  to  my  mind — Satan  [a  long-observed  chimp]  cupping  his  hand 
below  Sniff’s  chin  to  drink  the  blood  that  welled  from  a  great  wound  in  his  face 
...  Jomeo  tearing  a  strip  of  skin  from  De’s  thigh;  Figan,  charging  and  hitting, 
again  and  again,  the  stricken,  quivering  body  of  Goliath,  one  of  his  childhood 
heroes.”  Small  gangs  of  adolescent  chimps,  mostly  male,  roam  the  borders  of 
their  territory.  If  they  encounter  foreigners  (even  chimps  they  once  knew,  who 
had  broken  away  from  the  now-too-large  group)  and,  if  they  outnumber  them, 
the  gang  will  mob  and  destroy  them,  without  mercy.  Chimps  don’t  have  much  of 
a  super-ego,  and  it  is  prudent  to  remember  that  the  human  capacity  for  self- 
control  may  also  be  overestimated.  Careful  perusal  of  book  as  shocking  and 
horrific  as  Iris  Chang’s  The  Rape  of  Nanking,  which  describes  the  brutal 
decimation  of  that  Chinese  city  by  the  invading  Japanese,  will  disenchant  even  a 
committed  romantic.  And  the  less  said  about  Unit  731,  a  covert  Japanese 
biological  warfare  research  unit  established  at  that  time,  the  better.  Read  about  it 
at  your  peril.  You  have  been  warned. 

Hunter-gatherers,  too,  are  much  more  murderous  than  their  urban, 
industrialized  counterparts,  despite  their  communal  lives  and  localized  cultures. 
The  yearly  rate  of  homicide  in  the  modern  UK  is  about  1  per  100,000.  It’s  four 
to  five  times  higher  in  the  US,  and  about  ninety  times  higher  in  Honduras,  which 
has  the  highest  rate  recorded  of  any  modern  nation.  But  the  evidence  strongly 
suggests  that  human  beings  have  become  more  peaceful,  rather  than  less  so,  as 
time  has  progressed  and  societies  became  larger  and  more  organized.  The  !Kung 
bushmen  of  Africa,  romanticized  in  the  1950s  by  Elizabeth  Marshall  Thomas  as 
“the  harmless  people,”  had  a  yearly  murder  rate  of  40  per  100,000,  which 
declined  by  more  than  30%  once  they  became  subject  to  state  authority.  This  is 
a  very  instructive  example  of  complex  social  structures  serving  to  reduce,  not 
exacerbate,  the  violent  tendencies  of  human  beings.  Yearly  rates  of  300  per 
100,000  have  been  reported  for  the  Yanomami  of  Brazil,  famed  for  their 


aggression — but  the  stats  don’t  max  out  there.  The  denizens  of  Papua,  New 
Guinea,  kill  each  other  at  yearly  rates  ranging  from  140  to  1000  per  100,000. 
However,  the  record  appears  to  be  held  by  the  Kato,  an  indigeneous  people  of 
California,  1450  of  whom  per  100,000  met  a  violent  death  circa  1840. 

Because  children,  like  other  human  beings,  are  not  only  good,  they  cannot 
simply  be  left  to  their  own  devices,  untouched  by  society,  and  bloom  into 
perfection.  Even  dogs  must  be  socialized  if  they  are  to  become  acceptable 
members  of  the  pack — and  children  are  much  more  complex  than  dogs.  This 
means  that  they  are  much  more  likely  to  go  complexly  astray  if  they  are  not 
trained,  disciplined  and  properly  encouraged.  This  means  that  it  is  not  just  wrong 
to  attribute  all  the  violent  tendencies  of  human  beings  to  the  pathologies  of 
social  structure.  It’s  wrong  enough  to  be  virtually  backward.  The  vital  process  of 
socialization  prevents  much  harm  and  fosters  much  good.  Children  must  be 
shaped  and  informed,  or  they  cannot  thrive.  This  fact  is  reflected  starkly  in  their 
behavior:  kids  are  utterly  desperate  for  attention  from  both  peers  and  adults 
because  such  attention,  which  renders  them  effective  and  sophisticated 
communal  players,  is  vitally  necessary. 

Children  can  be  damaged  as  much  or  more  by  a  lack  of  incisive  attention  as 
they  are  by  abuse,  mental  or  physical.  This  is  damage  by  omission,  rather  than 
commission,  but  it  is  no  less  severe  and  long-lasting.  Children  are  damaged 
when  their  “mercifully”  inattentive  parents  fail  to  make  them  sharp  and 
observant  and  awake  and  leave  them,  instead,  in  an  unconscious  and 
undifferentiated  state.  Children  are  damaged  when  those  charged  with  their  care, 
afraid  of  any  conflict  or  upset,  no  longer  dare  to  correct  them,  and  leave  them 
without  guidance.  I  can  recognize  such  children  on  the  street.  They  are  doughy 
and  unfocused  and  vague.  They  are  leaden  and  dull  instead  of  golden  and  bright. 
They  are  uncarved  blocks,  trapped  in  a  perpetual  state  of  waiting-to-be. 

Such  children  are  chronically  ignored  by  their  peers.  This  is  because  they  are 
not  fun  to  play  with.  Adults  tend  to  manifest  the  same  attitude  (although  they 
will  deny  it  desperately  when  pressed).  When  I  worked  in  daycare  centres,  early 
in  my  career,  the  comparatively  neglected  children  would  come  to  me 
desperately,  in  their  fumbling,  half-formed  manner,  with  no  sense  of  proper 
distance  and  no  attentive  playfulness.  They  would  flop,  nearby — or  directly  on 
my  lap,  no  matter  what  I  was  doing — driven  inexorably  by  the  powerful  desire 
for  adult  attention,  the  necessary  catalyst  for  further  development.  It  was  very 
difficult  not  to  react  with  annoyance,  even  disgust,  to  such  children  and  their  too- 
prolonged  infantilism — difficult  not  to  literally  push  them  aside — even  though  I 
felt  very  badly  for  them,  and  understood  their  predicament  well.  I  believe  that 


response,  harsh  and  terrible  though  it  may  be,  was  an  almost  universally- 
experienced  internal  warning  signal  indicating  the  comparative  danger  of 
establishing  a  relationship  with  a  poorly  socialized  child:  the  likelihood  of 
immediate  and  inappropriate  dependence  (which  should  have  been  the 
responsibility  of  the  parent)  and  the  tremendous  demand  of  time  and  resources 
that  accepting  such  dependence  would  necessitate.  Confronted  with  such  a 
situation,  potentially  friendly  peers  and  interested  adults  are  much  more  likely  to 
turn  their  attention  to  interacting  with  other  children  whose  cost/benefit  ratio,  to 
speak  bluntly,  would  be  much  lower. 

Parent  or  Friend 

The  neglect  and  mistreatment  that  is  part  and  parcel  of  poorly  structured  or  even 
entirely  absent  disciplinary  approaches  can  be  deliberate — motivated  by  explicit, 
conscious  (if  misguided)  parental  motives.  But  more  often  than  not,  modern 
parents  are  simply  paralyzed  by  the  fear  that  they  will  no  longer  be  liked  or  even 
loved  by  their  children  if  they  chastise  them  for  any  reason.  They  want  their 
children’s  friendship  above  all,  and  are  willing  to  sacrifice  respect  to  get  it.  This 
is  not  good.  A  child  will  have  many  friends,  but  only  two  parents — if  that — and 
parents  are  more,  not  less,  than  friends.  Friends  have  very  limited  authority  to 
correct.  Every  parent  therefore  needs  to  learn  to  tolerate  the  momentary  anger  or 
even  hatred  directed  towards  them  by  their  children,  after  necessary  corrective 
action  has  been  taken,  as  the  capacity  of  children  to  perceive  or  care  about  long¬ 
term  consequences  is  very  limited.  Parents  are  the  arbiters  of  society.  They  teach 
children  how  to  behave  so  that  other  people  will  be  able  to  interact  meaningfully 
and  productively  with  them. 

It  is  an  act  of  responsibility  to  discipline  a  child.  It  is  not  anger  at  misbehavior. 
It  is  not  revenge  for  a  misdeed.  It  is  instead  a  careful  combination  of  mercy  and 
long-term  judgment.  Proper  discipline  requires  effort — indeed,  is  virtually 
synonymous  with  effort.  It  is  difficult  to  pay  careful  attention  to  children.  It  is 
difficult  to  figure  out  what  is  wrong  and  what  is  right  and  why.  It  is  difficult  to 
formulate  just  and  compassionate  strategies  of  discipline,  and  to  negotiate  their 
application  with  others  deeply  involved  in  a  child’s  care.  Because  of  this 
combination  of  responsibility  and  difficulty,  any  suggestion  that  all  constraints 
placed  on  children  are  damaging  can  be  perversely  welcome.  Such  a  notion, 
once  accepted,  allows  adults  who  should  know  better  to  abandon  their  duty  to 
serve  as  agents  of  enculturation  and  pretend  that  doing  so  is  good  for  children. 
It’s  a  deep  and  pernicious  act  of  self-deception.  It’s  lazy,  cruel  and  inexcusable. 
And  our  proclivity  to  rationalize  does  not  end  there. 


We  assume  that  rules  will  irremediably  inhibit  what  would  otherwise  be  the 
boundless  and  intrinsic  creativity  of  our  children,  even  though  the  scientific 
literature  clearly  indicates,  first,  that  creativity  beyond  the  trivial  is  shockingly 
rare  and,  second,  that  strict  limitations  facilitate  rather  than  inhibit  creative 
achievement.  Belief  in  the  purely  destructive  element  of  rules  and  structure  is 
frequently  conjoined  with  the  idea  that  children  will  make  good  choices  about 
when  to  sleep  and  what  to  eat,  if  their  perfect  natures  are  merely  allowed  to 
manifest  themselves.  These  are  equally  ungrounded  assumptions.  Children  are 
perfectly  capable  of  attempting  to  subsist  on  hot  dogs,  chicken  fingers  and  Froot 
Loops  if  doing  so  will  attract  attention,  provide  power,  or  shield  them  from 
trying  anything  new.  Instead  of  going  to  bed  wisely  and  peacefully,  children  will 
fight  night-time  unconsciousness  until  they  are  staggered  by  fatigue.  They  are 
also  perfectly  willing  to  provoke  adults,  while  exploring  the  complex  contours  of 
the  social  environment,  just  like  juvenile  chimps  harassing  the  adults  in  their 
troupes.  Observing  the  consequences  of  teasing  and  taunting  enables  chimp 
and  child  alike  to  discover  the  limits  of  what  might  otherwise  be  a  too- 
unstructured  and  terrifying  freedom.  Such  limits,  when  discovered,  provide 
security,  even  if  their  detection  causes  momentary  disappointment  or  frustration. 

I  remember  taking  my  daughter  to  the  playground  once  when  she  was  about 
two.  She  was  playing  on  the  monkey  bars,  hanging  in  mid-air.  A  particularly 
provocative  little  monster  of  about  the  same  age  was  standing  above  her  on  the 
same  bar  she  was  gripping.  I  watched  him  move  towards  her.  Our  eyes  locked. 
He  slowly  and  deliberately  stepped  on  her  hands,  with  increasing  force,  over  and 
over,  as  he  stared  me  down.  He  knew  exactly  what  he  was  doing.  Up  yours, 
Daddy-O — that  was  his  philosophy.  He  had  already  concluded  that  adults  were 
contemptible,  and  that  he  could  safely  defy  them.  (Too  bad,  then,  that  he  was 
destined  to  become  one.)  That  was  the  hopeless  future  his  parents  had  saddled 
him  with.  To  his  great  and  salutary  shock,  I  picked  him  bodily  off  the 
playground  structure,  and  threw  him  thirty  feet  down  the  field. 

No,  I  didn’t.  I  just  took  my  daughter  somewhere  else.  But  it  would  have  been 
better  for  him  if  I  had. 

Imagine  a  toddler  repeatedly  striking  his  mother  in  the  face.  Why  would  he  do 
such  a  thing?  It’s  a  stupid  question.  It’s  unacceptably  naive.  The  answer  is 
obvious.  To  dominate  his  mother.  To  see  if  he  can  get  away  with  it.  Violence, 
after  all,  is  no  mystery.  It’s  peace  that’s  the  mystery.  Violence  is  the  default.  It’s 
easy.  It’s  peace  that  is  difficult:  learned,  inculcated,  earned.  (People  often  get 
basic  psychological  questions  backwards.  Why  do  people  take  drugs?  Not  a 
mystery.  It’s  why  they  don’t  take  them  all  the  time  that’s  the  mystery.  Why  do 


people  suffer  from  anxiety?  That’s  not  a  mystery.  How  is  that  people  can  ever  be 
calm?  There’s  the  mystery.  We’re  breakable  and  mortal.  A  million  things  can  go 
wrong,  in  a  million  ways.  We  should  be  terrified  out  of  our  skulls  at  every 
second.  But  we’re  not.  The  same  can  be  said  for  depression,  laziness  and 
criminality.) 

If  I  can  hurt  and  overpower  you,  then  I  can  do  exactly  what  I  want,  when  I 
want,  even  when  you’re  around.  I  can  torment  you,  to  appease  my  curiosity.  I 
can  take  the  attention  away  from  you,  and  dominate  you.  I  can  steal  your  toy. 
Children  hit  first  because  aggression  is  innate,  although  more  dominant  in  some 
individuals  and  less  in  others,  and,  second,  because  aggression  facilitates  desire. 
It’s  foolish  to  assume  that  such  behaviour  must  be  learned.  A  snake  does  not 
have  to  be  taught  to  strike.  It’s  in  the  nature  of  the  beast.  Two-year-olds, 
statistically  speaking,  are  the  most  violent  of  people.  They  kick,  hit  and  bite, 
and  they  steal  the  property  of  others.  They  do  so  to  explore,  to  express  outrage 
and  frustration,  and  to  gratify  their  impulsive  desires.  More  importantly,  for  our 
purposes,  they  do  so  to  discover  the  true  limits  of  permissible  behaviour.  How 
else  are  they  ever  going  to  puzzle  out  what  is  acceptable?  Infants  are  like  blind 
people,  searching  for  a  wall.  They  have  to  push  forward,  and  test,  to  see  where 
the  actual  boundaries  lie  (and  those  are  too-seldom  where  they  are  said  to  be). 

Consistent  correction  of  such  action  indicates  the  limits  of  acceptable 
aggression  to  the  child.  Its  absence  merely  heightens  curiosity — so  the  child  will 
hit  and  bite  and  kick,  if  he  is  aggressive  and  dominant,  until  something  indicates 
a  limit.  How  hard  can  I  hit  Mommy?  Until  she  objects.  Given  that,  correction  is 
better  sooner  than  later  (if  the  desired  end  result  of  the  parent  is  not  to  be  hit). 
Correction  also  helps  the  child  learn  that  hitting  others  is  a  sub-optimal  social 
strategy.  Without  that  correction,  no  child  is  going  to  undergo  the  effortful 
process  of  organizing  and  regulating  their  impulses,  so  that  those  impulses  can 
coexist,  without  conflict,  within  the  psyche  of  the  child,  and  in  the  broader  social 
world.  It  is  no  simple  matter  to  organize  a  mind. 

My  son  was  particularly  ornery  when  he  was  a  toddler.  When  my  daughter 
was  little,  I  could  paralyze  her  into  immobility  with  an  evil  glance.  Such  an 
intervention  had  no  effect  at  all  on  my  son.  He  had  my  wife  (who  is  no 
pushover)  stymied  at  the  dinner  table  by  the  time  he  was  nine  months  of  age.  He 
fought  her  for  control  over  the  spoon.  “Good!”  we  thought.  We  didn’t  want  to 
feed  him  one  more  minute  than  necessary  anyway.  But  the  little  blighter  would 
only  eat  three  or  four  mouthfuls.  Then  he  would  play.  He  would  stir  his  food 
around  in  his  bowl.  He  would  drop  bits  of  it  over  the  high  chair  table  top,  and 
watch  as  it  fell  on  the  floor  below.  No  problem.  He  was  exploring.  But  then  he 
wasn’t  eating  enough.  Then,  because  he  wasn’t  eating  enough,  he  wasn’t 


sleeping  enough.  Then  his  midnight  crying  was  waking  his  parents.  Then  they 
were  getting  grumpy  and  out  of  sorts.  He  was  frustrating  his  mother,  and  she  was 
taking  it  out  on  me.  The  trajectory  wasn’t  good. 

After  a  few  days  of  this  degeneration,  I  decided  to  take  the  spoon  back.  I 
prepared  for  war.  I  set  aside  sufficient  time.  A  patient  adult  can  defeat  a  two- 
year-old,  hard  as  that  is  to  believe.  As  the  saying  goes:  “Old  age  and  treachery 
can  always  overcome  youth  and  skill.”  This  is  partly  because  time  lasts  forever, 
when  you’re  two.  Half  an  hour  for  me  was  a  week  for  my  son.  I  assured  myself 
of  victory.  He  was  stubborn  and  horrible.  But  I  could  be  worse.  We  sat  down, 
face  to  face,  bowl  in  front  of  him.  It  was  High  Noon.  He  knew  it,  and  I  knew  it. 
He  picked  up  the  spoon.  I  took  it  from  him,  and  spooned  up  a  delicious  mouthful 
of  mush.  I  moved  it  deliberately  towards  his  mouth.  He  eyed  me  in  precisely  the 
same  manner  as  the  playground  foot  monster.  He  curled  his  lips  downward  into  a 
tight  frown,  rejecting  all  entry.  I  chased  his  mouth  around  with  the  spoon  as  he 
twisted  his  head  around  in  tight  circles. 

But  I  had  more  tricks  up  my  sleeve.  I  poked  him  in  the  chest,  with  my  free 
hand,  in  a  manner  calculated  to  annoy.  He  didn’t  budge.  I  did  it  again.  And 
again.  And  again.  Not  hard — but  not  in  a  manner  to  be  ignored,  either.  Ten  or  so 
pokes  letter,  he  opened  his  mouth,  planning  to  emit  a  sound  of  outrage.  Hah!  His 
mistake.  I  deftly  inserted  the  spoon.  He  tried,  gamely,  to  force  out  the  offending 
food  with  his  tongue.  But  I  know  how  to  deal  with  that,  too.  I  just  placed  my 
forefinger  horizontally  across  his  lips.  Some  came  out.  But  some  was  swallowed, 
too.  Score  one  for  Dad.  I  gave  him  a  pat  on  the  head,  and  told  him  that  he  was  a 
good  boy.  And  I  meant  it.  When  someone  does  something  you  are  trying  to  get 
them  to  do,  reward  them.  No  grudge  after  victory.  An  hour  later,  it  was  all  over. 
There  was  outrage.  There  was  some  wailing.  My  wife  had  to  leave  the  room. 

The  stress  was  too  much.  But  food  was  eaten  by  child.  My  son  collapsed, 
exhausted,  on  my  chest.  We  had  a  nap  together.  And  he  liked  me  a  lot  better 
when  he  woke  up  than  he  had  before  he  was  disciplined. 

This  was  something  I  commonly  observed  when  we  went  head  to  head — and 
not  only  with  him.  A  little  later  we  entered  into  a  babysitting  swap  with  another 
couple.  All  the  kids  would  get  together  at  one  house.  Then  one  pair  of  parents 
would  go  out  to  dinner,  or  a  movie,  and  leave  the  other  pair  to  watch  the 
children,  who  were  all  under  three.  One  evening,  another  set  of  parents  joined 
us.  I  was  unfamiliar  with  their  son,  a  large,  strong  boy  of  two. 

“He  won’t  sleep,”  said  his  father.  “After  you  put  him  to  bed,  he  will  crawl  out 
of  his  bed,  and  come  downstairs.  We  usually  put  on  an  Elmo  video  and  let  him 
watch  it.” 


“There’s  no  damn  way  I’m  rewarding  a  recalcitrant  child  for  unacceptable 
behaviour,”  I  thought,  “and  I’m  certainly  not  showing  anyone  any  Elmo  video.” 

I  always  hated  that  creepy,  whiny  puppet.  He  was  a  disgrace  to  Jim  Henson’s 
legacy.  So  reward-by-Elmo  was  not  on  the  table.  I  didn’t  say  anything,  of  course. 
There  is  just  no  talking  to  parents  about  their  children — until  they  are  ready  to 
listen. 

Two  hours  later,  we  put  the  kids  to  bed.  Four  of  the  five  went  promptly  to 
sleep — but  not  the  Muppet  aficionado.  I  had  placed  him  in  a  crib,  however,  so  he 
couldn’t  escape.  But  he  could  still  howl,  and  that’s  exactly  what  he  did.  That  was 
tricky.  It  was  good  strategy  on  his  part.  It  was  annoying,  and  it  threatened  to 
wake  up  all  the  other  kids,  who  would  then  also  start  to  howl.  Score  one  for  the 
kid.  So,  I  journeyed  into  the  bedroom.  “Lie  down,”  I  said.  That  produced  no 
effect.  “Lie  down,”  I  said,  “or  I  will  lay  you  down.”  Reasoning  with  kids  isn’t 
often  of  too  much  use,  particularly  under  such  circumstances,  but  I  believe  in 
fair  warning.  Of  course,  he  didn’t  lie  down.  He  howled  again,  for  effect. 

Kids  do  this  frequently.  Scared  parents  think  that  a  crying  child  is  always  sad 
or  hurt.  This  is  simply  not  true.  Anger  is  one  of  the  most  common  reasons  for 
crying.  Careful  analysis  of  the  musculature  patterns  of  crying  children  has 
confirmed  this.  Anger-crying  and  fear-or-sadness  crying  do  not  look  the  same. 
They  also  don’t  sound  the  same,  and  can  be  distinguished  with  careful  attention. 
Anger-crying  is  often  an  act  of  dominance,  and  should  be  dealt  with  as  such.  I 
lifted  him  up,  and  laid  him  down.  Gently.  Patiently.  But  firmly.  He  got  up.  I  laid 
him  down.  He  got  up.  I  laid  him  down.  He  got  up.  This  time,  I  laid  him  down, 
and  kept  my  hand  on  his  back.  He  struggled,  mightily,  but  ineffectually.  He  was, 
after  all,  only  one-tenth  my  size.  I  could  take  him  with  one  hand.  So,  I  kept  him 
down  and  spoke  calmly  to  him  and  told  him  he  was  a  good  boy  and  that  he 
should  relax.  I  gave  him  a  soother  and  pounded  gently  on  his  back.  He  started  to 
relax.  His  eyes  began  to  close.  I  removed  my  hand. 

He  promptly  got  to  his  feet.  I  was  impressed.  The  kid  had  spirit!  I  lifted  him 
up,  and  laid  him  down,  again.  “Lie  down,  monster,”  I  said.  I  pounded  his  back 
gently  some  more.  Some  kids  find  that  soothing.  He  was  getting  tired.  He  was 
ready  to  capitulate.  He  closed  his  eyes.  I  got  to  my  feet,  and  headed  quietly  and 
quickly  to  the  door.  I  glanced  back,  to  check  his  position,  one  last  time.  He  was 
back  on  his  feet.  I  pointed  my  finger  at  him.  “Down,  monster,”  I  said,  and  I 
meant  it.  He  went  down  like  a  shot.  I  closed  the  door.  We  liked  each  other. 
Neither  my  wife  nor  I  heard  a  peep  out  of  him  for  the  rest  of  the  night. 

“How  was  the  kid?”  his  father  asked  me  when  he  got  home,  much  later  that 
night.  “Good,”  I  said.  “No  problem  at  all.  He’s  asleep  right  now.” 

“Did  he  get  up?”  said  his  father. 


“No,”  I  said.  “He  slept  the  whole  time.” 

Dad  looked  at  me.  He  wanted  to  know.  But  he  didn’t  ask.  And  I  didn’t  tell. 

Don’t  cast  pearls  before  swine,  as  the  old  saying  goes.  And  you  might  think 
that’s  harsh.  But  training  your  child  not  to  sleep,  and  rewarding  him  with  the 
antics  of  a  creepy  puppet?  That’s  harsh  too.  You  pick  your  poison,  and  I’ll  pick 
mine. 

Discipline  and  Punish 

Modern  parents  are  terrified  of  two  frequently  juxtaposed  words:  discipline  and 
punish.  They  evoke  images  of  prisons,  soldiers  and  jackboots.  The  distance 
between  disciplinarian  and  tyrant  or  punishment  and  torture  is,  indeed,  easily 
traversed.  Discipline  and  punish  must  be  handled  with  care.  The  fear  is 
unsurprising.  But  both  are  necessary.  They  can  be  applied  unconsciously  or 
consciously,  badly  or  well,  but  there  is  no  escaping  their  use. 

It’s  not  that  it’s  impossible  to  discipline  with  reward.  In  fact,  rewarding  good 
behaviour  can  be  very  effective.  The  most  famous  of  all  behavioural 
psychologists,  B.F.  Skinner,  was  a  great  advocate  of  this  approach.  He  was 
expert  at  it.  He  taught  pigeons  to  play  ping-pong,  although  they  only  rolled  the 
ball  back  and  forth  by  pecking  it  with  their  beaks.  But  they  were  pigeons.  So 
even  though  they  played  badly,  it  was  still  pretty  good.  Skinner  even  taught  his 
birds  to  pilot  missiles  during  the  Second  World  War,  in  Project  Pigeon  (later 
Orcon).  He  got  a  long  way,  before  the  invention  of  electronic  guidance 
systems  rendered  his  efforts  obsolete. 

Skinner  observed  the  animals  he  was  training  to  perform  such  acts  with 
exceptional  care.  Any  actions  that  approximated  what  he  was  aiming  at  were 
immediately  followed  by  a  reward  of  just  the  right  size:  not  small  enough  to  be 
inconsequential,  and  not  so  large  that  it  devalued  future  rewards.  Such  an 
approach  can  be  used  with  children,  and  works  very  well.  Imagine  that  you 
would  like  your  toddler  to  help  set  the  table.  It’s  a  useful  skill.  You’d  like  him 
better  if  he  could  do  it.  It  would  be  good  for  his  (shudder)  self-esteem.  So,  you 
break  the  target  behaviour  down  into  its  component  parts.  One  element  of  setting 
the  table  is  carrying  a  plate  from  the  cupboard  to  the  table.  Even  that  might  be 
too  complex.  Perhaps  your  child  has  only  been  walking  a  few  months.  He’s  still 
wobbly  and  unreliable.  So,  you  start  his  training  by  handing  him  a  plate  and 
having  him  hand  it  back.  A  pat  on  the  head  could  follow.  You  might  turn  it  into  a 
game.  Pass  with  your  left.  Switch  to  your  right.  Circle  around  your  back.  Then 
you  might  give  him  a  plate  and  take  a  few  steps  backward  so  that  he  has  to 


traverse  a  few  steps  before  giving  it  back.  Train  him  to  become  a  plate-handling 
virtuoso.  Don’t  leave  him  trapped  in  his  klutz-dom. 

You  can  teach  virtually  anyone  anything  with  such  an  approach.  First,  figure 
out  what  you  want.  Then,  watch  the  people  around  you  like  a  hawk.  Finally, 
whenever  you  see  anything  a  bit  more  like  what  you  want,  swoop  in  (hawk, 
remember)  and  deliver  a  reward.  Your  daughter  has  been  very  reserved  since  she 
became  a  teenager.  You  wish  she  would  talk  more.  That’s  the  target:  more 
communicative  daughter.  One  morning,  over  breakfast,  she  shares  an  anecdote 
about  school.  That’s  an  excellent  time  to  pay  attention.  That’s  the  reward.  Stop 
texting  and  listen.  Unless  you  don’t  want  her  to  tell  you  anything  ever  again. 

Parental  interventions  that  make  children  happy  clearly  can  and  should  be 
used  to  shape  behaviour.  The  same  goes  for  husbands,  wives,  co-workers  and 
parents.  Skinner,  however,  was  a  realist.  He  noted  that  use  of  reward  was  very 
difficult:  the  observer  had  to  attend  patiently  until  the  target  spontaneously 
manifested  the  desired  behaviour,  and  then  reinforce.  This  required  a  lot  of  time, 
and  a  lot  of  waiting,  and  that’s  a  problem.  He  also  had  to  starve  his  animals 
down  to  three-quarters  of  their  normal  body  weight  before  they  would  become 
interested  enough  in  food  reward  to  truly  pay  attention.  But  these  are  not  the 
only  shortcomings  of  the  purely  positive  approach. 

Negative  emotions,  like  their  positive  counterparts,  help  us  learn.  We  need  to 
learn,  because  we’re  stupid  and  easily  damaged.  We  can  die.  That’s  not  good, 
and  we  don’t  feel  good  about  it.  If  we  did,  we  would  seek  death,  and  then  we 
would  die.  We  don’t  even  feel  good  about  dying  if  it  only  might  happen.  And 
that’s  all  the  time.  In  that  manner,  negative  emotions,  for  all  their  unpleasantness, 
protect  us.  We  feel  hurt  and  scared  and  ashamed  and  disgusted  so  we  can  avoid 
damage.  And  we’re  susceptible  to  feeling  such  things  a  lot.  In  fact,  we  feel  more 
negative  about  a  loss  of  a  given  size  than  we  feel  good  about  the  same-sized 
gain.  Pain  is  more  potent  than  pleasure,  and  anxiety  more  than  hope. 

Emotions,  positive  and  negative,  come  in  two  usefully  differentiated  variants. 
Satisfaction  (technically,  satiation)  tells  us  that  what  we  did  was  good,  while 
hope  (technically,  incentive  reward)  indicates  that  something  pleasurable  is  on 
the  way.  Pain  hurts  us,  so  we  won’t  repeat  actions  that  produced  personal 
damage  or  social  isolation  (as  loneliness  is  also,  technically,  a  form  of  pain). 
Anxiety  makes  us  stay  away  from  hurtful  people  and  bad  places  so  we  don’t 
have  to  feel  pain.  A11  these  emotions  must  be  balanced  against  each  other,  and 
carefully  judged  in  context,  but  they’re  all  required  to  keep  us  alive  and  thriving. 
We  therefore  do  our  children  a  disservice  by  failing  to  use  whatever  is  available 
to  help  them  learn,  including  negative  emotions,  even  though  such  use  should 
occur  in  the  most  merciful  possible  manner. 


Skinner  knew  that  threats  and  punishments  could  stop  unwanted  behaviours, 
just  as  reward  reinforces  what  is  desirable.  In  a  world  paralyzed  at  the  thought  of 
interfering  with  the  hypothetically  pristine  path  of  natural  child  development,  it 
can  be  difficult  even  to  discuss  the  former  techniques.  However,  children  would 
not  have  such  a  lengthy  period  of  natural  development,  prior  to  maturity,  if  their 
behaviour  did  not  have  to  be  shaped.  They  would  just  leap  out  of  the  womb, 
ready  to  trade  stocks.  Children  also  cannot  be  fully  sheltered  from  fear  and  pain. 
They  are  small  and  vulnerable.  They  don’t  know  much  about  the  world.  Even 
when  they  are  doing  something  as  natural  as  learning  to  walk,  they’re  constantly 
being  walloped  by  the  world.  And  this  is  to  say  nothing  of  the  frustration  and 
rejection  they  inevitably  experience  when  dealing  with  siblings  and  peers  and 
uncooperative,  stubborn  adults.  Given  this,  the  fundamental  moral  question  is 
not  how  to  shelter  children  completely  from  misadventure  and  failure,  so  they 
never  experience  any  fear  or  pain,  but  how  to  maximize  their  learning  so  that 
useful  knowledge  may  be  gained  with  minimal  cost. 

In  the  Disney  movie  Sleeping  Beauty,  the  King  and  Queen  have  a  daughter, 
the  princess  Aurora,  after  a  long  wait.  They  plan  a  great  christening,  to  introduce 
her  to  the  world.  They  welcome  everyone  who  loves  and  honours  their  new 
daughter.  But  they  fail  to  invite  Maleficent  (malicious,  malevolent),  who  is 
essentially  Queen  of  the  Underworld,  or  Nature  in  her  negative  guise.  This 
means,  symbolically,  that  the  two  monarchs  are  overprotecting  their  beloved 
daughter,  by  setting  up  a  world  around  her  that  has  nothing  negative  in  it.  But 
this  does  not  protect  her.  It  makes  her  weak.  Maleficent  curses  the  princess, 
sentencing  her  to  death  at  the  age  of  sixteen,  caused  by  the  prick  of  a  spinning 
wheel’s  needle.  The  spinning  wheel  is  the  wheel  of  fate;  the  prick,  which 
produces  blood,  symbolizes  the  loss  of  virginity,  a  sign  of  the  emergence  of  the 
woman  from  the  child. 

Fortunately,  a  good  fairy  (the  positive  element  of  Nature)  reduces  the 
punishment  to  unconsciousness,  redeemable  with  love’s  first  kiss.  The  panicked 
King  and  Queen  get  rid  of  all  the  spinning  wheels  in  the  land,  and  turn  their 
daughter  over  to  the  much-too-nice  good  fairies,  of  whom  there  are  three.  They 
continue  with  their  strategy  of  removing  all  dangerous  things — but  in  doing  so 
they  leave  their  daughter  naive,  immature  and  weak.  One  day,  just  before 
Aurora’s  sixteenth  birthday,  she  meets  a  prince  in  the  forest,  and  falls  in  love,  the 
same  day.  By  any  reasonable  standard,  that’s  a  bit  much.  Then  she  loudly 
bemoans  the  fact  that  she  is  to  be  wed  to  Prince  Philip,  to  whom  she  was 
betrothed  as  a  child,  and  collapses  emotionally  when  she  is  brought  back  to  her 
parents’  castle  for  her  birthday.  It  is  at  that  moment  that  Maleficent’s  curse 
manifests  itself.  A  portal  opens  up  in  the  castle,  a  spinning  wheel  appears,  and 


Aurora  pricks  her  finger  and  falls  unconscious.  She  becomes  Sleeping  Beauty.  In 
doing  so  (again,  symbolically  speaking)  she  chooses  unconsciousness  over  the 
terror  of  adult  life.  Something  existentially  similar  to  this  often  occurs  very 
frequently  with  overprotected  children,  who  can  be  brought  low — and  then 
desire  the  bliss  of  unconsciousness — by  their  first  real  contact  with  failure  or, 
worse,  genuine  malevolence,  which  they  do  not  or  will  not  understand  and 
against  which  they  have  no  defence. 

Take  the  case  of  the  three-year-old  who  has  not  learned  to  share.  She  displays 
her  selfish  behaviour  in  the  presence  of  her  parents,  but  they’re  too  nice  to 
intervene.  More  truthfully,  they  refuse  to  pay  attention,  admit  to  what  is 
happening,  and  teach  her  how  to  act  properly.  They’re  annoyed,  of  course,  when 
she  won’t  share  with  her  sister,  but  they  pretend  everything  is  OK.  It’s  not  OK. 
They’ll  snap  at  her  later,  for  something  totally  unrelated.  She  will  be  hurt  by  that, 
and  confused,  but  learn  nothing.  Worse:  when  she  tries  to  make  friends,  it  won’t 
go  well,  because  of  her  lack  of  social  sophistication.  Children  her  own  age  will 
be  put  off  by  her  inability  to  cooperate.  They’ll  fight  with  her,  or  wander  off  and 
find  someone  else  to  play  with.  The  parents  of  those  children  will  observe  her 
awkwardness  and  misbehaviour,  and  won’t  invite  her  back  to  play  with  their 
kids.  She  will  be  lonely  and  rejected.  That  will  produce  anxiety,  depression  and 
resentment.  That  will  produce  the  turning  from  life  that  is  equivalent  to  the  wish 
for  unconsciousness. 

Parents  who  refuse  to  adopt  the  responsibility  for  disciplining  their  children 
think  they  can  just  opt  out  of  the  conflict  necessary  for  proper  child-rearing. 

They  avoid  being  the  bad  guy  (in  the  short  term).  But  they  do  not  at  all  rescue  or 
protect  their  children  from  fear  and  pain.  Quite  the  contrary:  the  judgmental  and 
uncaring  broader  social  world  will  mete  out  conflict  and  punishment  far  greater 
than  that  which  would  have  been  delivered  by  an  awake  parent.  You  can 
discipline  your  children,  or  you  can  turn  that  responsibility  over  to  the  harsh, 
uncaring  judgmental  world — and  the  motivation  for  the  latter  decision  should 
never  be  confused  with  love. 

You  might  object,  as  modern  parents  sometimes  do:  why  should  a  child  even 
be  subject  to  the  arbitrary  dictates  of  a  parent?  In  fact,  there  is  a  new  variant  of 
politically  correct  thinking  that  presumes  that  such  an  idea  is  “adultism:”  a 
form  of  prejudice  and  oppression  analogous  to,  say,  sexism  or  racism.  The 
question  of  adult  authority  must  be  answered  with  care.  That  requires  a  thorough 
examination  of  the  question  itself.  Accepting  an  objection  as  formulated  is 
halfway  to  accepting  its  validity,  and  that  can  be  dangerous  if  the  question  is  ill- 
posed.  Let’s  break  it  down. 

First,  why  should  a  child  be  subject ?  That’s  easy.  Every  child  must  listen  to 


and  obey  adults  because  he  or  she  is  dependent  on  the  care  that  one  or  more 
imperfect  grown-ups  is  willing  to  bestow.  Given  this,  it  is  better  for  the  child  to 
act  in  a  manner  that  invites  genuine  affection  and  goodwill.  Something  even 
better  might  be  imagined.  The  child  could  act  in  a  manner  that  simultaneously 
ensures  optimal  adult  attention,  in  a  manner  that  benefits  his  or  her  present  state 
of  being  and  future  development.  That’s  a  very  high  standard,  but  it’s  in  the  best 
interests  of  the  child,  so  there  is  every  reason  to  aspire  to  it. 

Every  child  should  also  be  taught  to  comply  gracefully  with  the  expectations 
of  civil  society.  This  does  not  mean  crushed  into  mindless  ideological 
conformity.  It  means  instead  that  parents  must  reward  those  attitudes  and  actions 
that  will  bring  their  child  success  in  the  world  outside  the  family,  and  use  threat 
and  punishment  when  necessary  to  eliminate  behaviours  that  will  lead  to  misery 
and  failure.  There’s  a  tight  window  of  opportunity  for  this,  as  well,  so  getting  it 
right  quickly  matters.  If  a  child  has  not  been  taught  to  behave  properly  by  the 
age  of  four,  it  will  forever  be  difficult  for  him  or  her  to  make  friends.  The 
research  literature  is  quite  clear  on  this.  This  matters,  because  peers  are  the 
primary  source  of  socialization  after  the  age  of  four.  Rejected  children  cease  to 
develop,  because  they  are  alienated  from  their  peers.  They  fall  further  and 
further  behind,  as  the  other  children  continue  to  progress.  Thus,  the  friendless 
child  too  often  becomes  the  lonely,  antisocial  or  depressed  teenager  and  adult. 
This  is  not  good.  Much  more  of  our  sanity  than  we  commonly  realize  is  a 
consequence  of  our  fortunate  immersion  in  a  social  community.  We  must  be 
continually  reminded  to  think  and  act  properly.  When  we  drift,  people  that  care 
for  and  love  us  nudge  us  in  small  ways  and  large  back  on  track.  So,  we  better 
have  some  of  those  people  around. 

It’s  also  not  the  case  (back  to  the  question)  that  adult  dictates  are  all  arbitrary. 
That’s  only  true  in  a  dysfunctional  totalitarian  state.  But  in  civilized,  open 
societies,  the  majority  abide  by  a  functional  social  contract,  aimed  at  mutual 
betterment — or  at  least  at  existence  in  close  proximity  without  too  much 
violence.  Even  a  system  of  rules  that  allows  for  only  that  minimum  contract  is 
by  no  means  arbitrary,  given  the  alternatives.  If  a  society  does  not  adequately 
reward  productive,  pro-social  behavior,  insists  upon  distributing  resources  in  a 
markedly  arbitrary  and  unfair  manner,  and  allows  for  theft  and  exploitation,  it 
will  not  remain  conflict-free  for  long.  If  its  hierarchies  are  based  only  (or  even 
primarily)  on  power,  instead  of  the  competence  necessary  to  get  important  and 
difficult  things  done,  it  will  be  prone  to  collapse,  as  well.  This  is  even  true,  in 
simpler  form,  of  the  hierarchies  of  chimpanzees,  which  is  an  indication  of  its 
fundamental,  biological  and  non-arbitrary  emergent  truth. 

Poorly  socialized  children  have  terrible  lives.  Thus,  it  is  better  to  socialize 


them  optimally.  Some  of  this  can  be  done  with  reward,  but  not  all  of  it.  The  issue 
is  therefore  not  whether  to  use  punishment  and  threat.  The  issue  is  whether  to  do 
it  consciously  and  thoughtfully.  How,  then,  should  children  be  disciplined?  This 
is  a  very  difficult  question,  because  children  (and  parents)  differ  vastly  in  their 
temperaments.  Some  children  are  agreeable.  They  deeply  want  to  please,  but  pay 
for  that  with  a  tendency  to  be  conflict-averse  and  dependent.  Others  are  tougher- 
minded  and  more  independent.  Those  kids  want  to  do  what  they  want,  when  they 
want,  all  the  time.  They  can  be  challenging,  non-compliant  and  stubborn.  Some 
children  are  desperate  for  rules  and  structure,  and  are  content  even  in  rigid 
environments.  Others,  with  little  regard  for  predictability  and  routine,  are 
immune  to  demands  for  even  minimal  necessary  order.  Some  are  wildly 
imaginative  and  creative,  and  others  more  concrete  and  conservative.  These  are 
all  deep,  important  differences,  heavily  influenced  by  biological  factors  and 
difficult  to  modify  socially.  It  is  fortunate  indeed  that  in  the  face  of  such 
variability  we  are  the  beneficiaries  of  much  thoughtful  meditation  on  the  proper 
use  of  social  control. 

Minimum  Necessary  Force 

Here’s  a  straightforward  initial  idea:  rules  should  not  be  multiplied  beyond 
necessity.  Alternatively  stated,  bad  laws  drive  out  respect  for  good  laws.  This  is 
the  ethical — even  legal — equivalent  of  Occam’s  razor,  the  scientist’s  conceptual 
guillotine,  which  states  that  the  simplest  possible  hypothesis  is  preferable.  So, 
don’t  encumber  children — or  their  disciplinarians — with  too  many  rules.  That 
path  leads  to  frustration. 

Limit  the  rules.  Then,  figure  out  what  to  do  when  one  of  them  gets  broken.  A 
general,  context-independent  rule  for  punishment  severity  is  hard  to  establish. 
However,  a  helpful  norm  has  already  been  enshrined  in  English  common  law, 
one  of  the  great  products  of  Western  civilization.  Its  analysis  can  help  us 
establish  a  second  useful  principle. 

English  common  law  allows  you  to  defend  your  rights,  but  only  in  a 
reasonable  manner.  Someone  breaks  into  your  house.  You  have  a  loaded  pistol. 
You  have  a  right  to  defend  yourself,  but  it’s  better  to  do  it  in  stages.  What  if  it’s  a 
dmnk  and  confused  neighbour?  “Shoot  'em!”  you  think.  But  it’s  not  that  simple. 
So,  you  say,  instead,  “Stop!  I  have  a  gun.”  If  that  produces  neither  explanation 
nor  retreat,  you  might  consider  a  warning  shot.  Then,  if  the  perpetrator  still 
advances,  you  might  take  aim  at  his  leg.  (Don’t  mistake  any  of  this  for  legal 
advice.  It’s  an  example.)  A  single  brilliantly  practical  principle  can  be  used  to 
generate  all  these  incrementally  more  severe  reactions:  that  of  minimum 


necessary  force.  So  now  we  have  two  general  principles  of  discipline.  The  first: 
limit  the  rules.  The  second:  Use  the  least  force  necessary  to  enforce  those  rules. 

About  the  first  principle,  you  might  ask,  “Limit  the  rules  to  what,  exactly?” 
Here  are  some  suggestions.  Do  not  bite,  kick  or  hit,  except  in  self-defence.  Do 
not  torture  and  bully  other  children,  so  you  don’t  end  up  in  jail.  Eat  in  a  civilized 
and  thankful  manner,  so  that  people  are  happy  to  have  you  at  their  house,  and 
pleased  to  feed  you.  Learn  to  share,  so  other  kids  will  play  with  you.  Pay 
attention  when  spoken  to  by  adults,  so  they  don’t  hate  you  and  might  therefore 
deign  to  teach  you  something.  Go  to  sleep  properly,  and  peaceably,  so  that  your 
parents  can  have  a  private  life  and  not  resent  your  existence.  Take  care  of  your 
belongings,  because  you  need  to  learn  how  and  because  you’re  lucky  to  have 
them.  Be  good  company  when  something  fun  is  happening,  so  that  you’re 
invited  for  the  fun.  Act  so  that  other  people  are  happy  you’re  around,  so  that 
people  will  want  you  around.  A  child  who  knows  these  rules  will  be  welcome 
everywhere. 

About  the  second,  equally  important  principle,  your  question  might  be:  What 
is  minimum  necessary  force?  This  must  be  established  experimentally,  starting 
with  the  smallest  possible  intervention.  Some  children  will  be  turned  to  stone  by 
a  glare.  A  verbal  command  will  stop  another.  A  thumb-cocked  flick  of  the  index 
finger  on  a  small  hand  might  be  necessary  for  some.  Such  a  strategy  is 
particularly  useful  in  public  places  such  as  restaurants.  It  can  be  administered 
suddenly,  quietly  and  effectively,  without  risking  escalation.  What’s  the 
alternative?  A  child  who  is  crying  angrily,  demanding  attention,  is  not  making 
himself  popular.  A  child  who  is  running  from  table  to  table  and  disrupting 
everyone’s  peace  is  bringing  disgrace  (an  old  word,  but  a  good  one)  on  himself 
and  his  parents.  Such  outcomes  are  far  from  optimal,  and  children  will  definitely 
misbehave  more  in  public,  because  they  are  experimenting:  trying  to  establish  if 
the  same  old  rules  also  apply  in  the  new  place.  They  don’t  sort  that  out  verbally, 
not  when  they  are  under  three. 

When  our  children  were  little  and  we  took  them  to  restaurants,  they  attracted 
smiles.  They  sat  nicely  and  ate  politely.  They  couldn’t  keep  it  up  for  long,  but  we 
didn’t  keep  them  there  too  long.  When  they  started  to  get  antsy,  after  sitting  for 
forty-five  minutes,  we  knew  it  was  time  to  go.  That  was  part  of  the  deal.  Nearby 
diners  would  tell  us  how  nice  it  was  to  see  a  happy  family.  We  weren’t  always 
happy,  and  our  children  weren’t  always  properly  behaved.  But  they  were  most  of 
the  time,  and  it  was  wonderful  to  see  people  responding  so  positively  to  their 
presence.  It  was  truly  good  for  the  kids.  They  could  see  that  people  liked  them. 
This  also  reinforced  their  good  behaviour.  That  was  the  reward. 


People  will  really  like  your  kids  if  you  give  them  the  chance.  This  is 
something  I  learned  as  soon  as  we  had  our  first  baby,  our  daughter,  Mikhaila. 
When  we  took  her  down  the  street  in  her  little  foldup  stroller  in  our  French 
Montreal  working-class  neighbourhood,  rough-looking  heavy-drinking 
lumberjack  types  would  stop  in  their  tracks  and  smile  at  her.  They  would  coo 
and  giggle  and  make  stupid  faces.  Watching  people  respond  to  children  restores 
your  faith  in  human  nature.  All  that’s  multiplied  when  your  kids  behave  in 
public.  To  ensure  that  such  things  happen,  you  have  to  discipline  your  children 
carefully  and  effectively — and  to  do  that,  you  have  to  know  something  about 
reward,  and  about  punishment,  instead  of  shying  away  from  the  knowledge. 

Part  of  establishing  a  relationship  with  your  son  or  daughter  is  learning  how 
that  small  person  responds  to  disciplinary  intervention — and  then  intervening 
effectively.  It’s  very  easy  to  mouth  cliches  instead,  such  as:  “There  is  no  excuse 
for  physical  punishment,”  or,  “Hitting  children  merely  teaches  them  to  hit.”  Let’s 
start  with  the  former  claim:  there  is  no  excuse  for  physical  punishment.  First,  we 
should  note  the  widespread  consensus  around  the  idea  that  some  forms  of 
misbehavior,  particularly  those  associated  with  theft  and  assault,  are  both  wrong 
and  should  be  subject  to  sanction.  Second,  we  should  note  that  almost  all  those 
sanctions  involve  punishment  in  its  many  psychological  and  more  directly 
physical  forms.  Deprivation  of  liberty  causes  pain  in  a  manner  essentially  similar 
to  that  of  physical  trauma.  The  same  can  be  said  of  the  use  of  social  isolation 
(including  time  out).  We  know  this  neurobiologically.  The  same  brain  areas 
mediate  response  to  all  three,  and  all  are  ameliorated  by  the  same  class  of  drugs, 
opiates.  Jail  is  clearly  physical  punishment — particularly  solitary  confinement 
— even  when  nothing  violent  happens.  Third,  we  should  note  that  some 
misbegotten  actions  must  be  brought  to  a  halt  both  effectively  and  immediately, 
not  least  so  that  something  worse  doesn’t  happen.  What’s  the  proper  punishment 
for  someone  who  will  not  stop  poking  a  fork  into  an  electrical  socket?  Or  who 
runs  away  laughing  in  a  crowded  supermarket  parking  lot?  The  answer  is  simple: 
whatever  will  stop  it  fastest,  within  reason.  Because  the  alternative  could  be 
fatal. 

That’s  pretty  obvious,  in  the  case  of  parking  lot  or  outlet.  But  the  same  thing 
applies  in  the  social  realm,  and  that  brings  us  to  the  fourth  point  regarding 
excuses  for  physical  punishment.  The  penalties  for  misbehavior  (of  the  sort  that 
could  have  been  effectively  halted  in  childhood)  become  increasingly  severe  as 
children  get  older — and  it  is  disproportionately  those  who  remain  unsocialized 
effectively  by  age  four  who  end  up  punished  explicitly  by  society  in  their  later 
youth  and  early  adulthood.  Those  unconstrained  four-year-olds,  in  turn,  are  often 
those  who  were  unduly  aggressive,  by  nature,  at  age  two.  They  were  statistically 


more  likely  than  their  peers  to  kick,  hit,  bite  and  take  away  toys  (later  known  as 
stealing).  They  comprise  about  five  per  cent  of  boys,  and  a  much  smaller 
percentage  of  girls.  To  unthinkingly  parrot  the  magic  line  “There  is  no  excuse 
for  physical  punishment”  is  also  to  foster  the  delusion  that  teenage  devils 
magically  emerge  from  once-innocent  little  child-angels.  You’re  not  doing  your 
child  any  favors  by  overlooking  any  misbehavior  (particularly  if  he  or  she  is 
temperamentally  more  aggressive). 

To  hold  the  no  excuse  for  physical  punishment  theory  is  also  (fifth)  to  assume 
that  the  word  no  can  be  effectively  uttered  to  another  person  in  the  absence  of 
the  threat  of  punishment.  A  woman  can  say  no  to  a  powerful,  narcissistic  man 
only  because  she  has  social  norms,  the  law  and  the  state  backing  her  up.  A  parent 
can  only  say  no  to  a  child  who  wants  a  third  piece  of  cake  because  he  or  she  is 
larger,  stronger  and  more  capable  than  the  child  (and  is  additionally  backed  up  in 
his  authority  by  law  and  state).  What  no  means,  in  the  final  analysis,  is  always 
“If  you  continue  to  do  that,  something  you  do  not  like  will  happen  to  you.” 
Otherwise  it  means  nothing.  Or,  worse,  it  means  “another  nonsensical  nothing 
muttered  by  ignorable  adults.”  Or,  worse  still,  it  means,  “all  adults  are  ineffectual 
and  weak.”  This  is  a  particularly  bad  lesson,  when  every  child’s  destiny  is  to 
become  an  adult,  and  when  most  things  that  are  learned  without  undue  personal 
pain  are  modelled  or  explicitly  taught  by  adults).  What  does  a  child  who  ignores 
adults  and  holds  them  in  contempt  have  to  look  forward  to?  Why  grow  up  at  all? 
And  that’s  the  story  of  Peter  Pan,  who  thinks  all  adults  are  variants  of  Captain 
Hook,  tyrannical  and  terrified  of  his  own  mortality  (think  hungry  crocodile  with 
clock  in  his  stomach).  The  only  time  no  ever  means  no  in  the  absence  of 
violence  is  when  it  is  uttered  by  one  civilized  person  to  another. 

And  what  about  the  idea  that  hitting  a  child  merely  teaches  them  to  hit ?  First: 
No.  Wrong.  Too  simple.  For  starters,  “hitting”  is  a  very  unsophisticated  word  to 
describe  the  disciplinary  act  of  an  effective  parent.  If  “hitting”  accurately 
described  the  entire  range  of  physical  force,  then  there  would  be  no  difference 
between  rain  droplets  and  atom  bombs.  Magnitude  matters — and  so  does 
context,  if  we’re  not  being  wilfully  blind  and  naive  about  the  issue.  Every  child 
knows  the  difference  between  being  bitten  by  a  mean,  unprovoked  dog  and  being 
nipped  by  his  own  pet  when  he  tries  playfully  but  too  carelessly  to  take  its  bone. 
How  hard  someone  is  hit,  and  why  they  are  hit,  cannot  merely  be  ignored  when 
speaking  of  hitting.  Timing,  part  of  context,  is  also  of  crucial  importance.  If  you 
flick  your  two-year-old  with  your  finger  just  after  he  smacks  the  baby  on  the 
head  with  a  wooden  block,  he  will  get  the  connection,  and  be  at  least  somewhat 
less  willing  to  smack  her  again  in  the  future.  That  seems  like  a  good  outcome. 

He  certainly  won’t  conclude  that  he  should  hit  her  more,  using  the  flick  of  his 


mother’s  finger  as  an  example.  He’s  not  stupid.  He’s  just  jealous,  impulsive  and 
not  very  sophisticated.  And  how  else  are  you  going  to  protect  his  younger 
sibling?  If  you  discipline  ineffectively,  then  the  baby  will  suffer.  Maybe  for 
years.  The  bullying  will  continue,  because  you  won’t  do  a  damn  thing  to  stop  it. 
You’ll  avoid  the  conflict  that’s  necessary  to  establish  peace.  You’ll  turn  a  blind 
eye.  And  then  later,  when  the  younger  child  confronts  you  (maybe  even  in 
adulthood),  you’ll  say,  “I  never  knew  it  was  like  that.”  You  just  didn’t  want  to 
know.  So,  you  didn’t.  You  just  rejected  the  responsibility  of  discipline,  and 
justified  it  with  a  continual  show  of  your  niceness.  Every  gingerbread  house  has 
a  witch  inside  it  that  devours  children. 

So  where  does  all  that  leave  us?  With  the  decision  to  discipline  effectively,  or 
to  discipline  ineffectively  (but  never  the  decision  to  forego  discipline  altogether, 
because  nature  and  society  will  punish  in  a  draconian  manner  whatever  errors  of 
childhood  behavior  remain  uncorrected).  So  here  are  a  few  practical  hints:  time 
out  can  be  an  extremely  effective  form  of  punishment,  particularly  if  the 
misbehaving  child  is  welcome  as  soon  as  he  controls  his  temper.  An  angry  child 
should  sit  by  himself  until  he  calms  down.  Then  he  should  be  allowed  to  return 
to  normal  life.  That  means  the  child  wins — instead  of  his  anger.  The  rule  is 
“Come  be  with  us  as  soon  as  you  can  behave  properly.”  This  is  a  very  good  deal 
for  child,  parent  and  society.  You’ll  be  able  to  tell  if  your  child  has  really 
regained  control.  You’ll  like  him  again,  despite  his  earlier  misbehaviour.  If 
you’re  still  mad,  maybe  he  hasn’t  completely  repented — or  maybe  you  should  do 
something  about  your  tendency  to  hold  a  grudge. 

If  your  child  is  the  kind  of  determined  varmint  who  simply  runs  away, 
laughing,  when  placed  on  the  steps  or  in  his  room,  physical  restraint  might  have 
to  be  added  to  the  time  out  routine.  A  child  can  be  held  carefully  but  firmly  by 
the  upper  arms,  until  he  or  she  stops  squirming  and  pays  attention.  If  that  fails, 
being  turned  over  a  parent’s  knee  might  be  required.  For  the  child  who  is 
pushing  the  limits  in  a  spectacularly  inspired  way,  a  swat  across  the  backside  can 
indicate  requisite  seriousness  on  the  part  of  a  responsible  adult.  There  are  some 
situations  in  which  even  that  will  not  suffice,  partly  because  some  children  are 
very  determined,  exploratory,  and  tough,  or  because  the  offending  behaviour  is 
truly  severe.  And  if  you’re  not  thinking  such  things  through,  then  you’re  not 
acting  responsibly  as  a  parent.  You’re  leaving  the  dirty  work  to  someone  else, 
who  will  be  much  dirtier  doing  it. 


A  Summary  of  Principles 


Disciplinary  principle  1:  limit  the  rules.  Principle  2:  use  minimum  necessary 
force.  Here’s  a  third:  parents  should  come  in  pairs.  Raising  young  children  is 
demanding  and  exhausting.  Because  of  this,  it’s  easy  for  a  parent  to  make  a 
mistake.  Insomnia,  hunger,  the  aftermath  of  an  argument,  a  hangover,  a  bad  day 
at  work — any  of  these  things  singly  can  make  a  person  unreasonable,  while  in 
combination  they  can  produce  someone  dangerous.  Under  such  circumstances,  it 
is  necessary  to  have  someone  else  around,  to  observe,  and  step  in,  and  discuss. 
This  will  make  it  less  likely  that  a  whiny  provocative  child  and  her  fed-up 
cranky  parent  will  excite  each  other  to  the  point  of  no  return.  Parents  should 
come  in  pairs  so  the  father  of  a  newborn  can  watch  the  new  mother  so  she  won’t 
get  worn  out  and  do  something  desperate  after  hearing  her  colicky  baby  wail 
from  eleven  in  the  evening  until  five  in  the  morning  for  thirty  nights  in  a  row.  I 
am  not  saying  we  should  be  mean  to  single  mothers,  many  of  whom  struggle 
impossibly  and  courageously — and  a  proportion  of  whom  have  had  to  escape, 
singly,  from  a  brutal  relationship — but  that  doesn’t  mean  we  should  pretend  that 
all  family  forms  are  equally  viable.  They’re  not.  Period. 

Here’s  a  fourth  principle,  one  that  is  more  particularly  psychological:  parents 
should  understand  their  own  capacity  to  be  harsh,  vengeful,  arrogant,  resentful, 
angry  and  deceitful.  Very  few  people  set  out,  consciously,  to  do  a  terrible  job  as 
father  or  mother,  but  bad  parenting  happens  all  the  time.  This  is  because  people 
have  a  great  capacity  for  evil,  as  well  as  good — and  because  they  remain 
willfully  blind  to  that  fact.  People  are  aggressive  and  selfish,  as  well  as  kind  and 
thoughtful.  For  this  reason,  no  adult  human  being — no  hierarchical,  predatory 
ape — can  truly  tolerate  being  dominated  by  an  upstart  child.  Revenge  will  come. 
Ten  minutes  after  a  pair  of  all-too-nice-and-patient  parents  have  failed  to  prevent 
a  public  tantrum  at  the  local  supermarket,  they  will  pay  their  toddler  back  with 
the  cold  shoulder  when  he  runs  up,  excited,  to  show  mom  and  dad  his  newest 
accomplishment.  Enough  embarrassment,  disobedience,  and  dominance 
challenge,  and  even  the  most  hypothetically  selfless  parent  will  become 
resentful.  And  then  the  real  punishment  will  begin.  Resentment  breeds  the  desire 
for  vengeance.  Fewer  spontaneous  offers  of  love  will  be  offered,  with  more 
rationalizations  for  their  absence.  Fewer  opportunities  for  the  personal 
development  of  the  child  will  be  sought  out.  A  subtle  turning  away  will  begin. 
And  this  is  only  the  beginning  of  the  road  to  total  familial  warfare,  conducted 
mostly  in  the  underworld,  underneath  the  false  facade  of  normality  and  love. 

This  frequently-travelled  path  is  much  better  avoided.  A  parent  who  is 
seriously  aware  of  his  or  her  limited  tolerance  and  capacity  for  misbehaviour 
when  provoked  can  therefore  seriously  plan  a  proper  disciplinary  strategy — 
particularly  if  monitored  by  an  equally  awake  partner — and  never  let  things 


degenerate  to  the  point  where  genuine  hatred  emerges.  Beware.  There  are  toxic 
families  everywhere.  They  make  no  rules  and  limit  no  misbehaviour.  The  parents 
lash  out  randomly  and  unpredictably.  The  children  live  in  that  chaos  and  are 
crushed,  if  they’re  timid,  or  rebel,  counterproductively,  if  they’re  tough.  It’s  not 
good.  It  can  get  murderous. 

Here’s  a  fifth  and  final  and  most  general  principle.  Parents  have  a  duty  to  act 
as  proxies  for  the  real  world — merciful  proxies,  caring  proxies — but  proxies, 
nonetheless.  This  obligation  supersedes  any  responsibility  to  ensure  happiness, 
foster  creativity,  or  boost  self-esteem.  It  is  the  primary  duty  of  parents  to  make 
their  children  socially  desirable.  That  will  provide  the  child  with  opportunity, 
self-regard,  and  security.  It’s  more  important  even  than  fostering  individual 
identity.  That  Holy  Grail  can  only  be  pursued,  in  any  case,  after  a  high  degree  of 
social  sophistication  has  been  established. 

The  Good  Child — and  the  Responsible  Parent 

A  properly  socialized  three-year-old  is  polite  and  engaging.  She’s  also  no 
pushover.  She  evokes  interest  from  other  children  and  appreciation  from  adults. 
She  exists  in  a  world  where  other  kids  welcome  her  and  compete  for  her 
attention,  and  where  adults  are  happy  to  see  her,  instead  of  hiding  behind  false 
smiles.  She  will  be  introduced  to  the  world  by  people  who  are  pleased  to  do  so. 
This  will  do  more  for  her  eventual  individuality  than  any  cowardly  parental 
attempt  to  avoid  day-to-day  conflict  and  discipline. 

Discuss  your  likes  and  dislikes  with  regards  to  your  children  with  your  partner 
or,  failing  that,  a  friend.  But  do  not  be  afraid  to  have  likes  and  dislikes.  You  can 
judge  suitable  from  unsuitable,  and  wheat  from  chaff.  You  realize  the  difference 
between  good  and  evil.  Having  clarified  your  stance — having  assessed  yourself 
for  pettiness,  arrogance  and  resentment — you  take  the  next  step,  and  you  make 
your  children  behave.  You  take  responsibility  for  their  discipline.  You  take 
responsibility  for  the  mistakes  you  will  inevitably  make  while  disciplining.  You 
can  apologize,  when  you’re  wrong,  and  learn  to  do  better. 

You  love  your  kids,  after  all.  If  their  actions  make  you  dislike  them,  think 
what  an  effect  they  will  have  on  other  people,  who  care  much  less  about  them 
than  you.  Those  other  people  will  punish  them,  severely,  by  omission  or 
commission.  Don’t  allow  that  to  happen.  Better  to  let  your  little  monsters  know 
what  is  desirable  and  what  is  not,  so  they  become  sophisticated  denizens  of  the 
world  outside  the  family. 

A  child  who  pays  attention,  instead  of  drifting,  and  can  play,  and  does  not 
whine,  and  is  comical,  but  not  annoying,  and  is  trustworthy — that  child  will  have 


friends  wherever  he  goes.  His  teachers  will  like  him,  and  so  will  his  parents.  If 
he  attends  politely  to  adults,  he  will  be  attended  to,  smiled  at  and  happily 
instructed.  He  will  thrive,  in  what  can  so  easily  be  a  cold,  unforgiving  and  hostile 
world.  Clear  rules  make  for  secure  children  and  calm,  rational  parents.  Clear 
principles  of  discipline  and  punishment  balance  mercy  and  justice  so  that  social 
development  and  psychological  maturity  can  be  optimally  promoted.  Clear  rules 
and  proper  discipline  help  the  child,  and  the  family,  and  society,  establish, 
maintain  and  expand  the  order  that  is  all  that  protects  us  from  chaos  and  the 
terrors  of  the  underworld,  where  everything  is  uncertain,  anxiety-provoking, 
hopeless  and  depressing.  There  are  no  greater  gifts  that  a  committed  and 
courageous  parent  can  bestow. 

Do  not  let  your  children  do  anything  that  makes  you  dislike  them. 


RULE  6 


SET  YOUR  HOUSE  IN  PERFECT  ORDER  BEFORE  YOU 
CRITICIZE  THE  WORLD 

A  RELIGIOUS  PROBLEM 

It  does  not  seem  reasonable  to  describe  the  young  man  who  shot  twenty  children 
and  six  staff  members  at  Sandy  Hook  Elementary  School  in  Newtown, 
Connecticut,  in  2012  as  a  religious  person.  This  is  equally  true  for  the  Colorado 
theatre  gunman  and  the  Columbine  High  School  killers.  But  these  murderous 
individuals  had  a  problem  with  reality  that  existed  at  a  religious  depth.  As  one  of 
the  members  of  the  Columbine  duo  wrote: 

The  human  race  isn’t  worth  fighting  for,  only  worth  killing.  Give  the  Earth  back  to  the  animals. 

They  deserve  it  infinitely  more  than  we  do.  Nothing  means  anything  anymore. 

People  who  think  such  things  view  Being  itself  as  inequitable  and  harsh  to  the 
point  of  corruption,  and  human  Being,  in  particular,  as  contemptible.  They 
appoint  themselves  supreme  adjudicators  of  reality  and  find  it  wanting.  They  are 
the  ultimate  critics.  The  deeply  cynical  writer  continues: 

If  you  recall  your  history,  the  Nazis  came  up  with  a  “final  solution”  to  the  Jewish  problem.. . . 

Kill  them  all.  Well,  in  case  you  haven’t  figured  it  out,  I  say  “KILL  MANKIND.”  No  one  should 
survive. 

For  such  individuals,  the  world  of  experience  is  insufficient  and  evil — so  to  hell 
with  everything! 

What  is  happening  when  someone  comes  to  think  in  this  manner?  A  great 
German  play,  Faust:  A  Tragedy,  written  by  Johann  Wolfgang  von  Goethe, 
addresses  that  issue.  The  play’s  main  character,  a  scholar  named  Heinrich  Faust, 
trades  his  immortal  soul  to  the  devil,  Mephistopheles.  In  return,  he  receives 
whatever  he  desires  while  still  alive  on  Earth.  In  Goethe’s  play,  Mephistopheles 
is  the  eternal  adversary  of  Being.  He  has  a  central,  defining  credo: 

I  am  the  spirit  who  negates 

and  rightly  so,  for  all  that  comes  to  be 

deserves  to  perish,  wretchedly. 

It  were  better  nothing  would  begin! 

Thus  everything  that  your  terms  sin, 
destruction,  evil  represent — 
that  is  my  proper  element. 


Goethe  considered  this  hateful  sentiment  so  important — so  key  to  the  central 
element  of  vengeful  human  destructiveness — that  he  had  Mephistopheles  say  it  a 
second  time,  phrased  somewhat  differently,  in  Part  II  of  the  play,  written  many 
years  later. 

People  think  often  in  the  Mephistophelean  manner,  although  they  seldom  act 
upon  their  thoughts  as  brutally  as  the  mass  murderers  of  school,  college  and 
theatre.  Whenever  we  experience  injustice,  real  or  imagined;  whenever  we 
encounter  tragedy  or  fall  prey  to  the  machinations  of  others;  whenever  we 
experience  the  horror  and  pain  of  our  own  apparently  arbitrary  limitations — the 
temptation  to  question  Being  and  then  to  curse  it  rises  foully  from  the  darkness. 
Why  must  innocent  people  suffer  so  terribly?  What  kind  of  bloody,  horrible 
planet  is  this,  anyway? 

Life  is  in  truth  very  hard.  Everyone  is  destined  for  pain  and  slated  for 
destruction.  Sometimes  suffering  is  clearly  the  result  of  a  personal  fault  such  as 
willful  blindness,  poor  decision-making  or  malevolence.  In  such  cases,  when  it 
appears  to  be  self-inflicted,  it  may  even  seem  just.  People  get  what  they  deserve, 
you  might  contend.  That’s  cold  comfort,  however,  even  when  true.  Sometimes,  if 
those  who  are  suffering  changed  their  behaviour,  then  their  lives  would  unfold 
less  tragically.  But  human  control  is  limited.  Susceptibility  to  despair,  disease, 
aging  and  death  is  universal.  In  the  final  analysis,  we  do  not  appear  to  be  the 
architects  of  our  own  fragility.  Whose  fault  is  it,  then? 

People  who  are  very  ill  (or,  worse,  who  have  a  sick  child)  will  inevitably  find 
themselves  asking  this  question,  whether  they  are  religious  believers  or  not.  The 
same  is  true  of  someone  who  finds  his  shirtsleeve  caught  in  the  gears  of  a  giant 
bureaucracy — who  is  suffering  through  a  tax  audit,  or  fighting  an  interminable 
lawsuit  or  divorce.  And  it’s  not  only  the  obviously  suffering  who  are  tormented 
by  the  need  to  blame  someone  or  something  for  the  intolerable  state  of  their 
Being.  At  the  height  of  his  fame,  influence  and  creative  power,  for  example,  the 
towering  Leo  Tolstoy  himself  began  to  question  the  value  of  human  existence. 

He  reasoned  in  this  way: 

My  position  was  terrible.  I  knew  that  I  could  find  nothing  in  the  way  of  rational  knowledge 
except  a  denial  of  life;  and  in  faith  I  could  find  nothing  except  a  denial  of  reason,  and  this  was 
even  more  impossible  than  a  denial  of  life.  According  to  rational  knowledge,  it  followed  that  life 
is  evil,  and  people  know  it.  They  do  not  have  to  live,  yet  they  have  lived  and  they  do  live,  just  as 
I  myself  had  lived,  even  though  I  had  known  for  a  long  time  that  life  is  meaningless  and  evil. 

Try  as  he  might,  Tolstoy  could  identify  only  four  means  of  escaping  from  such 
thoughts.  One  was  retreating  into  childlike  ignorance  of  the  problem.  Another 
was  pursuing  mindless  pleasure.  The  third  was  “continuing  to  drag  out  a  life  that 
is  evil  and  meaningless,  knowing  beforehand  that  nothing  can  come  of  it.”  He 


identified  that  particular  form  of  escape  with  weakness:  “The  people  in  this 
category  know  that  death  is  better  than  life,  but  they  do  not  have  the  strength  to 
act  rationally  and  quickly  put  an  end  to  the  delusion  by  killing  themselves.. . .” 

Only  the  fourth  and  final  mode  of  escape  involved  “strength  and  energy.  It 
consists  of  destroying  life,  once  one  has  realized  that  life  is  evil  and 
meaningless.”  Tolstoy  relentlessly  followed  his  thoughts: 

Only  unusually  strong  and  logically  consistent  people  act  in  this  manner.  Having  realized  all  the 
stupidity  of  the  joke  that  is  being  played  on  us  and  seeing  that  the  blessings  of  the  dead  are 
greater  than  those  of  the  living  and  that  it  is  better  not  to  exist,  they  act  and  put  an  end  to  this 
stupid  joke;  and  they  use  any  means  of  doing  it:  a  rope  around  the  neck,  water,  a  knife  in  the 
heart,  a  train. 

Tolstoy  wasn’t  pessimistic  enough.  The  stupidity  of  the  joke  being  played  on  us 
does  not  merely  motivate  suicide.  It  motivates  murder — mass  murder,  often 
followed  by  suicide.  That  is  a  far  more  effective  existential  protest.  By  June  of 
2016,  unbelievable  as  it  may  seem,  there  had  been  one  thousand  mass  killings 
(defined  as  four  or  more  people  shot  in  a  single  incident,  excluding  the  shooter) 
in  the  US  in  twelve  hundred  and  sixty  days.  That’s  one  such  event  on  five  of 
every  six  days  for  more  than  three  years.  Everyone  says,  “We  don’t  understand.” 
How  can  we  still  pretend  that?  Tolstoy  understood,  more  than  a  century  ago.  The 
ancient  authors  of  the  biblical  story  of  Cain  and  Abel  understood,  as  well,  more 
than  twenty  centuries  ago.  They  described  murder  as  the  first  act  of  post-Edenic 
history:  and  not  just  murder,  but  fratricidal  murder — murder  not  only  of  someone 
innocent  but  of  someone  ideal  and  good,  and  murder  done  consciously  to  spite 
the  creator  of  the  universe.  Today’s  killers  tell  us  the  same  thing,  in  their  own 
words.  Who  would  dare  say  that  this  is  not  the  worm  at  the  core  of  the  apple? 

But  we  will  not  listen,  because  the  truth  cuts  too  close  to  the  bone.  Even  for  a 
mind  as  profound  as  that  of  the  celebrated  Russian  author,  there  was  no  way  out. 
How  can  the  rest  of  us  manage,  when  a  man  of  Tolstoy’s  stature  admits  defeat? 
For  years,  he  hid  his  guns  from  himself  and  would  not  walk  with  a  rope  in  hand, 
in  case  he  hanged  himself. 

How  can  a  person  who  is  awake  avoid  outrage  at  the  world? 

Vengeance  or  Transformation 

A  religious  man  might  shake  his  fist  in  desperation  at  the  apparent  injustice  and 
blindness  of  God.  Even  Christ  Himself  felt  abandoned  before  the  cross,  or  so  the 
story  goes.  A  more  agnostic  or  atheistic  individual  might  blame  fate,  or  meditate 
bitterly  on  the  brutality  of  chance.  Another  might  tear  himself  apart,  searching 
for  the  character  flaws  underlying  his  suffering  and  deterioration.  These  are  all 


variations  on  a  theme.  The  name  of  the  target  changes,  but  the  underlying 
psychology  remains  constant.  Why?  Why  is  there  so  much  suffering  and  cruelty? 

Well,  perhaps  it  really  is  God’s  doing — or  the  fault  of  blind,  pointless  fate,  if 
you  are  inclined  to  think  that  way.  And  there  appears  to  be  every  reason  to  think 
that  way.  But,  what  happens  if  you  do?  Mass  murderers  believe  that  the  suffering 
attendant  upon  existence  justifies  judgment  and  revenge,  as  the  Columbine  boys 
so  clearly  indicated: 

I  will  sooner  die  than  betray  my  own  thoughts.  Before  I  leave  this  worthless  place,  I  will  kill 
who  ever  I  deem  unfit  for  anything,  especially  life.  If  you  pissed  me  off  in  the  past,  you  will  die 
if  I  see  you.  You  might  be  able  to  piss  off  others,  and  have  it  eventually  all  blow  over,  but  not 
me.  I  don’t  forget  people  who  wronged  me. 

One  of  the  most  vengeful  murderers  of  the  twentieth  century,  the  terrible  Carl 
Panzram,  was  raped,  brutalized  and  betrayed  in  the  Minnesota  institution 
responsible  for  his  “rehabilitation”  when  he  was  a  delinquent  juvenile.  He 
emerged,  enraged  beyond  measure,  as  burglar,  arsonist,  rapist  and  serial  killer. 

He  aimed  consciously  and  consistently  at  destruction,  even  keeping  track  of  the 
dollar  value  of  the  property  he  burned.  He  started  by  hating  the  individuals  who 
had  hurt  him.  His  resentment  grew,  until  his  hatred  encompassed  all  of  mankind, 
and  he  didn’t  stop  there.  His  destructiveness  was  aimed  in  some  fundamental 
manner  at  God  Himself.  There  is  no  other  way  of  phrasing  it.  Panzram  raped, 
murdered  and  burned  to  express  his  outrage  at  Being.  He  acted  as  if  Someone 
was  responsible.  The  same  thing  happens  in  the  story  of  Cain  and  Abel.  Cain’s 
sacrifices  are  rejected.  He  exists  in  suffering.  He  calls  out  God  and  challenges 
the  Being  He  created.  God  refuses  his  plea.  He  tells  Cain  that  his  trouble  is  self- 
induced.  Cain,  in  his  rage,  kills  Abel,  God’s  favourite  (and,  truth  be  known, 
Cain’s  idol).  Cain  is  jealous,  of  course,  of  his  successful  brother.  But  he  destroys 
Abel  primarily  to  spite  God.  This  is  the  truest  version  of  what  happens  when 
people  take  their  vengeance  to  the  ultimate  extreme. 

Panzram’s  response  was  (and  this  is  what  was  so  terrible)  perfectly 
understandable.  The  details  of  his  autobiography  reveal  that  he  was  one  of 
Tolstoy’s  strong  and  logically  consistent  people.  He  was  a  powerful,  consistent, 
fearless  actor.  He  had  the  courage  of  his  convictions.  How  could  someone  like 
him  be  expected  to  forgive  and  forget,  given  what  had  happened  to  him?  Truly 
terrible  things  happen  to  people.  It’s  no  wonder  they’re  out  for  revenge.  Under 
such  conditions,  vengeance  seems  a  moral  necessity.  How  can  it  be  distinguished 
from  the  demand  for  justice?  After  the  experience  of  terrible  atrocity,  isn’t 
forgiveness  just  cowardice,  or  lack  of  willpower?  Such  questions  torment  me. 

But  people  emerge  from  terrible  pasts  to  do  good,  and  not  evil,  although  such  an 
accomplishment  can  seem  superhuman. 


I  have  met  people  who  managed  to  do  it.  I  know  a  man,  a  great  artist,  who 
emerged  from  just  such  a  “school”  as  the  one  described  by  Panzram — only  this 
man  was  thrown  into  it  as  an  innocent  five-year-old,  fresh  from  a  long  stretch  in 
a  hospital,  where  he  had  suffered  measles,  mumps  and  chicken  pox, 
simultaneously.  Incapable  of  speaking  the  language  of  the  school,  deliberately 
isolated  from  his  family,  abused,  starved  and  otherwise  tormented,  he  emerged 
an  angry,  broken  young  man.  He  hurt  himself  badly  in  the  aftermath  with  drugs 
and  alcohol  and  other  forms  of  self-destructive  behaviour.  He  detested  everyone 
— God,  himself  and  blind  fate  included.  But  he  put  an  end  to  all  of  that.  He 
stopped  drinking.  He  stopped  hating  (although  it  still  emerges  in  flashes).  He 
revitalized  the  artistic  culture  of  his  Native  tradition,  and  trained  young  men  to 
continue  in  his  footsteps.  He  produced  a  fifty-foot  totem  pole  memorializing  the 
events  of  his  life,  and  a  canoe,  forty  feet  long,  from  a  single  log,  of  a  kind  rarely 
if  ever  produced  now.  He  brought  his  family  together,  and  held  a  great  potlatch, 
with  sixteen  hours  of  dancing  and  hundreds  of  people  in  attendance,  to  express 
his  grief,  and  make  peace  with  the  past.  He  decided  to  be  a  good  person,  and 
then  did  the  impossible  things  required  to  live  that  way. 

I  had  a  client  who  did  not  have  good  parents.  Her  mother  died  when  she  was 
very  young.  Her  grandmother,  who  raised  her,  was  a  harridan,  bitter  and  over¬ 
concerned  with  appearances.  She  mistreated  her  granddaughter,  punishing  her 
for  her  virtues:  creativity,  sensitivity,  intelligence — unable  to  resist  acting  out  her 
resentment  for  an  admittedly  hard  life  on  her  granddaughter.  She  had  a  better 
relationship  with  her  father,  but  he  was  an  addict  who  died,  badly,  while  she 
cared  for  him.  My  client  had  a  son.  She  perpetuated  none  of  this  with  him.  He 
grew  up  truthful,  and  independent,  and  hard-working,  and  smart.  Instead  of 
widening  the  tear  in  the  cultural  fabric  she  inherited,  and  transmitting  it,  she 
sewed  it  up.  She  rejected  the  sins  of  her  forefathers.  Such  things  can  be  done. 

Distress,  whether  psychic,  physical,  or  intellectual,  need  not  at  all  produce  nihilism  (that  is,  the 
radical  rejection  of  value,  meaning  and  desirability).  Such  distress  always  permits  a  variety  of 
interpretations. 

Nietzsche  wrote  those  words.  What  he  meant  was  this:  people  who  experience 
evil  may  certainly  desire  to  perpetuate  it,  to  pay  it  forward.  But  it  is  also  possible 
to  learn  good  by  experiencing  evil.  A  bullied  boy  can  mimic  his  tormentors.  But 
he  can  also  learn  from  his  own  abuse  that  it  is  wrong  to  push  people  around  and 
make  their  lives  miserable.  Someone  tormented  by  her  mother  can  learn  from 
her  terrible  experiences  how  important  it  is  to  be  a  good  parent.  Many,  perhaps 
even  most,  of  the  adults  who  abuse  children  were  abused  themselves  as  children. 
However,  the  majority  of  people  who  were  abused  as  children  do  not  abuse  their 


own  children.  This  is  a  well-established  fact,  which  can  be  demonstrated,  simply, 
arithmetically,  in  this  way:  if  one  parent  abused  three  children,  and  each  of  those 
children  had  three  children,  and  so  on,  then  there  would  be  three  abusers  the  first 
generation,  nine  the  second,  twenty-seven  the  third,  eighty-one  the  fourth — and 
so  on  exponentially.  After  twenty  generations,  more  than  ten  billion  would  have 
suffered  childhood  abuse:  more  people  than  currently  inhabit  the  planet.  But 
instead,  abuse  disappears  across  generations.  People  constrain  its  spread.  That’s 
a  testament  to  the  genuine  dominance  of  good  over  evil  in  the  human  heart. 

The  desire  for  vengeance,  however  justified,  also  bars  the  way  to  other 
productive  thoughts.  The  American/English  poet  T.  S.  Eliot  explained  why,  in 
his  play,  The  Cocktail  Party.  One  of  his  characters  is  not  having  a  good  time  of 
it.  She  speaks  of  her  profound  unhappiness  to  a  psychiatrist.  She  says  she  hopes 
that  all  her  suffering  is  her  own  fault.  The  psychiatrist  is  taken  aback.  He  asks 
why.  She  has  thought  long  and  hard  about  this,  she  says,  and  has  come  to  the 
following  conclusion:  if  it’s  her  fault,  she  might  be  able  to  do  something  about  it. 
If  it’s  God’s  fault,  however — if  reality  itself  is  flawed,  hell-bent  on  ensuring  her 
misery — then  she  is  doomed.  She  couldn’t  change  the  structure  of  reality  itself. 
But  maybe  she  could  change  her  own  life. 

Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn  had  every  reason  to  question  the  structure  of  existence 
when  he  was  imprisoned  in  a  Soviet  labour  camp,  in  the  middle  of  the  terrible 
twentieth  century.  He  had  served  as  a  soldier  on  the  ill-prepared  Russian  front 
lines  in  the  face  of  a  Nazi  invasion.  He  had  been  arrested,  beaten  and  thrown  into 
prison  by  his  own  people.  Then  he  was  struck  by  cancer.  He  could  have  become 
resentful  and  bitter.  His  life  had  been  rendered  miserable  by  both  Stalin  and 
Hitler,  two  of  the  worst  tyrants  in  history.  He  lived  in  brutal  conditions.  Vast 
stretches  of  his  precious  time  were  stolen  from  him  and  squandered.  He 
witnessed  the  pointless  and  degrading  suffering  and  death  of  his  friends  and 
acquaintances.  Then  he  contracted  an  extremely  serious  disease.  Solzhenitsyn 
had  cause  to  curse  God.  Job  himself  barely  had  it  as  hard. 

But  the  great  writer,  the  profound,  spirited  defender  of  truth,  did  not  allow  his 
mind  to  turn  towards  vengeance  and  destruction.  He  opened  his  eyes,  instead. 
During  his  many  trials,  Solzhenitsyn  encountered  people  who  comported 
themselves  nobly,  under  horrific  circumstances.  He  contemplated  their  behaviour 
deeply.  Then  he  asked  himself  the  most  difficult  of  questions:  had  he  personally 
contributed  to  the  catastrophe  of  his  life?  If  so,  how?  He  remembered  his 
unquestioning  support  of  the  Communist  Party  in  his  early  years.  He 
reconsidered  his  whole  life.  He  had  plenty  of  time  in  the  camps.  How  had  he 
missed  the  mark,  in  the  past?  How  many  times  had  he  acted  against  his  own 
conscience,  engaging  in  actions  that  he  knew  to  be  wrong?  How  many  times  had 


he  betrayed  himself,  and  lied?  Was  there  any  way  that  the  sins  of  his  past  could 
be  rectified,  atoned  for,  in  the  muddy  hell  of  a  Soviet  gulag? 

Solzhenitsyn  pored  over  the  details  of  his  life,  with  a  fine-toothed  comb.  He 
asked  himself  a  second  question,  and  a  third.  Can  I  stop  making  such  mistakes, 
now?  Can  I  repair  the  damage  done  by  my  past  failures,  now?  He  learned  to 
watch  and  to  listen.  He  found  people  he  admired;  who  were  honest,  despite 
everything.  He  took  himself  apart,  piece  by  piece,  let  what  was  unnecessary  and 
harmful  die,  and  resurrected  himself.  Then  he  wrote  The  Gulag  Archipelago,  a 
history  of  the  Soviet  prison  camp  system.  It’s  a  forceful,  terrible  book,  written 
with  the  overwhelming  moral  force  of  unvarnished  truth.  Its  sheer  outrage 
screamed  unbearably  across  hundreds  of  pages.  Banned  (and  for  good  reason)  in 
the  USSR,  it  was  smuggled  to  the  West  in  the  1970s,  and  burst  upon  the  world. 
Solzhenitsyn’s  writing  utterly  and  finally  demolished  the  intellectual  credibility 
of  communism,  as  ideology  or  society.  He  took  an  axe  to  the  trunk  of  the  tree 
whose  bitter  fruits  had  nourished  him  so  poorly — and  whose  planting  he  had 
witnessed  and  supported. 

One  man’s  decision  to  change  his  life,  instead  of  cursing  fate,  shook  the  whole 
pathological  system  of  communist  tyranny  to  its  core.  It  crumbled  entirely,  not 
so  many  years  later,  and  Solzhenitsyn’s  courage  was  not  the  least  of  the  reasons 
why.  He  was  not  the  only  such  person  to  perform  such  a  miracle.  Vaclav  Havel, 
the  persecuted  writer  who  later,  impossibly,  became  the  president  of 
Czechoslovakia,  then  of  the  new  Czech  Republic,  comes  to  mind,  as  does 
Mahatma  Gandhi. 

Things  Fall  Apart 

Whole  peoples  have  adamantly  refused  to  judge  reality,  to  criticize  Being,  to 
blame  God.  It’s  interesting  to  consider  the  Old  Testament  Hebrews  in  this  regard. 
Their  travails  followed  a  consistent  pattern.  The  stories  of  Adam  and  Eve  and 
Cain  and  Abel  and  Noah  and  the  Tower  of  Babel  are  truly  ancient.  Their  origins 
vanish  into  the  mysteries  of  time.  It’s  not  until  after  the  flood  story  in  Genesis 
that  something  like  history,  as  we  understand  it,  truly  starts.  It  starts  with 
Abraham.  Abraham’s  descendants  become  the  Hebrew  people  of  the  Old 
Testament,  also  known  as  the  Hebrew  Bible.  They  enter  a  covenant  with  Yahweh 
— with  God — and  begin  their  recognizably  historical  adventures. 

Under  the  leadership  of  a  great  man,  the  Hebrews  organize  themselves  into  a 
society,  and  then  an  empire.  As  their  fortunes  rise,  success  breeds  pride  and 
arrogance.  Corruption  raises  its  ugly  head.  The  increasingly  hubristic  state 
becomes  obsessed  with  power,  begins  to  forget  its  duty  to  the  widows  and 


orphans,  and  deviates  from  its  age-old  agreement  with  God.  A  prophet  arises.  He 
brazenly  and  publicly  reviles  the  authoritarian  king  and  faithless  country  for 
their  failures  before  God — an  act  of  blind  courage — telling  them  of  the  terrible 
judgment  to  come.  When  his  wise  words  are  not  completely  ignored,  they  are 
heeded  too  late.  God  smites  his  wayward  people,  dooming  them  to  abject  defeat 
in  battle  and  generations  of  subjugation.  The  Hebrews  repent,  at  length,  blaming 
their  misfortune  on  their  own  failure  to  adhere  to  God’s  word.  They  insist  to 
themselves  that  they  could  have  done  better.  They  rebuild  their  state,  and  the 
cycle  begins  again. 

This  is  life.  We  build  structures  to  live  in.  We  build  families,  and  states,  and 
countries.  We  abstract  the  principles  upon  which  those  structures  are  founded 
and  formulate  systems  of  belief.  At  first  we  inhabit  those  structures  and  beliefs 
like  Adam  and  Eve  in  Paradise.  But  success  makes  us  complacent.  We  forget  to 
pay  attention.  We  take  what  we  have  for  granted.  We  turn  a  blind  eye.  We  fail  to 
notice  that  things  are  changing,  or  that  corruption  is  taking  root.  And  everything 
falls  apart.  Is  that  the  fault  of  reality — of  God?  Or  do  things  fall  apart  because 
we  have  not  paid  sufficient  attention? 

When  the  hurricane  hit  New  Orleans,  and  the  town  sank  under  the  waves,  was 
that  a  natural  disaster?  The  Dutch  prepare  their  dikes  for  the  worst  storm  in  ten 
thousand  years.  Had  New  Orleans  followed  that  example,  no  tragedy  would  have 
occurred.  It’s  not  that  no  one  knew.  The  Flood  Control  Act  of  1965  mandated 
improvements  in  the  levee  system  that  held  back  Lake  Pontchartrain.  The  system 
was  to  be  completed  by  1978.  Forty  years  later,  only  60  percent  of  the  work  had 
been  done.  Willful  blindness  and  corruption  took  the  city  down. 

A  hurricane  is  an  act  of  God.  But  failure  to  prepare,  when  the  necessity  for 
preparation  is  well  known — that’s  sin.  That’s  failure  to  hit  the  mark.  And  the 
wages  of  sin  is  death  (Romans  6:23).  The  ancient  Jews  always  blamed 
themselves  when  things  fell  apart.  They  acted  as  if  God’s  goodness — the 
goodness  of  reality — was  axiomatic,  and  took  responsibility  for  their  own 
failure.  That’s  insanely  responsible.  But  the  alternative  is  to  judge  reality  as 
insufficient,  to  criticize  Being  itself,  and  to  sink  into  resentment  and  the  desire 
for  revenge. 

If  you  are  suffering — well,  that’s  the  norm.  People  are  limited  and  life  is 
tragic.  If  your  suffering  is  unbearable,  however,  and  you  are  starting  to  become 
corrupted,  here’s  something  to  think  about. 


Clean  Up  Your  Life 


Consider  your  circumstances.  Start  small.  Have  you  taken  full  advantage  of  the 
opportunities  offered  to  you?  Are  you  working  hard  on  your  career,  or  even  your 
job,  or  are  you  letting  bitterness  and  resentment  hold  you  back  and  drag  you 
down?  Have  you  made  peace  with  your  brother?  Are  you  treating  your  spouse 
and  your  children  with  dignity  and  respect?  Do  you  have  habits  that  are 
destroying  your  health  and  well-being?  Are  you  truly  shouldering  your 
responsibilities?  Have  you  said  what  you  need  to  say  to  your  friends  and  family 
members?  Are  there  things  that  you  could  do,  that  you  know  you  could  do,  that 
would  make  things  around  you  better? 

Have  you  cleaned  up  your  life? 

If  the  answer  is  no,  here’s  something  to  try:  Start  to  stop  doing  what  you  know 
to  be  wrong.  Start  stopping  today.  Don’t  waste  time  questioning  how  you  know 
that  what  you’re  doing  is  wrong,  if  you  are  certain  that  it  is.  Inopportune 
questioning  can  confuse,  without  enlightening,  as  well  as  deflecting  you  from 
action.  You  can  know  that  something  is  wrong  or  right  without  knowing  why. 
Your  entire  Being  can  tell  you  something  that  you  can  neither  explain  nor 
articulate.  Every  person  is  too  complex  to  know  themselves  completely,  and  we 
all  contain  wisdom  that  we  cannot  comprehend. 

So,  simply  stop,  when  you  apprehend,  however  dimly,  that  you  should  stop. 
Stop  acting  in  that  particular,  despicable  manner.  Stop  saying  those  things  that 
make  you  weak  and  ashamed.  Say  only  those  things  that  make  you  strong.  Do 
only  those  things  that  you  could  speak  of  with  honour. 

You  can  use  your  own  standards  of  judgment.  You  can  rely  on  yourself  for 
guidance.  You  don’t  have  to  adhere  to  some  external,  arbitrary  code  of  behaviour 
(although  you  should  not  overlook  the  guidelines  of  your  culture.  Life  is  short, 
and  you  don’t  have  time  to  figure  everything  out  on  your  own.  The  wisdom  of 
the  past  was  hard-earned,  and  your  dead  ancestors  may  have  something  useful  to 
tell  you). 

Don’t  blame  capitalism,  the  radical  left,  or  the  iniquity  of  your  enemies.  Don’t 
reorganize  the  state  until  you  have  ordered  your  own  experience.  Have  some 
humility.  If  you  cannot  bring  peace  to  your  household,  how  dare  you  try  to  rule  a 
city?  Let  your  own  soul  guide  you.  Watch  what  happens  over  the  days  and 
weeks.  When  you  are  at  work  you  will  begin  to  say  what  you  really  think.  You 
will  start  to  tell  your  wife,  or  your  husband,  or  your  children,  or  your  parents, 
what  you  really  want  and  need.  When  you  know  that  you  have  left  something 
undone,  you  will  act  to  correct  the  omission.  Your  head  will  start  to  clear  up,  as 
you  stop  filling  it  with  lies.  Your  experience  will  improve,  as  you  stop  distorting 
it  with  inauthentic  actions.  You  will  then  begin  to  discover  new,  more  subtle 
things  that  you  are  doing  wrong.  Stop  doing  those,  too.  After  some  months  and 


years  of  diligent  effort,  your  life  will  become  simpler  and  less  complicated.  Your 
judgment  will  improve.  You  will  untangle  your  past.  You  will  become  stronger 
and  less  bitter.  You  will  move  more  confidently  into  the  future.  You  will  stop 
making  your  life  unnecessarily  difficult.  You  will  then  be  left  with  the  inevitable 
bare  tragedies  of  life,  but  they  will  no  longer  be  compounded  with  bitterness  and 
deceit. 

Perhaps  you  will  discover  that  your  now  less-corrupted  soul,  much  stronger 
than  it  might  otherwise  have  been,  is  now  able  to  bear  those  remaining, 
necessary,  minimal,  inescapable  tragedies.  Perhaps  you  will  even  learn  to 
encounter  them  so  that  they  stay  tragic — merely  tragic — instead  of  degenerating 
into  outright  hellishness.  Maybe  your  anxiety,  and  hopelessness,  and  resentment, 
and  anger — however  murderous,  initially — will  recede.  Perhaps  your 
uncorrupted  soul  will  then  see  its  existence  as  a  genuine  good,  as  something  to 
celebrate,  even  in  the  face  of  your  own  vulnerability.  Perhaps  you  will  become 
an  ever-more-powerful  force  for  peace  and  whatever  is  good. 

Perhaps  you  will  then  see  that  if  all  people  did  this,  in  their  own  lives,  the 
world  might  stop  being  an  evil  place.  After  that,  with  continued  effort,  perhaps  it 
could  even  stop  being  a  tragic  place.  Who  knows  what  existence  might  be  like  if 
we  all  decided  to  strive  for  the  best?  Who  knows  what  eternal  heavens  might  be 
established  by  our  spirits,  purified  by  truth,  aiming  skyward,  right  here  on  the 
fallen  Earth? 

Set  your  house  in  perfect  order  before  you  criticize  the  world.

RULE  7 


PURSUE  WHAT  IS  MEANINGFUL  (NOT  WHAT  IS 
EXPEDIENT) 

GET  WHILE  THE  GETTING’S  GOOD 

Life  is  suffering.  That’s  clear.  There  is  no  more  basic,  irrefutable  truth.  It’s 
basically  what  God  tells  Adam  and  Eve,  immediately  before  he  kicks  them  out 
of  Paradise. 

Unto  the  woman  he  said,  I  will  greatly  multiply  thy  sorrow  and  thy  conception;  in  sorrow  thou 
shalt  bring  forth  children;  and  thy  desire  shall  be  to  thy  husband,  and  he  shall  rule  over  thee. 

And  unto  Adam  he  said,  Because  thou  hast  hearkened  unto  the  voice  of  thy  wife,  and  hast 
eaten  of  the  tree,  of  which  I  commanded  thee,  saying,  Thou  shalt  not  eat  of  it:  cursed  is  the 
ground  for  thy  sake;  in  sorrow  shalt  thou  eat  of  it  all  the  days  of  thy  life; 

Thorns  also  and  thistles  shall  it  bring  forth  to  thee;  and  thou  shalt  eat  the  herb  of  the  field; 

By  the  sweat  of  your  brow  you  will  eat  your  food  until  you  return  to  the  ground,  since  from  it 
you  were  taken;  for  dust  you  are  and  to  dust  you  will  return.”  (Genesis  3:16-19.  KJV) 

What  in  the  world  should  be  done  about  that? 

The  simplest,  most  obvious,  and  most  direct  answer?  Pursue  pleasure.  Follow 
your  impulses.  Live  for  the  moment.  Do  what’s  expedient.  Lie,  cheat,  steal, 
deceive,  manipulate — but  don’t  get  caught.  In  an  ultimately  meaningless 
universe,  what  possible  difference  could  it  make?  And  this  is  by  no  means  a  new 
idea.  The  fact  of  life’s  tragedy  and  the  suffering  that  is  part  of  it  has  been  used  to 
justify  the  pursuit  of  immediate  selfish  gratification  for  a  very  long  time. 

Short  and  sorrowful  is  our  life,  and  there  is  no  remedy  when  a  man  comes  to  his  end,  and  no  one 
has  been  known  to  return  from  Hades. 

Because  we  were  born  by  mere  chance,  and  hereafter  we  shall  be  as  though  we  had  never 
been;  because  the  breath  in  our  nostrils  is  smoke,  and  reason  is  a  spark  kindled  by  the  beating  of 
our  hearts. 

When  it  is  extinguished,  the  body  will  turn  to  ashes,  and  the  spirit  will  dissolve  like  empty  air. 

Our  name  will  be  forgotten  in  time  and  no  one  will  remember  our  works;  our  life  will  pass  away 
like  the  traces  of  a  cloud,  and  be  scattered  like  mist  that  is  chased  by  the  rays  of  the  sun  and 
overcome  by  its  heat. 

For  our  allotted  time  is  the  passing  of  a  shadow,  and  there  is  no  return  from  our  death, 
because  it  is  sealed  up  and  no  one  turns  back. 

Come,  therefore,  let  us  enjoy  the  good  things  that  exist,  and  make  use  of  the  creation  to  the 
full  as  in  youth. 

Let  us  take  our  fill  of  costly  wine  and  perfumes,  and  let  no  flower  of  spring  pass  by  us. 

Let  us  crown  ourselves  with  rosebuds  before  they  wither. 

Let  none  of  us  fail  to  share  in  our  revelry,  everywhere  let  us  leave  signs  of  enjoyment, 
because  this  is  our  portion,  and  this  our  lot. 

Let  us  oppress  the  righteous  poor  man;  let  us  not  spare  the  widow  nor  regard  the  gray  hairs  of 
the  aged. 


But  let  our  might  be  our  law  of  right,  for  what  is  weak  proves  itself  to  be  useless.  (Wisdom 
2:1-11,  RSV). 

The  pleasure  of  expediency  may  be  fleeting,  but  it’s  pleasure,  nonetheless,  and 
that’s  something  to  stack  up  against  the  terror  and  pain  of  existence.  Every  man 
for  himself,  and  the  devil  take  the  hindmost,  as  the  old  proverb  has  it.  Why  not 
simply  take  everything  you  can  get,  whenever  the  opportunity  arises?  Why  not 
determine  to  live  in  that  manner? 

Or  is  there  an  alternative,  more  powerful  and  more  compelling? 

Our  ancestors  worked  out  very  sophisticated  answers  to  such  questions,  but 
we  still  don’t  understand  them  very  well.  This  is  because  they  are  in  large  part 
still  implicit — manifest  primarily  in  ritual  and  myth  and,  as  of  yet,  incompletely 
articulated.  We  act  them  out  and  represent  them  in  stories,  but  we’re  not  yet  wise 
enough  to  formulate  them  explicitly.  We’re  still  chimps  in  a  troupe,  or  wolves  in 
a  pack.  We  know  how  to  behave.  We  know  who’s  who,  and  why.  We’ve  learned 
that  through  experience.  Our  knowledge  has  been  shaped  by  our  interaction  with 
others.  We’ve  established  predictable  routines  and  patterns  of  behavior — but  we 
don’t  really  understand  them,  or  know  where  they  originated.  They’ve  evolved 
over  great  expanses  of  time.  No  one  was  formulating  them  explicitly  (at  least  not 
in  the  dimmest  reaches  of  the  past),  even  though  we’ve  been  telling  each  other 
how  to  act  forever.  One  day,  however,  not  so  long  ago,  we  woke  up.  We  were 
already  doing,  but  we  started  noticing  what  we  were  doing.  We  started  using  our 
bodies  as  devices  to  represent  their  own  actions.  We  started  imitating  and 
dramatizing.  We  invented  ritual.  We  started  acting  out  our  own  experiences. 

Then  we  started  to  tell  stories.  We  coded  our  observations  of  our  own  drama  in 
these  stories.  In  this  manner,  the  information  that  was  first  only  embedded  in  our 
behaviour  became  represented  in  our  stories.  But  we  didn’t  and  still  don’t 
understand  what  it  all  means. 

The  Biblical  narrative  of  Paradise  and  the  Fall  is  one  such  story,  fabricated  by 
our  collective  imagination,  working  over  the  centuries.  It  provides  a  profound 
account  of  the  nature  of  Being,  and  points  the  way  to  a  mode  of 
conceptualization  and  action  well-matched  to  that  nature.  In  the  Garden  of  Eden, 
prior  to  the  dawn  of  self-consciousness — so  goes  the  story — human  beings  were 
sinless.  Our  primordial  parents,  Adam  and  Eve,  walked  with  God.  Then,  tempted 
by  the  snake,  the  first  couple  ate  from  the  tree  of  the  knowledge  of  good  and 
evil,  discovered  Death  and  vulnerability,  and  turned  away  from  God.  Mankind 
was  exiled  from  Paradise,  and  began  its  effortful  mortal  existence.  The  idea  of 
sacrifice  enters  soon  afterward,  beginning  with  the  account  of  Cain  and  Abel, 
and  developing  through  the  Abrahamic  adventures  and  the  Exodus:  After  much 
contemplation,  struggling  humanity  learns  that  God’s  favour  could  be  gained, 


and  his  wrath  averted,  through  proper  sacrifice — and,  also,  that  bloody  murder 
might  be  motivated  among  those  unwilling  or  unable  to  succeed  in  this  manner. 

The  Delay  of  Gratification 

When  engaging  in  sacrifice,  our  forefathers  began  to  act  out  what  would  be 
considered  a  proposition,  if  it  were  stated  in  words:  that  something  better  might 
be  attained  in  the  future  by  giving  up  something  of  value  in  the  present.  Recall,  if 
you  will,  that  the  necessity  for  work  is  one  of  the  curses  placed  by  God  upon 
Adam  and  his  descendants  in  consequence  of  Original  Sin.  Adam’s  waking  to 
the  fundamental  constraints  of  his  Being — his  vulnerability,  his  eventual  death — 
is  equivalent  to  his  discovery  of  the  future.  The  future:  that’s  where  you  go  to  die 
(hopefully,  not  too  soon).  Your  demise  might  be  staved  off  through  work; 
through  the  sacrifice  of  the  now  to  gain  benefit  later.  It  is  for  this  reason — 
among  others,  no  doubt — that  the  concept  of  sacrifice  is  introduced  in  the 
Biblical  chapter  immediately  following  the  drama  of  the  Fall.  There  is  little 
difference  between  sacrifice  and  work.  They  are  also  both  uniquely  human. 
Sometimes,  animals  act  as  if  they  are  working,  but  they  are  really  only  following 
the  dictates  of  their  nature.  Beavers  build  dams.  They  do  so  because  they  are 
beavers,  and  beavers  build  dams.  They  don’t  think,  “Yeah,  but  I’d  rather  be  on  a 
beach  in  Mexico  with  my  girlfriend,”  while  they’re  doing  it. 

Prosaically,  such  sacrifice — work — is  delay  of  gratification,  but  that’s  a  very 
mundane  phrase  to  describe  something  of  such  profound  significance.  The 
discovery  that  gratification  could  be  delayed  was  simultaneously  the  discovery 
of  time  and,  with  it,  causality  (at  least  the  causal  force  of  voluntary  human 
action).  Long  ago,  in  the  dim  mists  of  time,  we  began  to  realize  that  reality  was 
structured  as  if  it  could  be  bargained  with.  We  learned  that  behaving  properly 
now,  in  the  present — regulating  our  impulses,  considering  the  plight  of  others — 
could  bring  rewards  in  the  future,  in  a  time  and  place  that  did  not  yet  exist.  We 
began  to  inhibit,  control  and  organize  our  immediate  impulses,  so  that  we  could 
stop  interfering  with  other  people  and  our  future  selves.  Doing  so  was 
indistinguishable  from  organizing  society:  the  discovery  of  the  causal 
relationship  between  our  efforts  today  and  the  quality  of  tomorrow  motivated  the 
social  contract — the  organization  that  enables  today’s  work  to  be  stored,  reliably 
(mostly  in  the  form  of  promises  from  others). 

Understanding  is  often  acted  out  before  it  can  be  articulated  (just  as  a  child 
acts  out  what  it  means  to  be  “mother”  or  “father”  before  being  able  to  give  a 
spoken  account  of  what  those  roles  mean).  The  act  of  making  a  ritual  sacrifice 
to  God  was  an  early  and  sophisticated  enactment  of  the  idea  of  the  usefulness  of 


delay.  There  is  a  long  conceptual  journey  between  merely  feasting  hungrily  and 
learning  to  set  aside  some  extra  meat,  smoked  by  the  fire,  for  the  end  of  the  day, 
or  for  someone  who  isn’t  present.  It  takes  a  long  time  to  learn  to  keep  anything 
later  for  yourself,  or  to  share  it  with  someone  else  (and  those  are  very  much  the 
same  thing  as,  in  the  former  case,  you  are  sharing  with  your  future  self).  It  is 
much  easier  and  far  more  likely  to  selfishly  and  immediately  wolf  down 
everything  in  sight.  There  are  similar  long  journeys  between  every  leap  in 
sophistication  with  regard  to  delay  and  its  conceptualization:  short-term  sharing, 
storing  away  for  the  future,  representation  of  that  storage  in  the  form  of  records 
and,  later,  in  the  form  of  currency — and,  ultimately,  the  saving  of  money  in  a 
bank  or  other  social  institution.  Some  conceptualizations  had  to  serve  as 
intermediaries,  or  the  full  range  of  our  practices  and  ideas  surrounding  sacrifice 
and  work  and  their  representation  could  have  never  emerged. 

Our  ancestors  acted  out  a  drama,  a  fiction:  they  personified  the  force  that 
governs  fate  as  a  spirit  that  can  be  bargained  with,  traded  with,  as  if  it  were 
another  human  being.  And  the  amazing  thing  is  that  it  worked.  This  was  in  part 
because  the  future  is  largely  composed  of  other  human  beings — often  precisely 
those  who  have  watched  and  evaluated  and  appraised  the  tiniest  details  of  your 
past  behavior.  It’s  not  very  far  from  that  to  God,  sitting  above  on  high,  tracking 
your  every  move  and  writing  it  down  for  further  reference  in  a  big  book.  Here’s 
a  productive  symbolic  idea:  the  future  is  a  judgmental  father.  That’s  a  good  start. 
But  two  additional,  archetypal,  foundational  questions  arose,  because  of  the 
discovery  of  sacrifice,  of  work.  Both  have  to  do  with  the  ultimate  extension  of 
the  logic  of  work — which  is  sacrifice  now,  to  gain  later. 

First  question.  What  must  be  sacrificed?  Small  sacrifices  may  be  sufficient  to 
solve  small,  singular  problems.  But  it  is  possible  that  larger,  more 
comprehensive  sacrifices  might  solve  an  array  of  large  and  complex  problems, 
all  at  the  same  time.  That’s  harder,  but  it  might  be  better.  Adapting  to  the 
necessary  discipline  of  medical  school  will,  for  example,  fatally  interfere  with 
the  licentious  lifestyle  of  a  hardcore  undergraduate  party  animal.  Giving  that  up 
is  a  sacrifice.  But  a  physician  can — to  paraphrase  George  W. — really  put  food  on 
his  family.  That’s  a  lot  of  trouble  dispensed  with,  over  a  very  long  period  of 
time.  So,  sacrifices  are  necessary,  to  improve  the  future,  and  larger  sacrifices  can 
be  better. 

Second  question  (set  of  related  questions,  really):  We’ve  already  established 
the  basic  principle — sacrifice  will  improve  the  future.  But  a  principle,  once 
established,  has  to  be  fleshed  out.  Its  full  extension  or  significance  has  to  be 
understood.  What  is  implied  by  the  idea  that  sacrifice  will  improve  the  future,  in 
the  most  extreme  and  final  of  cases?  Where  does  that  basic  principle  find  its 


limits?  We  must  ask,  to  begin,  “What  would  be  the  largest,  most  effective — most 
pleasing — of  all  possible  sacrifices?”  and  then  “How  good  might  the  best 
possible  future  be,  if  the  most  effective  sacrifice  could  be  made?” 

The  biblical  story  of  Cain  and  Abel,  Adam  and  Eve’s  sons,  immediately 
follows  the  story  of  the  expulsion  from  Paradise,  as  mentioned  previously.  Cain 
and  Abel  are  really  the  first  humans,  since  their  parents  were  made  directly  by 
God,  and  not  born  in  the  standard  manner.  Cain  and  Abel  live  in  history,  not  in 
Eden.  They  must  work.  They  must  make  sacrifices,  to  please  God,  and  they  do 
so,  with  altar  and  proper  ritual.  But  things  get  complicated.  Abel’s  offerings 
please  God,  but  Cain’s  do  not.  Abel  is  rewarded,  many  times  over,  but  Cain  is 
not.  It’s  not  precisely  clear  why  (although  the  text  strongly  hints  that  Cain’s  heart 
is  just  not  in  it).  Maybe  the  quality  of  what  Cain  put  forward  was  low.  Maybe  his 
spirit  was  begrudging.  Or  maybe  God  was  vexed,  for  some  secret  reasons  of  His 
own.  And  all  of  this  is  realistic,  including  the  text’s  vagueness  of  explanation. 
Not  all  sacrifices  are  of  equal  quality.  Furthermore,  it  often  appears  that 
sacrifices  of  apparently  high  quality  are  not  rewarded  with  a  better  future — and 
it’s  not  clear  why.  Why  isn’t  God  happy?  What  would  have  to  change  to  make 
Him  so?  Those  are  difficult  questions — and  everyone  asks  them,  all  the  time, 
even  if  they  don’t  notice. 

Asking  such  questions  is  indistinguishable  from  thinking. 

The  realization  that  pleasure  could  be  usefully  forestalled  dawned  on  us  with 
great  difficulty.  It  runs  absolutely  contrary  to  our  ancient,  fundamental  animal 
instincts,  which  demand  immediate  satisfaction  (particularly  under  conditions  of 
deprivation,  which  are  both  inevitable  and  commonplace).  And,  to  complicate 
the  matter,  such  delay  only  becomes  useful  when  civilization  has  stabilized  itself 
enough  to  guarantee  the  existence  of  the  delayed  reward,  in  the  future.  If 
everything  you  save  will  be  destroyed  or,  worse,  stolen,  there  is  no  point  in 
saving.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  a  wolf  will  down  twenty  pounds  of  raw  meat  in  a 
single  meal.  He  isn’t  thinking,  “Man,  I  hate  it  when  I  binge.  I  should  save  some 
of  this  for  next  week.”  So  how  was  it  that  those  two  impossible  and  necessarily 
simultaneous  accomplishments  (delay  and  the  stabilization  of  society  into  the 
future)  could  possibly  have  manifested  themselves? 

Here  is  a  developmental  progression,  from  animal  to  human.  It’s  wrong,  no 
doubt,  in  the  details.  But  it’s  sufficiently  correct,  for  our  purposes,  in  theme: 

First,  there  is  excess  food.  Large  carcasses,  mammoths  or  other  massive 
herbivores,  might  provide  that.  (We  ate  a  lot  of  mammoths.  Maybe  all  of  them.) 
After  a  kill,  with  a  large  animal,  there  is  some  left  for  later.  That’s  accidental,  at 
first — but,  eventually,  the  utility  of  “for  later”  starts  to  be  appreciated.  Some 
provisional  notion  of  sacrifice  develops  at  the  same  time:  “If  I  leave  some,  even 


if  I  want  it  now,  I  won’t  have  to  be  hungry  later.”  That  provisional  notion 
develops,  to  the  next  level  (“If  I  leave  some  for  later,  I  won’t  have  to  go  hungry, 
and  neither  will  those  I  care  for”)  and  then  to  the  next  (“I  can’t  possibly  eat  all  of 
this  mammoth,  but  I  can’t  store  the  rest  for  too  long,  either.  Maybe  I  should  feed 
some  to  other  people.  Maybe  they’ll  remember,  and  feed  me  some  of  their 
mammoth,  when  they  have  some  and  I  have  none.  Then  I’ll  get  some  mammoth 
now,  and  some  mammoth  later.  That’s  a  good  deal.  And  maybe  those  I’m 
sharing  with  will  come  to  trust  me,  more  generally.  Maybe  then  we  could  trade 
forever”).  In  such  a  manner,  “mammoth”  becomes  “future  mammoth,”  and 
“future  mammoth”  becomes  “personal  reputation.”  That’s  the  emergence  of  the 
social  contract. 

To  share  does  not  mean  to  give  away  something  you  value,  and  get  nothing 
back.  That  is  instead  only  what  every  child  who  refuses  to  share  fears  it  means. 
To  share  means,  properly,  to  initiate  the  process  of  trade.  A  child  who  can’t  share 
— who  can’t  trade — can’t  have  any  friends,  because  having  friends  is  a  form  of 
trade.  Benjamin  Franklin  once  suggested  that  a  newcomer  to  a  neighbourhood 
ask  a  new  neighbour  to  do  him  or  her  a  favour,  citing  an  old  maxim:  He  that  has 
once  done  you  a  kindness  will  be  more  ready  to  do  you  another  than  he  whom 
you  yourself  have  obliged.  In  Franklin’s  opinion,  asking  someone  for 
something  (not  too  extreme,  obviously)  was  the  most  useful  and  immediate 
invitation  to  social  interaction.  Such  asking  on  the  part  of  the  newcomer 
provided  the  neighbour  with  an  opportunity  to  show  him-  or  herself  as  a  good 
person,  at  first  encounter.  It  also  meant  that  the  latter  could  now  ask  the  former 
for  a  favour,  in  return,  because  of  the  debt  incurred,  increasingly  their  mutual 
familiarity  and  trust.  In  that  manner  both  parties  could  overcome  their  natural 
hesitancy  and  mutual  fear  of  the  stranger. 

It  is  better  to  have  something  than  nothing.  It’s  better  yet  to  share  generously 
the  something  you  have.  It’s  even  better  than  that,  however,  to  become  widely 
known  for  generous  sharing.  That’s  something  that  lasts.  That’s  something  that’s 
reliable.  And,  at  this  point  of  abstraction,  we  can  observe  how  the  groundwork 
for  the  conceptions  reliable,  honest  and  generous  has  been  laid.  The  basis  for  an 
articulated  morality  has  been  put  in  place.  The  productive,  truthful  sharer  is  the 
prototype  for  the  good  citizen,  and  the  good  man.  We  can  see  in  this  manner  how 
from  the  simple  notion  that  “leftovers  are  a  good  idea”  the  highest  moral 
principles  might  emerge. 

It’s  as  if  something  like  the  following  happened  as  humanity  developed.  First 
were  the  endless  tens  or  hundreds  of  thousands  of  years  prior  to  the  emergence 
of  written  history  and  drama.  During  this  time,  the  twin  practices  of  delay  and 
exchange  begin  to  emerge,  slowly  and  painfully.  Then  they  become  represented, 


in  metaphorical  abstraction,  as  rituals  and  tales  of  sacrifice,  told  in  a  manner 
such  as  this:  “It’s  as  if  there  is  a  powerful  Figure  in  the  Sky,  who  sees  all,  and  is 
judging  you.  Giving  up  something  you  value  seems  to  make  Him  happy — and 
you  want  to  make  Him  happy,  because  all  Hell  breaks  loose  if  you  don’t.  So, 
practise  sacrificing,  and  sharing,  until  you  become  expert  at  it,  and  things  will  go 
well  for  you.” fnl  No  one  said  any  of  this,  at  least  not  so  plainly  and  directly.  But 
it  was  implicit  in  the  practice  and  then  in  the  stories. 

Action  came  first  (as  it  had  to,  as  the  animals  we  once  were  could  act  but 
could  not  think).  Implicit,  unrecognized  value  came  first  (as  the  actions  that 
preceded  thought  embodied  value,  but  did  not  make  that  value  explicit).  People 
watched  the  successful  succeed  and  the  unsuccessful  fail  for  thousands  and 
thousands  of  years.  We  thought  it  over,  and  drew  a  conclusion:  The  successful 
among  us  delay  gratification.  The  successful  among  us  bargain  with  the  future. 

A  great  idea  begins  to  emerge,  taking  ever-more-clearly-articulated  form,  in  ever 
more-clearly-articulated  stories:  What’s  the  difference  between  the  successful 
and  the  unsuccessful?  The  successful  sacrifice.  Things  get  better,  as  the 
successful  practise  their  sacrifices.  The  questions  become  increasingly  precise 
and,  simultaneously,  broader:  What  is  the  greatest  possible  sacrifice?  For  the 
greatest  possible  good?  And  the  answers  become  increasingly  deeper  and 
profound. 

The  God  of  Western  tradition,  like  so  many  gods,  requires  sacrifice.  We  have 
already  examined  why.  But  sometimes  He  goes  even  further.  He  demands  not 
only  sacrifice,  but  the  sacrifice  of  precisely  what  is  loved  best.  This  is  most 
starkly  portrayed  (and  most  confusingly  evident)  in  the  story  of  Abraham  and 
Isaac.  Abraham,  beloved  of  God,  long  wanted  a  son — and  God  promised  him 
exactly  that,  after  many  delays,  and  under  the  apparently  impossible  conditions 
of  old  age  and  a  long-barren  wife.  But  not  so  long  afterward,  when  the 
miraculously-borne  Isaac  is  still  a  child,  God  turns  around  and  in  unreasonable 
and  apparently  barbaric  fashion  demands  that  His  faithful  servant  offer  his  son  as 
a  sacrifice.  The  story  ends  happily:  God  sends  an  angel  to  stay  Abraham’s 
obedient  hand  and  accepts  a  ram  in  Isaac’s  stead.  That’s  a  good  thing,  but  it 
doesn’t  really  address  the  issue  at  hand:  Why  is  God’s  going  further  necessary? 
Why  does  He — why  does  life — impose  such  demands? 

We’ll  start  our  analysis  with  a  truism,  stark,  self-evident  and  understated: 
Sometimes  things  do  not  go  well.  That  seems  to  have  much  to  do  with  the  terrible 
nature  of  the  world,  with  its  plagues  and  famines  and  tyrannies  and  betrayals. 

But  here’s  the  rub:  sometimes,  when  things  are  not  going  well,  it’s  not  the  world 
that’s  the  cause.  The  cause  is  instead  that  which  is  currently  most  valued, 
subjectively  and  personally.  Why?  Because  the  world  is  revealed,  to  an 


indeterminate  degree,  through  the  template  of  your  values  (much  more  on  this  in 
Rule  10).  If  the  world  you  are  seeing  is  not  the  world  you  want,  therefore,  it’s 
time  to  examine  your  values.  It’s  time  to  rid  yourself  of  your  current 
presuppositions.  It’s  time  to  let  go.  It  might  even  be  time  to  sacrifice  what  you 
love  best,  so  that  you  can  become  who  you  might  become,  instead  of  staying 
who  you  are. 

There’s  an  old  and  possibly  apocryphal  story  about  how  to  catch  a  monkey 
that  illustrates  this  set  of  ideas  very  well.  First,  you  must  find  a  large,  narrow¬ 
necked  jar,  just  barely  wide  enough  in  diameter  at  the  top  for  a  monkey  to  put  its 
hand  inside.  Then  you  must  fill  the  jar  part  way  with  rocks,  so  it  is  too  heavy  for 
a  monkey  to  carry.  Then  you  must  to  scatter  some  treats,  attractive  to  monkeys, 
near  the  jar,  to  attract  one,  and  put  some  more  inside  the  jar.  A  monkey  will 
come  along,  reach  into  the  narrow  opening,  and  grab  while  the  grabbing’s  good. 
But  now  he  won’t  be  able  to  extract  his  fist,  now  full  of  treats,  from  the  too- 
narrow  opening  of  the  jar.  Not  without  unclenching  his  hand.  Not  without 
relinquishing  what  he  already  has.  And  that’s  just  what  he  won’t  do.  The 
monkey-catcher  can  just  walk  over  to  the  jar  and  pick  up  the  monkey.  The 
animal  will  not  sacrifice  the  part  to  preserve  the  whole. 

Something  valuable,  given  up,  ensures  future  prosperity.  Something  valuable, 
sacrificed,  pleases  the  Lord.  What  is  most  valuable,  and  best  sacrificed? — or, 
what  is  at  least  emblematic  of  that?  A  choice  cut  of  meat.  The  best  animal  in  a 
flock.  A  most  valued  possession.  What’s  above  even  that?  Something  intensely 
personal  and  painful  to  give  up.  That’s  symbolized,  perhaps,  in  God’s  insistence 
on  circumcision  as  part  of  Abraham’s  sacrificial  routine,  where  the  part  is 
offered,  symbolically,  to  redeem  the  whole.  What’s  beyond  that?  What  pertains 
more  closely  to  the  whole  person,  rather  than  the  part?  What  constitutes  the 
ultimate  sacrifice — for  the  gain  of  the  ultimate  prize? 

It’s  a  close  race  between  child  and  self.  The  sacrifice  of  the  mother,  offering 
her  child  to  the  world,  is  exemplified  profoundly  by  Michelangelo’s  great 
sculpture,  the  Pieta,  illustrated  at  the  beginning  of  this  chapter.  Michelangelo 
crafted  Mary  contemplating  her  Son,  crucified  and  ruined.  It’s  her  fault.  It  was 
through  her  that  He  entered  the  world  and  its  great  drama  of  Being.  Is  it  right  to 
bring  a  baby  into  this  terrible  world?  Every  woman  asks  herself  that  question. 
Some  say  no,  and  they  have  their  reasons.  Mary  answers  yes,  voluntarily, 
knowing  full  well  what’s  to  come — as  do  all  mothers,  if  they  allow  themselves  to 
see.  It’s  an  act  of  supreme  courage,  when  undertaken  voluntarily. 

In  turn,  Mary’s  son,  Christ,  offers  Himself  to  God  and  the  world,  to  betrayal, 
torture  and  death — to  the  very  point  of  despair  on  the  cross,  where  he  cries  out 
those  terrible  words:  my  God,  my  God,  why  hast  thou  forsaken  me?  (Matthew 


27:46).  That  is  the  archetypal  story  of  the  man  who  gives  his  all  for  the  sake  of 
the  better — who  offers  up  his  life  for  the  advancement  of  Being — who  allows 
God’s  will  to  become  manifest  fully  within  the  confines  of  a  single,  mortal  life. 
That  is  the  model  for  the  honourable  man.  In  Christ’s  case,  however — as  He 
sacrifices  Himself — God,  His  Father,  is  simultaneously  sacrificing  His  son.  It  is 
for  this  reason  that  the  Christian  sacrificial  drama  of  Son  and  Self  is  archetypal. 
It’s  a  story  at  the  limit,  where  nothing  more  extreme — nothing  greater — can  be 
imagined.  That’s  the  very  definition  of  “archetypal.”  That’s  the  core  of  what 
constitutes  “religious.” 

Pain  and  suffering  define  the  world.  Of  that,  there  can  be  no  doubt.  Sacrifice 
can  hold  pain  and  suffering  in  abeyance,  to  a  greater  or  lesser  degree — and 
greater  sacrifices  can  do  that  more  effectively  than  lesser.  Of  that,  there  can  be 
no  doubt.  Everyone  holds  this  knowledge  in  their  soul.  Thus,  the  person  who 
wishes  to  alleviate  suffering — who  wishes  to  rectify  the  flaws  in  Being;  who 
wants  to  bring  about  the  best  of  all  possible  futures;  who  wants  to  create  Heaven 
on  Earth — will  make  the  greatest  of  sacrifices,  of  self  and  child,  of  everything 
that  is  loved,  to  live  a  life  aimed  at  the  Good.  He  will  forego  expediency.  He  will 
pursue  the  path  of  ultimate  meaning.  And  he  will  in  that  manner  bring  salvation 
to  the  ever-desperate  world. 

But  is  such  a  thing  even  possible?  Is  this  simply  not  asking  too  much  of  the 
individual?  It’s  all  well  and  good  for  Christ,  it  might  be  objected — but  He  was 
the  veritable  Son  of  God.  But  we  do  have  other  examples,  some  much  less 
mythologized  and  archetypal.  Consider,  for  example,  the  case  of  Socrates,  the 
ancient  Greek  philosopher.  After  a  lifetime  of  seeking  the  truth  and  educating  his 
countrymen,  Socrates  faced  a  trial  for  crimes  against  the  city-state  of  Athens,  his 
hometown.  His  accusers  provided  him  with  plenty  of  opportunity  to  simply 
leave,  and  avoid  the  trouble.  But  the  great  sage  had  already  considered  and 
rejected  this  course  of  action.  His  companion  Hermogenes  observed  him  at  this 
time  discussing  “any  and  every  subject”  other  than  his  trial,  and  asked  him 
why  he  appeared  so  unconcerned.  Socrates  first  answered  that  he  had  been 
preparing  his  whole  life  to  defend  himself,  but  then  said  something  more 
mysterious  and  significant:  When  he  attempted  specifically  to  consider  strategies 
that  would  produce  acquittal  “by  fair  means  or  foul” 1  — or  even  when  merely 
considering  his  potential  actions  at  the  trial  — he  found  himself  interrupted  by 
his  divine  sign:  his  internal  spirit,  voice  or  daemon.  Socrates  discussed  this  voice 
at  the  trial  itself.  He  said  that  one  of  the  factors  distinguishing  him  from  other 
men  was  his  absolute  willingness  to  listen  to  its  warnings — to  stop  speaking 
and  cease  acting  when  it  objected.  The  Gods  themselves  had  deemed  him  wise 


above  other  men,  not  least  for  this  reason,  according  to  the  Delphic  Oracle 
herself,  held  to  be  a  reliable  judge  of  such  things.” 

Because  his  ever-reliable  internal  voice  objected  to  fleeing  (or  even  to 
defending  himself)  Socrates  radically  altered  his  view  of  the  significance  of  his 
trial.  He  began  to  consider  that  it  might  be  a  blessing,  rather  than  a  curse.  He  told 
Hermogenes  of  his  realization  that  the  spirit  to  whom  he  had  always  listened 
might  be  offering  him  a  way  out  of  life,  in  a  manner  “easiest  but  also  the  least 
irksome  to  one’s  friends,”  with  “sound  body  and  a  spirit  capable  of  showing 
kindliness”  and  absent  the  “throes  of  illness”  and  vexations  of  extreme  old 
age.  Socrates’  decision  to  accept  his  fate  allowed  him  to  put  away  mortal 
terror  in  the  face  of  death  itself,  prior  to  and  during  the  trial,  after  the  sentence 
was  handed  down,  and  even  later,  during  his  execution.  He  saw  that  his  life 
had  been  so  rich  and  full  that  he  could  let  it  go,  gracefully.  He  was  given  the 
opportunity  to  put  his  affairs  in  order.  He  saw  that  he  could  escape  the  terrible 
slow  degeneration  of  the  advancing  years.  He  came  to  understand  all  that  was 
happening  to  him  as  a  gift  from  the  gods.  He  was  not  therefore  required  to 
defend  himself  against  his  accusers — at  least  not  with  the  aim  of  pronouncing  his 
innocence,  and  escaping  his  fate.  Instead,  he  turned  the  tables,  addressing  his 
judges  in  a  manner  that  makes  the  reader  understand  precisely  why  the  town 
council  wanted  this  man  dead.  Then  he  took  his  poison,  like  a  man. 

Socrates  rejected  expediency,  and  the  necessity  for  manipulation  that 
accompanied  it.  He  chose  instead,  under  the  direst  of  conditions,  to  maintain  his 
pursuit  of  the  meaningful  and  the  true.  Twenty-five  hundred  years  later,  we 
remember  his  decision  and  take  comfort  from  it.  What  can  we  learn  from  this?  If 
you  cease  to  utter  falsehoods  and  live  according  to  the  dictates  of  your 
conscience,  you  can  maintain  your  nobility,  even  when  facing  the  ultimate  threat; 
if  you  abide,  truthfully  and  courageously,  by  the  highest  of  ideals,  you  will  be 
provided  with  more  security  and  strength  than  will  be  offered  by  any  short¬ 
sighted  concentration  on  your  own  safety;  if  you  live  properly,  fully,  you  can 
discover  meaning  so  profound  that  it  protects  you  even  from  the  fear  of  death. 

Could  all  that  possibly  be  true? 

Death,  Toil  and  Evil 

The  tragedy  of  self-conscious  Being  produces  suffering,  inevitable  suffering. 
That  suffering  in  turn  motivates  the  desire  for  selfish,  immediate  gratification — 
for  expediency.  But  sacrifice — and  work — serves  far  more  effectively  than  short¬ 
term  impulsive  pleasure  at  keeping  suffering  at  bay.  However,  tragedy  itself 


(conceived  of  as  the  arbitrary  harshness  of  society  and  nature,  set  against  the 
vulnerability  of  the  individual)  is  not  the  only — and  perhaps  not  even  the 
primary — source  of  suffering.  There  is  also  the  problem  of  evil  to  consider.  The 
world  is  set  hard  against  us,  of  a  certainty,  but  man’s  inhumanity  to  man  is 
something  even  worse.  Thus,  the  problem  of  sacrifice  is  compounded  in  its 
complexity:  it  is  not  only  privation  and  mortal  limitation  that  must  be  addressed 
by  work — by  the  willingness  to  offer,  and  to  give  up.  It  is  the  problem  of  evil  as 
well. 

Consider,  once  again,  the  story  of  Adam  and  Eve.  Life  becomes  very  hard  for 
their  children  (that’s  us)  after  the  fall  and  awakening  of  our  archetypal  parents. 
First  is  the  terrible  fate  awaiting  us  in  the  post-Paradisal  world — in  the  world  of 
history.  Not  the  least  of  this  is  what  Goethe  called  “our  creative,  endless  toil.” 
Humans  work,  as  we  have  seen.  We  work  because  we  have  awakened  to  the 
truth  of  our  own  vulnerability,  our  subjugation  to  disease  and  death,  and  wish  to 
protect  ourselves  for  as  long  as  possible.  Once  we  can  see  the  future,  we  must 
prepare  for  it,  or  live  in  denial  and  terror.  We  therefore  sacrifice  the  pleasures  of 
today  for  the  sake  of  a  better  tomorrow.  But  the  realization  of  mortality  and  the 
necessity  of  work  is  not  the  only  revelation  to  Adam  and  Eve  when  they  eat  the 
forbidden  Fruit,  wake  up,  and  open  their  eyes.  They  were  also  granted  (or  cursed 
by)  the  knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil. 

It  took  me  decades  to  understand  what  that  means  (to  understand  even  part  of 
what  that  means).  It’s  this:  once  you  become  consciously  aware  that  you, 
yourself,  are  vulnerable,  you  understand  the  nature  of  human  vulnerability,  in 
general.  You  understand  what  it’s  like  to  be  fearful,  and  angry,  and  resentful,  and 
bitter.  You  understand  what  pain  means.  And  once  you  truly  understand  such 
feelings  in  yourself,  and  how  they’re  produced,  you  understand  how  to  produce 
them  in  others.  It  is  in  this  manner  that  the  self-conscious  beings  that  we  are 
become  voluntarily  and  exquisitely  capable  of  tormenting  others  (and  ourselves, 
of  course — but  it’s  the  others  we  are  concerned  about  right  now).  We  see  the 
consequences  of  this  new  knowledge  manifest  themselves  when  we  meet  Cain 
and  Abel,  the  sons  of  Adam  and  Eve. 

By  the  time  of  their  appearance,  mankind  has  learned  to  make  sacrifices  to 
God.  On  altars  of  stone,  designed  for  that  purpose,  a  communal  ritual  is 
performed:  the  immolation  of  something  valuable,  a  choice  animal  or  portion 
thereof,  and  its  transformation  through  fire  to  the  smoke  (to  the  spirit)  that  rises 
to  Heaven  above.  In  this  manner,  the  idea  of  delay  is  dramatized,  so  that  the 
future  might  improve.  Abel’s  sacrifices  are  accepted  by  God,  and  he  flourishes. 
Cain’s,  however,  are  rejected.  He  becomes  jealous  and  bitter — and  it’s  no 
wonder.  If  someone  fails  and  is  rejected  because  he  refused  to  make  any 


sacrifices  at  all — well,  that’s  at  least  understandable.  He  may  still  feel  resentful 
and  vengeful,  but  knows  in  his  heart  that  he  is  personally  to  blame.  That 
knowledge  generally  places  a  limit  on  his  outrage.  It’s  much  worse,  however,  if 
he  had  actually  foregone  the  pleasures  of  the  moment — if  he  had  strived  and 
toiled  and  things  still  didn’t  work  out — if  he  was  rejected,  despite  his  efforts. 
Then  he’s  lost  the  present  and  the  future.  Then  his  work — his  sacrifice — has 
been  pointless.  Under  such  conditions,  the  world  darkens,  and  the  soul  rebels. 

Cain  is  outraged  by  his  rejection.  He  confronts  God,  accuses  Him,  and  curses 
His  creation.  That  proves  to  be  a  very  poor  decision.  God  responds,  in  no 
uncertain  terms,  that  the  fault  is  all  with  Cain — and  worse:  that  Cain  has 
knowingly  and  creatively  dallied  with  sin,  and  reaped  the  consequences.  This 
is  not  at  all  what  Cain  wanted  to  hear.  It’s  by  no  means  an  apology  on  God’s 
part.  Instead,  it’s  insult,  added  to  injury.  Cain,  embittered  to  the  core  by  God’s 
response,  plots  revenge.  He  defies  the  creator,  audaciously.  It’s  daring.  Cain 
knows  how  to  hurt.  He’s  self-conscious,  after  all — and  has  become  even  more 
so,  in  his  suffering  and  shame.  So,  he  murders  Abel  in  cold  blood.  He  kills  his 
brother,  his  own  ideal  (as  Abel  is  everything  Cain  wishes  to  be).  He  commits  this 
most  terrible  of  crimes  to  spite  himself,  all  of  mankind,  and  God  Himself,  all  at 
once.  He  does  it  to  wreak  havoc  and  gain  his  vengeance.  He  does  it  to  register 
his  fundamental  opposition  to  existence — to  protest  the  intolerable  vagaries  of 
Being  itself.  And  Cain’s  children — the  offspring,  as  it  were  of  both  his  body  and 
his  decision — are  worse.  In  his  existential  fury,  Cain  kills  once.  Lamech,  his 
descendant,  goes  much  further.  “I  have  slain  a  man  to  my  wounding,”  says 
Lamech,”  and  a  young  man  to  my  hurt.  If  Cain  shall  be  avenged  sevenfold,  truly 
Lamech  seventy  and  sevenfold”  (Genesis  4:23-24).  Tubulcain,  an  instructor  of 
“every  artificer  in  brass  and  iron”  (Genesis  4:22),  is  by  tradition  seven 
generations  from  Cain — and  the  first  creator  of  weapons  of  war.  And  next,  in  the 
Genesis  stories,  comes  the  flood.  The  juxtaposition  is  by  no  means  accidental. 

Evil  enters  the  world  with  self-consciousness.  The  toil  with  which  God  curses 
Adam — that’s  bad  enough.  The  trouble  in  childbirth  with  which  Eve  is  burdened 
and  her  consequent  dependence  on  her  husband  are  no  trivial  matters,  either. 
They  are  indicative  of  the  implicit  and  oft-agonizing  tragedies  of  insufficiency, 
privation,  brute  necessity  and  subjugation  to  illness  and  death  that 
simultaneously  define  and  plague  existence.  Their  mere  factual  reality  is 
sometimes  sufficient  to  turn  even  a  courageous  person  against  life.  It  has  been 
my  experience,  however,  that  human  beings  are  strong  enough  to  tolerate  the 
implicit  tragedies  of  Being  without  faltering — without  breaking  or,  worse, 
breaking  bad.  I  have  seen  evidence  of  this  repeatedly  in  my  private  life,  in  my 
work  as  a  professor,  and  in  my  role  as  a  clinical  practitioner.  Earthquakes, 


floods,  poverty,  cancer — we’re  tough  enough  to  take  on  all  of  that.  But  human 
evil  adds  a  whole  new  dimension  of  misery  to  the  world.  It  is  for  this  reason  that 
the  rise  of  self-consciousness  and  its  attendant  realization  of  mortality  and 
knowledge  of  Good  and  Evil  is  presented  in  the  early  chapters  of  Genesis  (and  in 
the  vast  tradition  that  surrounds  them)  as  a  cataclysm  of  cosmic  magnitude. 

Conscious  human  malevolence  can  break  the  spirit  even  tragedy  could  not 
shake.  I  remember  discovering  (with  her)  that  one  of  my  clients  had  been 
shocked  into  years  of  serious  post-traumatic  stress  disorder — daily  physical 
shaking  and  terror,  and  chronic  nightly  insomnia — by  the  mere  expression  on  her 
enraged,  drunken  boyfriend’s  face.  His  “fallen  countenance”  (Genesis  4:5) 
indicated  his  clear  and  conscious  desire  to  do  her  harm.  She  was  more  naive  than 
she  should  have  been,  and  that  predisposed  her  to  the  trauma,  but  that’s  not  the 
point:  the  voluntary  evil  we  do  one  another  can  be  profoundly  and  permanently 
damaging,  even  to  the  strong.  And  what  is  it,  precisely,  that  motivates  such  evil? 

It  doesn’t  make  itself  manifest  merely  in  consequence  of  the  hard  lot  of  life.  It 
doesn’t  even  emerge,  simply,  because  of  failure  itself,  or  because  of  the 
disappointment  and  bitterness  that  failure  often  and  understandably  engenders. 
But  the  hard  lot  of  life,  magnified  by  the  consequence  of  continually  rejected 
sacrifices  (however  poorly  conceptualized;  however  half-heartedly  executed)? 
That  will  bend  and  twist  people  into  the  truly  monstrous  forms  who  then  begin, 
consciously,  to  work  evil;  who  then  begin  to  generate  for  themselves  and  others 
little  besides  pain  and  suffering  (and  who  do  it  for  the  sake  of  that  pain  and 
suffering).  In  that  manner,  a  truly  vicious  circle  takes  hold:  begrudging  sacrifice, 
half-heartedly  undertaken;  rejection  of  that  sacrifice  by  God  or  by  reality  (take 
your  pick);  angry  resentment,  generated  by  that  rejection;  descent  into  bitterness 
and  the  desire  for  revenge;  sacrifice  undertaken  even  more  begrudgingly,  or 
refused  altogether.  And  it’s  Hell  itself  that  serves  as  the  destination  place  of  that 
downward  spiral. 

Life  is  indeed  “nasty,  brutish  and  short,”  as  the  English  philosopher  Thomas 
Hobbes  so  memorably  remarked.  But  man’s  capacity  for  evil  makes  it  worse. 
This  means  that  the  central  problem  of  life — the  dealing  with  its  brute  facts — is 
not  merely  what  and  how  to  sacrifice  to  diminish  suffering,  but  what  and  how  to 
sacrifice  to  diminish  suffering  and  evil — the  conscious  and  voluntary  and 
vengeful  source  of  the  worst  suffering.  The  story  of  Cain  and  Abel  is  one 
manifestation  of  the  archetypal  tale  of  the  hostile  brothers,  hero  and  adversary: 
the  two  elements  of  the  individual  human  psyche,  one  aimed  up,  at  the  Good, 
and  the  other,  down,  at  Hell  itself.  Abel  is  a  hero,  true:  but  a  hero  who  is 
ultimately  defeated  by  Cain.  Abel  could  please  God — a  non-trivial  and  unlikely 
accomplishment — but  he  could  not  overcome  human  evil.  For  this  reason,  Abel 


is  archetypally  incomplete.  Perhaps  he  was  naive,  although  a  vengeful  brother 
can  be  inconceivably  treacherous  and  subtil,  like  the  snake  in  Genesis  3:1.  But 
excuses — even  reasons — even  understandable  reasons — don’t  matter;  not  in  the 
final  analysis.  The  problem  of  evil  remained  unsolved  even  by  the  divinely 
acceptable  sacrifices  of  Abel.  It  took  thousands  of  additional  years  for  humanity 
to  come  up  with  anything  else  resembling  a  solution.  The  same  issue  emerges 
again,  in  its  culminating  form,  the  story  of  Christ  and  his  temptation  by  Satan. 
But  this  time  it’s  expressed  more  comprehensively — and  the  hero  wins. 

Evil,  Confronted 

Jesus  was  led  into  the  wilderness,  according  to  the  story,  “to  be  tempted  by  the 
Devil”  (Matthew  4:1),  prior  to  his  crucifixion.  This  is  the  story  of  Cain,  restated 
abstractly.  Cain  is  neither  content  nor  happy,  as  we  have  seen.  He’s  working 
hard,  or  so  he  thinks,  but  God  is  not  pleased.  Meanwhile,  Abel  is,  by  all 
appearances,  dancing  his  way  through  life.  His  crops  flourish.  Women  love  him. 
Worst  of  all,  he’s  a  genuinely  good  man.  Everyone  knows  it.  He  deserves  his 
good  fortune.  All  the  more  reason  to  envy  and  hate  him.  Things  do  not  progress 
well  for  Cain,  by  contrast,  and  he  broods  on  his  misfortune,  like  a  vulture  on  an 
egg.  He  strives,  in  his  misery,  to  give  birth  to  something  hellish  and,  in  doing  so, 
enters  the  desert  wilderness  of  his  own  mind.  He  obsesses  over  his  ill  fortune; 
his  betrayal  by  God.  He  nourishes  his  resentment.  He  indulges  in  ever  more 
elaborate  fantasies  of  revenge.  And  as  he  does  so,  his  arrogance  grows  to 
Luciferian  proportions.  “I’m  ill-used  and  oppressed,”  he  thinks.  “This  is  a  stupid 
bloody  planet.  As  far  as  I’m  concerned,  it  can  go  to  Hell.”  And  with  that,  Cain 
encounters  Satan  in  the  wilderness,  for  all  intents  and  purposes,  and  falls  prey  to 
his  temptations.  And  he  does  what  he  can  to  make  things  as  bad  as  possible, 
motivated  by  (in  John  Milton’s  imperishable  words): 

So  deep  a  malice,  to  confound  the  Race 

Of  Mankind  in  one  Root,  and  Earth  with  Hell 

to  mingle  and  involve — done  all  to  spite 

the  Great  Creator  . . . 

Cain  turns  to  Evil  to  obtain  what  Good  denied  him,  and  he  does  it  voluntarily, 
self-consciously  and  with  malice  aforethought. 

Christ  takes  a  different  path.  His  sojourn  in  the  desert  is  the  dark  night  of  the 
soul — a  deeply  human  and  universal  human  experience.  It’s  the  journey  to  that 
place  each  of  us  goes  when  things  fall  apart,  friends  and  family  are  distant, 
hopelessness  and  despair  reign,  and  black  nihilism  beckons.  And,  let  us  suggest, 
in  testament  to  the  exactitude  of  the  story:  forty  days  and  nights  starving  alone  in 


the  wilderness  might  take  you  exactly  to  that  place.  It  is  in  such  a  manner  that 
the  objective  and  subjective  worlds  come  crashing,  synchronistically,  together. 
Forty  days  is  a  deeply  symbolic  period  of  time,  echoing  the  forty  years  the 
Israelites  spent  wandering  in  the  desert  after  escaping  the  tyranny  of  Pharaoh  and 
Egypt.  Forty  days  is  a  long  time  in  the  underworld  of  dark  assumptions, 
confusion  and  fear — long  enough  to  journey  to  the  very  center,  which  is  Hell 
itself.  A  journey  there  to  see  the  sights  can  be  undertaken  by  anyone — anyone, 
that  is,  who  is  willing  to  take  the  evil  of  self  and  Man  with  sufficient  seriousness. 
A  bit  of  familiarity  with  history  can  help.  A  sojourn  through  the  totalitarian 
horrors  of  the  twentieth  century,  with  its  concentration  camps,  forced  labor  and 
murderous  ideological  pathologies  is  as  good  a  place  as  any  to  start — that,  and 
some  consideration  of  the  fact  that  worst  of  the  concentration  camp  guards  were 
human,  all-too-human,  too.  That’s  all  part  of  making  the  desert  story  real  again; 
part  of  updating  it,  for  the  modern  mind. 

“After  Auschwitz,”  said  Theodor  Adorno,  student  of  authoritarianism,  “there 
should  be  no  poetry.”  He  was  wrong.  But  the  poetry  should  be  about  Auschwitz. 
In  the  grim  wake  of  the  last  ten  decades  of  the  previous  millennium,  the  terrible 
destructiveness  of  man  has  become  a  problem  whose  seriousness  self-evidently 
dwarfs  even  the  problem  of  unredeemed  suffering.  And  neither  one  of  those 
problems  is  going  to  be  solved  in  the  absence  of  a  solution  to  the  other.  This  is 
where  the  idea  of  Christ’s  taking  on  the  sins  of  mankind  as  if  they  were  His  own 
becomes  key,  opening  the  door  to  deep  understanding  of  the  desert  encounter 
with  the  devil  himself.  “Homo  sum,  humani  nihil  a  me  alienum  puto,”  said  the 
Roman  playwright  Terence:  nothing  human  is  alien  to  me. 

“No  tree  can  grow  to  Heaven,”  adds  the  ever-terrifying  Carl  Gustav  Jung, 
psychoanalyst  extraordinaire,  “unless  its  roots  reach  down  to  Hell.”  Such  a 
statement  should  give  everyone  who  encounters  it  pause.  There  was  no 
possibility  for  movement  upward,  in  that  great  psychiatrist’s  deeply  considered 
opinion,  without  a  corresponding  move  down.  It  is  for  this  reason  that 
enlightenment  is  so  rare.  Who  is  willing  to  do  that?  Do  you  really  want  to  meet 
who’s  in  charge,  at  the  very  bottom  of  the  most  wicked  thoughts?  What  did  Eric 
Harris,  mass  murderer  of  the  Columbine  high  school,  write  so  incomprehensibly 
the  very  day  prior  to  massacring  his  classmates?  It’s  interesting,  when  I’m  in  my 
human  form,  knowing  I’m  going  to  die.  Everything  has  a  touch  of  triviality  to 
it.  Who  would  dare  explain  such  a  missive? — or,  worse,  explain  it  away? 

In  the  desert,  Christ  encounters  Satan  (see  Luke  4:1-13  and  Matthew  4:1-11). 
This  story  has  a  clear  psychological  meaning — a  metaphorical  meaning — in 
addition  to  whatever  else  material  and  metaphysical  alike  it  might  signify.  It 


means  that  Christ  is  forever  He  who  determines  to  take  personal  responsibility 
for  the  full  depth  of  human  depravity.  It  means  that  Christ  is  eternally  He  who  is 
willing  to  confront  and  deeply  consider  and  risk  the  temptations  posed  by  the 
most  malevolent  elements  of  human  nature.  It  means  that  Christ  is  always  he 
who  is  willing  to  confront  evil — consciously,  fully  and  voluntarily — in  the  form 
that  dwelt  simultaneously  within  Him  and  in  the  world.  This  is  nothing  merely 
abstract  (although  it  is  abstract);  nothing  to  be  brushed  over.  It’s  no  merely 
intellectual  matter. 

Soldiers  who  develop  post-traumatic  stress  disorder  frequently  develop  it  not 
because  of  something  they  saw,  but  because  of  something  they  did.  There  are 
many  demons,  so  to  speak,  on  the  battlefield.  Involvement  in  warfare  is 
something  that  can  open  a  gateway  to  Hell.  Now  and  then  something  climbs 
through  and  possesses  some  naive  farm-boy  from  Iowa,  and  he  turns  monstrous. 
He  does  something  terrible.  He  rapes  and  kills  the  women  and  massacres  the 
infants  of  My  Lai.  And  he  watches  himself  do  it.  And  some  dark  part  of  him 
enjoys  it — and  that  is  the  part  that  is  most  unforgettable.  And,  later,  he  will  not 
know  how  to  reconcile  himself  with  the  reality  about  himself  and  the  world  that 
was  then  revealed.  And  no  wonder. 

In  the  great  and  fundamental  myths  of  ancient  Egypt,  the  god  Horns — often 
regarded  as  a  precursor  to  Christ,  historically  and  conceptually  speaking  — 
experienced  the  same  thing,  when  he  confronted  his  evil  uncle  Set, fn2  usurper  of 
the  throne  of  Osiris,  Horus’s  father.  Horns,  the  all-seeing  Egyptian  falcon  god, 
the  Egyptian  eye  of  supreme,  eternal  attention  itself,  has  the  courage  to  contend 
with  Set’s  true  nature,  meeting  him  in  direct  combat.  In  the  struggle  with  his 
dread  uncle,  however,  his  consciousness  is  damaged.  He  loses  an  eye.  This  is 
despite  his  godly  stature  and  his  unparalleled  capacity  for  vision.  What  would  a 
mere  man  lose,  who  attempted  the  same  thing?  But  perhaps  he  might  gain  in 
internal  vision  and  understanding  something  proportional  to  what  he  loses  in 
perception  of  the  outside  world. 

Satan  embodies  the  refusal  of  sacrifice;  he  is  arrogance,  incarnate;  spite, 
deceit,  and  cruel,  conscious  malevolence.  He  is  pure  hatred  of  Man,  God  and 
Being.  He  will  not  humble  himself,  even  when  he  knows  full  well  that  he  should. 
Furthermore,  he  knows  exactly  what  he  is  doing,  obsessed  with  the  desire  for 
destruction,  and  does  it  deliberately,  thoughtfully  and  completely.  It  has  to  be 
him,  therefore — the  very  archetype  of  Evil — who  confronts  and  tempts  Christ, 
the  archetype  of  Good.  It  must  be  him  who  offers  to  the  Savior  of  Mankind, 
under  the  most  trying  of  conditions,  what  all  men  most  ardently  desire. 


Satan  first  tempts  the  starving  Christ  to  quell  His  hunger  by  transforming  the 
desert  rocks  into  bread.  Then  he  suggests  that  He  throw  Himself  off  a  cliff, 
calling  on  God  and  the  angels  to  break  His  fall.  Christ  responds  to  the  first 
temptation  by  saying,  “One  does  not  live  by  bread  alone,  but  by  every  word  that 
proceeds  from  the  mouth  of  God.”  What  does  this  answer  mean?  It  means  that 
even  under  conditions  of  extreme  privation,  there  are  more  important  things  than 
food.  To  put  it  another  way:  Bread  is  of  little  use  to  the  man  who  has  betrayed 
his  soul,  even  if  he  is  currently  starving. fn3  Christ  could  clearly  use  his  near¬ 
infinite  power,  as  Satan  indicates,  to  gain  bread,  now — to  break  his  fast — even, 
in  the  broader  sense,  to  gain  wealth,  in  the  world  (which  would  theoretically 
solve  the  problem  of  bread,  more  permanently).  But  at  what  cost?  And  to  what 
gain?  Gluttony,  in  the  midst  of  moral  desolation?  That’s  the  poorest  and  most 
miserable  of  feasts.  Christ  aims,  therefore,  at  something  higher:  at  the 
description  of  a  mode  of  Being  that  would  finally  and  forever  solve  the  problem 
of  hunger.  If  we  all  chose  instead  of  expedience  to  dine  on  the  Word  of  God? 
That  would  require  each  and  every  person  to  live,  and  produce,  and  sacrifice, 
and  speak,  and  share  in  a  manner  that  would  permanently  render  the  privation  of 
hunger  a  thing  of  the  past.  And  that’s  how  the  problem  of  hunger  in  the 
privations  of  the  desert  is  most  truly  and  finally  addressed. 

There  are  other  indications  of  this  in  the  gospels,  in  dramatic,  enacted  form. 
Christ  is  continually  portrayed  as  the  purveyor  of  endless  sustenance.  He 
miraculously  multiplies  bread  and  fish.  He  turns  water  into  wine.  What  does  this 
mean?  It’s  a  call  to  the  pursuit  of  higher  meaning  as  the  mode  of  living  that  is 
simultaneously  most  practical  and  of  highest  quality.  It’s  a  call  portrayed  in 
dramatic/literary  form:  live  as  the  archetypal  Saviour  lives,  and  you  and  those 
around  you  will  hunger  no  more.  The  beneficence  of  the  world  manifests  itself  to 
those  who  live  properly.  That’s  better  than  bread.  That’s  better  than  the  money 
that  will  buy  bread.  Thus  Christ,  the  symbolically  perfect  individual,  overcomes 
the  first  temptation.  Two  more  follow. 

“Throw  yourself  off  that  cliff,”  Satan  says,  offering  the  next  temptation.  “If 
God  exists,  He  will  surely  save  you.  If  you  are  in  fact  his  Son,  God  will  surely 
save  you.”  Why  would  God  not  make  Himself  manifest,  to  rescue  His  only 
begotten  Child  from  hunger  and  isolation  and  the  presence  of  great  evil?  But  that 
establishes  no  pattern  for  life.  It  doesn’t  even  work  as  literature.  The  deus  ex 
machina — the  emergence  of  a  divine  force  that  magically  rescues  the  hero  from 
his  predicament — is  the  cheapest  trick  in  the  hack  writer’s  playbook.  It  makes  a 
mockery  of  independence,  and  courage,  and  destiny,  and  free  will,  and 
responsibility.  Furthermore,  God  is  in  no  wise  a  safety  net  for  the  blind.  He’s  not 


someone  to  be  commanded  to  perform  magic  tricks,  or  forced  into  Self¬ 
revelation — not  even  by  His  own  Son. 

“Do  not  put  the  Lord  your  God  to  the  test”  (Matthew  4:7) — this  answer, 
though  rather  brief,  dispenses  with  the  second  temptation.  Christ  does  not 
casually  order  or  even  dare  ask  God  to  intervene  on  his  behalf.  He  refuses  to 
dispense  with  His  responsibility  for  the  events  of  His  own  life.  He  refuses  to 
demand  that  God  prove  His  presence.  He  refuses,  as  well,  to  solve  the  problems 
of  mortal  vulnerability  in  a  merely  personal  manner) — by  compelling  God  to 
save  Him — because  that  would  not  solve  the  problem  for  everyone  else  and  for 
all  time.  There  is  also  the  echo  of  the  rejection  of  the  comforts  of  insanity  in  this 
forgone  temptation.  Easy  but  psychotic  self-identification  as  the  merely  magical 
Messiah  might  well  have  been  a  genuine  temptation  under  the  harsh  conditions 
of  Christ’s  sojourn  in  the  desert.  Instead  He  rejects  the  idea  that  salvation — or 
even  survival,  in  the  shorter  term — depends  on  narcissistic  displays  of 
superiority  and  the  commanding  of  God,  even  by  His  Son. 

Finally  comes  the  third  temptation,  the  most  compelling  of  all.  Christ  sees  the 
kingdoms  of  the  world  laid  before  Him  for  the  taking.  That’s  the  siren  call  of 
earthly  power:  the  opportunity  to  control  and  order  everyone  and  everything. 
Christ  is  offered  the  pinnacle  of  the  dominance  hierarchy,  the  animalistic  desire 
of  every  naked  ape:  the  obedience  of  all,  the  most  wondrous  of  estates,  the 
power  to  build  and  to  increase,  the  possibility  of  unlimited  sensual  gratification. 
That’s  expedience,  writ  large.  But  that’s  not  all.  Such  expansion  of  status  also 
provides  unlimited  opportunity  for  the  inner  darkness  to  reveal  itself.  The  lust 
for  blood,  rape  and  destruction  is  very  much  part  of  power’s  attraction.  It  is  not 
only  that  men  desire  power  so  that  they  will  no  longer  suffer.  It  is  not  only  that 
they  desire  power  so  that  they  can  overcome  subjugation  to  want,  disease  and 
death.  Power  also  means  the  capacity  to  take  vengeance,  ensure  submission,  and 
crush  enemies.  Grant  Cain  enough  power  and  he  will  not  only  kill  Abel.  He  will 
torture  him,  first,  imaginatively  and  endlessly.  Then  and  only  then  will  he  kill 
him.  Then  he  will  come  after  everyone  else. 

There’s  something  above  even  the  pinnacle  of  the  highest  of  dominance 
hierarchies,  access  to  which  should  not  be  sacrificed  for  mere  proximal  success. 
It’s  a  real  place,  too,  although  not  to  be  conceptualized  in  the  standard 
geographical  sense  of  place  we  typically  use  to  orient  ourselves.  I  had  a  vision, 
once,  of  an  immense  landscape,  spread  for  miles  out  to  the  horizon  before  me.  I 
was  high  in  the  air,  granted  a  bird’s-eye  view.  Everywhere  I  could  see  great 
stratified  multi-storied  pyramids  of  glass,  some  small,  some  large,  some 
overlapping,  some  separate — all  akin  to  modern  skyscrapers;  all  full  of  people 
striving  to  reach  each  pyramid’s  very  pinnacle.  But  there  was  something  above 


that  pinnacle,  a  domain  outside  each  pyramid,  in  which  all  were  nested.  That  was 
the  privileged  position  of  the  eye  that  could  or  perhaps  chose  to  soar  freely 
above  the  fray;  that  chose  not  to  dominate  any  specific  group  or  cause  but 
instead  to  somehow  simultaneously  transcend  all.  That  was  attention,  itself,  pure 
and  untrammeled:  detached,  alert,  watchful  attention,  waiting  to  act  when  the 
time  was  right  and  the  place  had  been  established.  As  the  Tao  te  Ching  has  it: 

He  who  contrives,  defeats  his  purpose; 

and  he  who  is  grasping,  loses. 

The  sage  does  not  contrive  to  win, 

and  therefore  is  not  defeated; 

he  is  not  grasping,  so  does  not  lose. 

There  is  a  powerful  call  to  proper  Being  in  the  story  of  the  third  temptation.  To 
obtain  the  greatest  possible  prize — the  establishment  of  the  Kingdom  of  God  on 
Earth,  the  resurrection  of  Paradise — the  individual  must  conduct  his  or  her  life  in 
a  manner  that  requires  the  rejection  of  immediate  gratification,  of  natural  and 
perverse  desires  alike,  no  matter  how  powerfully  and  convincingly  and 
realistically  those  are  offered,  and  dispense,  as  well  with  the  temptations  of  evil. 
Evil  amplifies  the  catastrophe  of  life,  increasing  dramatically  the  motivation  for 
expediency  already  there  because  of  the  essential  tragedy  of  Being.  Sacrifice  of 
the  more  prosaic  sort  can  keep  that  tragedy  at  bay,  more  or  less  successfully,  but 
it  takes  a  special  kind  of  sacrifice  to  defeat  evil.  It  is  the  description  of  that 
special  sacrifice  that  has  preoccupied  the  Christian  (and  more  than  Christian) 
imagination  for  centuries.  Why  has  it  not  had  the  desired  effect?  Why  do  we 
remain  unconvinced  that  there  is  no  better  plan  than  lifting  our  heads  skyward, 
aiming  at  the  Good,  and  sacrificing  everything  to  that  ambition?  Have  we  merely 
failed  to  understand,  or  have  we  fallen,  wilfully  or  otherwise,  off  the  path? 

Christianity  and  its  Problems 

Carl  Jung  hypothesized  that  the  European  mind  found  itself  motivated  to 
develop  the  cognitive  technologies  of  science — to  investigate  the  material  world 
— after  implicitly  concluding  that  Christianity,  with  its  laser-like  emphasis  on 
spiritual  salvation,  had  failed  to  sufficiently  address  the  problem  of  suffering  in 
the  here-and-now.  This  realization  became  unbearably  acute  in  the  three  or  four 
centuries  before  the  Renaissance.  In  consequence,  a  strange,  profound, 
compensatory  fantasy  began  to  emerge,  deep  in  the  collective  Western  psyche, 
manifesting  itself  first  in  the  strange  musings  of  alchemy,  and  developing  only 
after  many  centuries  into  the  fully  articulated  form  of  science.  It  was  the 
alchemists  who  first  seriously  began  to  examine  the  transformations  of  matter, 


hoping  to  discover  the  secrets  of  health,  wealth  and  longevity.  These  great 
dreamers  (Newton  foremost  among  them  )  intuited  and  then  imagined  that  the 
material  world,  damned  by  the  Church,  held  secrets  the  revelation  of  which 
could  free  humanity  from  its  earthly  pain  and  limitations.  It  was  that  vision, 
driven  by  doubt,  that  provided  the  tremendous  collective  and  individual 
motivational  power  necessary  for  the  development  of  science,  with  its  extreme 
demands  on  individual  thinkers  for  concentration  and  delay  of  gratification. 

This  is  not  to  say  that  Christianity,  even  in  its  incompletely  realized  form,  was 
a  failure.  Quite  the  contrary:  Christianity  achieved  the  well-nigh  impossible.  The 
Christian  doctrine  elevated  the  individual  soul,  placing  slave  and  master  and 
commoner  and  nobleman  alike  on  the  same  metaphysical  footing,  rendering 
them  equal  before  God  and  the  law.  Christianity  insisted  that  even  the  king  was 
only  one  among  many.  For  something  so  contrary  to  all  apparent  evidence  to 
find  its  footing,  the  idea  that  that  worldly  power  and  prominence  were  indicators 
of  God’s  particular  favor  had  to  be  radically  de-emphasized.  This  was  partly 
accomplished  through  the  strange  Christian  insistence  that  salvation  could  not  be 
obtained  through  effort  or  worth — through  “works.”  Whatever  its  limitations, 

the  development  of  such  doctrine  prevented  king,  aristocrat  and  wealthy 
merchant  alike  from  lording  it  morally  over  the  commoner.  In  consequence,  the 
metaphysical  conception  of  the  implicit  transcendent  worth  of  each  and  every 
soul  established  itself  against  impossible  odds  as  the  fundamental  presupposition 
of  Western  law  and  society.  That  was  not  the  case  in  the  world  of  the  past,  and  is 
not  the  case  yet  in  most  places  in  the  world  of  the  present.  It  is  in  fact  nothing 
short  of  a  miracle  (and  we  should  keep  this  fact  firmly  before  our  eyes)  that  the 
hierarchical  slave-based  societies  of  our  ancestors  reorganized  themselves,  under 
the  sway  of  an  ethical/religious  revelation,  such  that  the  ownership  and  absolute 
domination  of  another  person  came  to  be  viewed  as  wrong. 

It  would  do  us  well  to  remember,  as  well,  that  the  immediate  utility  of  slavery 
is  obvious,  and  that  the  argument  that  the  strong  should  dominate  the  weak  is 
compelling,  convenient  and  eminently  practical  (at  least  for  the  strong).  This 
means  that  a  revolutionary  critique  of  everything  slave-owning  societies  valued 
was  necessary  before  the  practice  could  be  even  questioned,  let  alone  halted 
(including  the  idea  that  wielding  power  and  authority  made  the  slave-owner 
noble;  including  the  even  more  fundamental  idea  that  the  power  wielded  by  the 
slave-owner  was  valid  and  even  virtuous).  Christianity  made  explicit  the 
surprising  claim  that  even  the  lowliest  person  had  rights,  genuine  rights — and 
that  sovereign  and  state  were  morally  charged,  at  a  fundamental  level,  to 
recognize  those  rights.  Christianity  put  forward,  explicitly,  the  even  more 


incomprehensible  idea  that  the  act  of  human  ownership  degraded  the  slaver 
(previously  viewed  as  admiring  nobility)  much  or  even  more  than  the  slave.  We 
fail  to  understand  how  difficult  such  an  idea  is  to  grasp.  We  forget  that  the 
opposite  was  self-evident  throughout  most  of  human  history.  We  think  that  it  is 
the  desire  to  enslave  and  dominate  that  requires  explanation.  We  have  it 
backwards,  yet  again. 

This  is  not  to  say  that  Christianity  was  without  its  problems.  But  it  is  more 
appropriate  to  note  that  they  were  the  sort  of  problems  that  emerge  only  after  an 
entirely  different  set  of  more  serious  problems  has  been  solved.  The  society 
produced  by  Christianity  was  far  less  barbaric  than  the  pagan — even  the  Roman 
— ones  it  replaced.  Christian  society  at  least  recognized  that  feeding  slaves  to 
ravenous  lions  for  the  entertainment  of  the  populace  was  wrong,  even  if  many 
barbaric  practices  still  existed.  It  objected  to  infanticide,  to  prostitution,  and  to 
the  principle  that  might  means  right.  It  insisted  that  women  were  as  valuable  as 
men  (even  though  we  are  still  working  out  how  to  manifest  that  insistence 
politically).  It  demanded  that  even  a  society’s  enemies  be  regarded  as  human. 
Finally,  it  separated  church  from  state,  so  that  all-too-human  emperors  could  no 
longer  claim  the  veneration  due  to  gods.  All  of  this  was  asking  the  impossible: 
but  it  happened. 

As  the  Christian  revolution  progressed,  however,  the  impossible  problems  it 
had  solved  disappeared  from  view.  That’s  what  happens  to  problems  that  are 
solved.  And  after  the  solution  was  implemented,  even  the  fact  that  such  problems 
had  ever  existed  disappeared  from  view.  Then  and  only  then  could  the  problems 
that  remained,  less  amenable  to  quick  solution  by  Christian  doctrine,  come  to 
occupy  a  central  place  in  the  consciousness  of  the  West — come  to  motivate,  for 
example,  the  development  of  science,  aimed  at  resolving  the  corporeal,  material 
suffering  that  was  still  all-too-painfully  extant  within  successfully  Christianized 
societies.  The  fact  that  automobiles  pollute  only  becomes  a  problem  of  sufficient 
magnitude  to  attract  public  attention  when  the  far  worse  problems  that  the 
internal  combustion  engine  solves  has  vanished  from  view.  People  stricken  with 
poverty  don’t  care  about  carbon  dioxide.  It’s  not  precisely  that  C02  levels  are 
irrelevant.  It’s  that  they’re  irrelevant  when  you’re  working  yourself  to  death, 
starving,  scraping  a  bare  living  from  the  stony,  unyielding,  thorn-and-thistle- 
infested  ground.  It’s  that  they’re  irrelevant  until  after  the  tractor  is  invented  and 
hundreds  of  millions  stop  starving.  In  any  case,  by  the  time  Nietzsche  entered 
the  picture,  in  the  late  nineteenth  century,  the  problems  Christianity  had  left 
unsolved  had  become  paramount. 

Nietzsche  described  himself,  with  no  serious  overstatement,  as  philosophizing 
with  a  hammer.  His  devastating  critique  of  Christianity — already  weakened 


by  its  conflict  with  the  very  science  to  which  it  had  given  rise — involved  two 
main  lines  of  attack.  Nietzsche  claimed,  first,  that  it  was  precisely  the  sense  of 
truth  developed  in  the  highest  sense  by  Christianity  itself  that  ultimately  came  to 
question  and  then  to  undermine  the  fundamental  presuppositions  of  the  faith. 
That  was  partly  because  the  difference  between  moral  or  narrative  truth  and 
objective  truth  had  not  yet  been  fully  comprehended  (and  so  an  opposition  was 
presumed  where  none  necessarily  exists) — but  that  does  not  bely  the  point.  Even 
when  the  modern  atheists  opposed  to  Christianity  belittle  fundamentalists  for 
insisting,  for  example,  that  the  creation  account  in  Genesis  is  objectively  true, 
they  are  using  their  sense  of  truth,  highly  developed  over  the  centuries  of 
Christian  culture,  to  engage  in  such  argumentation.  Carl  Jung  continued  to 
develop  Nietzsche’s  arguments  decades  later,  pointing  out  that  Europe  awoke, 
during  the  Enlightenment,  as  if  from  a  Christian  dream,  noticing  that  everything 
it  had  heretofore  taken  for  granted  could  and  should  be  questioned.  “God  is 
dead,”  said  Nietzsche.  “God  remains  dead.  And  we  have  killed  him.  How  shall 
we,  murderers  of  all  murderers,  console  ourselves?  That  which  was  the  holiest 
and  mightiest  of  all  that  the  world  has  yet  possessed  has  bled  to  death  under  our 
knives.  Who  will  wipe  this  blood  off  us?” 

The  central  dogmas  of  the  Western  faith  were  no  longer  credible,  according  to 
Nietzsche,  given  what  the  Western  mind  now  considered  truth.  But  it  was  his 
second  attack — on  the  removal  of  the  true  moral  burden  of  Christianity  during 
the  development  of  the  Church — that  was  most  devastating.  The  hammer- 
wielding  philosopher  mounted  an  assault  on  an  early-established  and  then  highly 
influential  line  of  Christian  thinking:  that  Christianity  meant  accepting  the 
proposition  that  Christ’s  sacrifice,  and  only  that  sacrifice,  had  redeemed 
humanity.  This  did  not  mean,  absolutely,  that  a  Christian  who  believed  that 
Christ  died  on  the  cross  for  the  salvation  of  mankind  was  thereby  freed  from  any 
and  all  personal  moral  obligation.  But  it  did  strongly  imply  that  the  primary 
responsibility  for  redemption  had  already  been  borne  by  the  Saviour,  and  that 
nothing  too  important  to  do  remained  for  all-too-fallen  human  individuals. 

Nietzsche  believed  that  Paul,  and  later  the  Protestants  following  Luther,  had 
removed  moral  responsibility  from  Christ’s  followers.  They  had  watered  down 
the  idea  of  the  imitation  of  Christ.  This  imitation  was  the  sacred  duty  of  the 
believer  not  to  adhere  (or  merely  to  mouth)  a  set  of  statements  about  abstract 
belief  but  instead  to  actually  manifest  the  spirit  of  the  Saviour  in  the  particular, 
specific  conditions  of  his  or  her  life — to  realize  or  incarnate  the  archetype,  as 
Jung  had  it;  to  clothe  the  eternal  pattern  in  flesh.  Nietzsche  writes,  “The 
Christians  have  never  practiced  the  actions  Jesus  prescribed  them;  and  the 
impudent  garrulous  talk  about  the  ‘justification  by  faith’  and  its  supreme  and 


sole  significance  is  only  the  consequence  of  the  Church’s  lack  of  courage  and 
will  to  profess  the  works  Jesus  demanded.”  Nietzsche  was,  indeed,  a  critic 
without  parallel. 

Dogmatic  belief  in  the  central  axioms  of  Christianity  (that  Christ’s  crucifixion 
redeemed  the  world;  that  salvation  was  reserved  for  the  hereafter;  that  salvation 
could  not  be  achieved  through  works)  had  three  mutually  reinforcing 
consequences:  First,  devaluation  of  the  significance  of  earthly  life,  as  only  the 
hereafter  mattered.  This  also  meant  that  it  had  become  acceptable  to  overlook 
and  shirk  responsibility  for  the  suffering  that  existed  in  the  here-and-now; 
Second,  passive  acceptance  of  the  status  quo,  because  salvation  could  not  be 
earned  in  any  case  through  effort  in  this  life  (a  consequence  that  Marx  also 
derided,  with  his  proposition  that  religion  was  the  opiate  of  the  masses);  and, 
finally,  third,  the  right  of  the  believer  to  reject  any  real  moral  burden  (outside  of 
the  stated  belief  in  salvation  through  Christ),  because  the  Son  of  God  had 
already  done  all  the  important  work.  It  was  for  such  reasons  that  Dostoevsky, 
who  was  a  great  influence  on  Nietzsche,  also  criticized  institutional  Christianity 
(although  he  arguably  managed  it  in  a  more  ambiguous  but  also  more 
sophisticated  manner).  In  his  masterwork,  The  Brothers  Karamazov,  Dostoevsky 
has  his  atheist  superman,  Ivan,  tell  a  little  story,  “The  Grand  Inquisitor.”  A 
brief  review  is  in  order. 

Ivan  speaks  to  his  brother  Alyosha — whose  pursuits  as  a  monastic  novitiate  he 
holds  in  contempt — of  Christ  returning  to  Earth  at  the  time  of  the  Spanish 
Inquisition.  The  returning  Savior  makes  quite  a  ruckus,  as  would  be  expected. 

He  heals  the  sick.  He  raises  the  dead.  His  antics  soon  attract  attention  from  the 
Grand  Inquisitor  himself,  who  promptly  has  Christ  arrested  and  thrown  into  a 
prison  cell.  Later,  the  Inquisitor  pays  Him  a  visit.  He  informs  Christ  that  he  is  no 
longer  needed.  His  return  is  simply  too  great  a  threat  to  the  Church.  The 
Inquisitor  tells  Christ  that  the  burden  He  laid  on  mankind — the  burden  of 
existence  in  faith  and  truth — was  simply  too  great  for  mere  mortals  to  bear.  The 
Inquisitor  claims  that  the  Church,  in  its  mercy,  diluted  that  message,  lifting  the 
demand  for  perfect  Being  from  the  shoulders  of  its  followers,  providing  them 
instead  with  the  simple  and  merciful  escapes  of  faith  and  the  afterlife.  That  work 
took  centuries,  says  the  Inquisitor,  and  the  last  thing  the  Church  needs  after  all 
that  effort  is  the  return  of  the  Man  who  insisted  that  people  bear  all  the  weight  in 
the  first  place.  Christ  listens  in  silence.  Then,  as  the  Inquisitor  turns  to  leave, 
Christ  embraces  him,  and  kisses  him  on  the  lips.  The  Inquisitor  turns  white,  in 
shock.  Then  he  goes  out,  leaving  the  cell  door  open. 


The  profundity  of  this  story  and  the  greatness  of  spirit  necessary  to  produce  it 
can  hardly  be  exaggerated.  Dostoevsky,  one  of  the  great  literary  geniuses  of  all 
time,  confronted  the  most  serious  existential  problems  in  all  his  great  writings, 
and  he  did  so  courageously,  headlong,  and  heedless  of  the  consequences.  Clearly 
Christian,  he  nonetheless  adamantly  refuses  to  make  a  straw  man  of  his 
rationalist  and  atheistic  opponents.  Quite  the  contrary:  In  The  Brothers 
Karamazov,  for  example,  Dostoevsky’s  atheist,  Ivan,  argues  against  the 
presuppositions  of  Christianity  with  unsurpassable  clarity  and  passion.  Alyosha, 
aligned  with  the  Church  by  temperament  and  decision,  cannot  undermine  a 
single  one  of  his  brother’s  arguments  (although  his  faith  remains  unshakeable). 
Dostoevsky  knew  and  admitted  that  Christianity  had  been  defeated  by  the 
rational  faculty — by  the  intellect,  even — but  (and  this  is  of  primary  importance) 
he  did  not  hide  from  that  fact.  He  didn’t  attempt  through  denial  or  deceit  or  even 
satire  to  weaken  the  position  that  opposed  what  he  believed  to  be  most  true  and 
valuable.  He  instead  placed  action  above  words,  and  addressed  the  problem 
successfully.  By  the  novel’s  end,  Dostoevsky  has  the  great  embodied  moral 
goodness  of  Alyosha — the  novitiate’s  courageous  imitation  of  Christ — attain 
victory  over  the  spectacular  but  ultimately  nihilistic  critical  intelligence  of  Ivan. 

The  Christian  church  described  by  the  Grand  Inquisitor  is  the  same  church 
pilloried  by  Nietzsche.  Childish,  sanctimonious,  patriarchal,  servant  of  the  state, 
that  church  is  everything  rotten  still  objected  to  by  modern  critics  of  Christianity. 
Nietzsche,  for  all  his  brilliance,  allows  himself  anger,  but  does  not  perhaps 
sufficiently  temper  it  with  judgement.  This  is  where  Dostoevsky  truly  transcends 
Nietzsche,  in  my  estimation — where  Dostoevsky’s  great  literature  transcends 
Nietzsche’s  mere  philosophy.  The  Russian  writer’s  Inquisitor  is  the  genuine 
article,  in  every  sense.  He  is  an  opportunistic,  cynical,  manipulative  and  cruel 
interrogator,  willing  to  persecute  heretics — even  to  torture  and  kill  them.  He  is 
the  purveyor  of  a  dogma  he  knows  to  be  false.  But  Dostoevsky  has  Christ,  the 
archetypal  perfect  man,  kiss  him  anyway.  Equally  importantly,  in  the  aftermath 
of  the  kiss,  the  Grand  Inquisitor  leaves  the  door  ajar  so  Christ  can  escape  his 
pending  execution.  Dostoevsky  saw  that  the  great,  corrupt  edifice  of  Christianity 
still  managed  to  make  room  for  the  spirit  of  its  Founder.  That’s  the  gratitude  of  a 
wise  and  profound  soul  for  the  enduring  wisdom  of  the  West,  despite  its  faults. 

It’s  not  as  if  Nietzsche  was  unwilling  to  give  the  faith — and,  more  particularly, 
Catholicism — its  due.  Nietzsche  believed  that  the  long  tradition  of  “unfreedom” 
characterizing  dogmatic  Christianity — its  insistence  that  everything  be  explained 
within  the  confines  of  a  single,  coherent  metaphysical  theory — was  a  necessary 
precondition  for  the  emergence  of  the  disciplined  but  free  modern  mind.  As  he 
stated  in  Beyond  Good  and  Evil: 


The  long  bondage  of  the  spirit  . . .  the  persistent  spiritual  will  to  interpret  everything  that 
happened  according  to  a  Christian  scheme,  and  in  every  occurrence  to  rediscover  and  justify  the 
Christian  God  in  every  accident: — all  this  violence,  arbitrariness,  severity,  dreadfulness,  and 
unreasonableness,  has  proved  itself  the  disciplinary  means  whereby  the  European  spirit  has 
attained  its  strength,  its  remorseless  curiosity  and  subtle  mobility;  granted  also  that  much 

irrecoverable  strength  and  spirit  had  to  be  stifled,  suffocated  and  spoiled  in  the  process. 

For  Nietzsche  and  Dostoevsky  alike,  freedom — even  the  ability  to  act — requires 
constraint.  For  this  reason,  they  both  recognized  the  vital  necessity  of  the  dogma 
of  the  Church.  The  individual  must  be  constrained,  moulded — even  brought 
close  to  destruction — by  a  restrictive,  coherent  disciplinary  structure,  before  he 
or  she  can  act  freely  and  competently.  Dostoevsky,  with  his  great  generosity  of 
spirit,  granted  to  the  church,  corrupt  as  it  might  be,  a  certain  element  of  mercy,  a 
certain  pragmatism.  He  admitted  that  the  spirit  of  Christ,  the  world-engendering 
Logos,  had  historically  and  might  still  find  its  resting  place — even  its 
sovereignty — within  that  dogmatic  structure. 

If  a  father  disciplines  his  son  properly,  he  obviously  interferes  with  his 
freedom,  particularly  in  the  here-and-now.  He  put  limits  on  the  voluntary 
expression  of  his  son’s  Being,  forcing  him  to  take  his  place  as  a  socialized 
member  of  the  world.  Such  a  father  requires  that  all  that  childish  potential  be 
funneled  down  a  singly  pathway.  In  placing  such  limitations  on  his  son,  he  might 
be  considered  a  destructive  force,  acting  as  he  does  to  replace  the  miraculous 
plurality  of  childhood  with  a  single  narrow  actuality.  But  if  the  father  does  not 
take  such  action,  he  merely  lets  his  son  remain  Peter  Pan,  the  eternal  Boy,  King 
of  the  Lost  Boys,  Ruler  of  the  non-existent  Neverland.  That  is  not  a  morally 
acceptable  alternative. 

The  dogma  of  the  Church  was  undermined  by  the  spirit  of  truth  strongly 
developed  by  the  Church  itself.  That  undermining  culminated  in  the  death  of 
God.  But  the  dogmatic  structure  of  the  Church  was  a  necessary  disciplinary 
structure.  A  long  period  of  unfreedom — adherence  to  a  singular  interpretive 
structure — is  necessary  for  the  development  of  a  free  mind.  Christian  dogma 
provided  that  unfreedom.  But  the  dogma  is  dead,  at  least  to  the  modern  Western 
mind.  It  perished  along  with  God.  What  has  emerged  from  behind  its  corpse, 
however — and  this  is  an  issue  of  central  importance — is  something  even  more 
dead;  something  that  was  never  alive,  even  in  the  past:  nihilism,  as  well  as  an 
equally  dangerous  susceptibility  to  new,  totalizing,  utopian  ideas.  It  was  in  the 
aftermath  of  God’s  death  that  the  great  collective  horrors  of  Communism  and 
Fascism  sprang  forth  (as  both  Dostoevsky  and  Nietzsche  predicted  they  would). 
Nietzsche,  for  his  part,  posited  that  individual  human  beings  would  have  to 
invent  their  own  values  in  the  aftermath  of  God’s  death.  But  this  is  the  element 


of  his  thinking  that  appears  weakest,  psychologically:  we  cannot  invent  our  own 
values,  because  we  cannot  merely  impose  what  we  believe  on  our  souls.  This 
was  Carl  Jung’s  great  discovery — made  in  no  little  part  because  of  his  intense 
study  of  the  problems  posed  by  Nietzsche. 

We  rebel  against  our  own  totalitarianism,  as  much  as  that  of  others.  I  cannot 
merely  order  myself  to  action,  and  neither  can  you.  “I  will  stop  procrastinating,” 

I  say,  but  I  don’t.  “I  will  eat  properly,”  I  say,  but  I  don’t.  “I  will  end  my  drunken 
misbehavior,”  I  say,  but  I  don’t.  I  cannot  merely  make  myself  over  in  the  image 
constructed  by  my  intellect  (particularly  if  that  intellect  is  possessed  by  an 
ideology).  I  have  a  nature,  and  so  do  you,  and  so  do  we  all.  We  must  discover 
that  nature,  and  contend  with  it,  before  making  peace  with  ourselves.  What  is  it, 
that  we  most  truly  are?  What  is  it  that  we  could  most  truly  become,  knowing 
who  we  most  truly  are?  We  must  get  to  the  very  bottom  of  things  before  such 
questions  can  be  truly  answered. 

Doubt,  Past  Mere  Nihilism 

Three  hundred  years  before  Nietzsche,  the  great  French  philosopher  Rene 
Descartes  set  out  on  an  intellectual  mission  to  take  his  doubt  seriously,  to  break 
things  apart,  to  get  to  what  was  essential — to  see  if  he  could  establish,  or 
discover,  a  single  proposition  impervious  to  his  skepticism.  He  was  searching  for 
the  foundation  stone  on  which  proper  Being  could  be  established.  Descartes 
found  it,  as  far  as  he  was  concerned,  in  the  “I”  who  thinks — the  “I”  who  was 
aware — as  expressed  in  his  famous  dictum,  cogito  ergo  sum  (I  think,  therefore  I 
am).  But  that  “I”  had  been  conceptualized  long  before.  Thousands  of  years  ago, 
the  aware  “I”  was  the  all-seeing  eye  of  Horus,  the  great  Egyptian  son-and-sun- 
god,  who  renewed  the  state  by  attending  to  and  then  confronting  its  inevitable 
corruption.  Before  that,  it  was  the  creator-God  Marduk  of  the  Mesopotamians, 
whose  eyes  encircled  his  head  and  who  spoke  forth  words  of  world-engendering 
magic.  During  the  Christian  epoch,  the  “I”  transformed  into  the  Logos,  the  Word 
that  speaks  order  into  Being  at  the  beginning  of  time.  It  might  be  said  that 
Descartes  merely  secularized  the  Logos,  turning  it,  more  explicitly,  into  “that 
which  is  aware  and  thinks.”  That’s  the  modern  self,  simply  put.  But  what  exactly 
is  that  self? 

We  can  understand,  to  some  degree,  its  horrors,  if  we  wish  to,  but  its  goodness 
remains  more  difficult  to  define.  The  self  is  the  great  actor  of  evil  who  strode 
about  the  stage  of  Being  as  Nazi  and  Stalinist  alike;  who  produced  Auschwitz, 
Buchenwald,  Dachau,  and  the  multiplicity  of  the  Soviet  gulags.  And  all  of  that 
must  be  considered  with  dread  seriousness.  But  what  is  its  opposite?  What  is  the 


good  that  is  the  necessary  counterpart  of  that  evil;  that  is  made  more  corporeal 
and  comprehensible  by  the  very  existence  of  that  evil?  And  here  we  can  state 
with  conviction  and  clarity  that  even  the  rational  intellect — that  faculty  so 
beloved  of  those  who  hold  traditional  wisdom  in  contempt — is  at  minimum 
something  closely  and  necessarily  akin  to  the  archetypal  dying  and  eternally 
resurrected  god,  the  eternal  savior  of  humanity,  the  Logos  itself.  The  philosopher 
of  science  Karl  Popper,  certainly  no  mystic,  regarded  thinking  itself  as  a  logical 
extension  of  the  Darwinian  process.  A  creature  that  cannot  think  must  solely 
embody  its  Being.  It  can  merely  act  out  its  nature,  concretely,  in  the  here-and- 
now.  If  it  cannot  manifest  in  its  behavior  what  the  environment  demands  while 
doing  so,  it  will  simply  die.  But  that  is  not  true  of  human  beings.  We  can  produce 
abstracted  representations  of  potential  modes  of  Being.  We  can  produce  an  idea 
in  the  theatre  of  the  imagination.  We  can  test  it  out  against  our  other  ideas,  the 
ideas  of  others,  or  the  world  itself.  If  it  falls  short,  we  can  let  it  go.  We  can,  in 
Popper’s  formulation,  let  our  ideas  die  in  our  stead.  Then  the  essential  part, 
the  creator  of  those  ideas,  can  continue  onward,  now  untrammeled,  by 
comparison,  with  error.  Faith  in  the  part  of  us  that  continues  across  those  deaths 
is  a  prerequisite  to  thinking  itself. 

Now,  an  idea  is  not  the  same  thing  as  a  fact.  A  fact  is  something  that  is  dead, 
in  and  of  itself.  It  has  no  consciousness,  no  will  to  power,  no  motivation,  no 
action.  There  are  billions  of  dead  facts.  The  internet  is  a  graveyard  of  dead  facts. 
But  an  idea  that  grips  a  person  is  alive.  It  wants  to  express  itself,  to  live  in  the 
world.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the  depth  psychologists — Freud  and  Jung 
paramount  among  them — insisted  that  the  human  psyche  was  a  battleground  for 
ideas.  An  idea  has  an  aim.  It  wants  something.  It  posits  a  value  structure.  An 
idea  believes  that  what  it  is  aiming  for  is  better  than  what  it  has  now.  It  reduces 
the  world  to  those  things  that  aid  or  impede  its  realization,  and  it  reduces 
everything  else  to  irrelevance.  An  idea  defines  figure  against  ground.  An  idea  is 
a  personality,  not  a  fact.  When  it  manifests  itself  within  a  person,  it  has  a  strong 
proclivity  to  make  of  that  person  its  avatar:  to  impel  that  person  to  act  it  out. 
Sometimes,  that  impulsion  (possession  is  another  word)  can  be  so  strong  that  the 
person  will  die,  rather  than  allowing  the  idea  to  perish.  This  is,  generally 
speaking,  a  bad  decision,  given  that  it  is  often  the  case  that  only  the  idea  need 
die,  and  that  the  person  with  the  idea  can  stop  being  its  avatar,  change  his  or  her 
ways,  and  continue. 

To  use  the  dramatic  conceptualization  of  our  ancestors:  It  is  the  most 
fundamental  convictions  that  must  die — must  be  sacrificed — when  the 
relationship  with  God  has  been  disrupted  (when  the  presence  of  undue  and  often 
intolerable  suffering,  for  example,  indicates  that  something  has  to  change).  This 


is  to  say  nothing  other  than  that  the  future  can  be  made  better  if  the  proper 
sacrifices  take  place  in  the  present.  No  other  animal  has  ever  figured  this  out, 
and  it  took  us  untold  hundreds  of  thousands  of  years  to  do  it.  It  took  further  eons 
of  observation  and  hero-worship,  and  then  millennia  of  study,  to  distill  that  idea 
into  a  story.  It  then  took  additional  vast  stretches  of  time  to  assess  that  story,  to 
incorporate  it,  so  that  we  now  can  simply  say,  “If  you  are  disciplined  and 
privilege  the  future  over  the  present  you  can  change  the  structure  of  reality  in 
your  favour.” 

But  how  best  to  do  that? 

In  1984, 1  started  down  the  same  road  as  Descartes.  I  did  not  know  it  was  the 
same  road  at  the  time,  and  I  am  not  claiming  kinship  with  Descartes,  who  is 
rightly  regarded  as  one  of  the  greatest  philosophers  of  all  time.  But  I  was  truly 
plagued  with  doubt.  I  had  outgrown  the  shallow  Christianity  of  my  youth  by  the 
time  I  could  understand  the  fundamentals  of  Darwinian  theory.  After  that,  I 
could  not  distinguish  the  basic  elements  of  Christian  belief  from  wishful 
thinking.  The  socialism  that  soon  afterward  became  so  attractive  to  me  as  an 
alternative  proved  equally  insubstantial;  with  time,  I  came  to  understand, 
through  the  great  George  Orwell,  that  much  of  such  thinking  found  its 
motivation  in  hatred  of  the  rich  and  successful,  instead  of  true  regard  for  the 
poor.  Besides,  the  socialists  were  more  intrinsically  capitalist  than  the  capitalists. 
They  believed  just  as  strongly  in  money.  They  just  thought  that  if  different 
people  had  the  money,  the  problems  plaguing  humanity  would  vanish.  This  is 
simply  untrue.  There  are  many  problems  that  money  does  not  solve,  and  others 
that  it  makes  worse.  Rich  people  still  divorce  each  other,  and  alienate  themselves 
from  their  children,  and  suffer  from  existential  angst,  and  develop  cancer  and 
dementia,  and  die  alone  and  unloved.  Recovering  addicts  cursed  with  money 
blow  it  all  in  a  frenzy  of  snorting  and  drunkenness.  And  boredom  weighs  heavily 
on  people  who  have  nothing  to  do. 

I  was  simultaneously  tormented  by  the  fact  of  the  Cold  War.  It  obsessed  me.  It 
gave  me  nightmares.  It  drove  me  into  the  desert,  into  the  long  night  of  the  human 
soul.  I  could  not  understand  how  it  had  come  to  pass  that  the  world’s  two  great 
factions  aimed  mutual  assured  destruction  at  each  other.  Was  one  system  just  as 
arbitrary  and  corrupt  as  the  other?  Was  it  a  mere  matter  of  opinion?  Were  all 
value  structures  merely  the  clothing  of  power? 

Was  everyone  crazy? 

Just  exactly  what  happened  in  the  twentieth  century,  anyway?  How  was  it  that 
so  many  tens  of  millions  had  to  die,  sacrificed  to  the  new  dogmas  and 
ideologies?  How  was  it  that  we  discovered  something  worse,  much  worse,  than 
the  aristocracy  and  corrupt  religious  beliefs  that  communism  and  fascism  sought 


so  rationally  to  supplant?  No  one  had  answered  those  questions,  as  far  as  I  could 
tell.  Like  Descartes,  I  was  plagued  with  doubt.  I  searched  for  one  thing — 
anything — I  could  regard  as  indisputable.  I  wanted  a  rock  upon  which  to  build 
my  house.  It  was  doubt  that  led  me  to  it. 

I  once  read  of  a  particularly  insidious  practice  at  Auschwitz.  A  guard  would 
force  an  inmate  to  carry  a  hundred-pound  sack  of  wet  salt  from  one  side  of  the 
large  compound  to  the  other — and  then  to  carry  it  back.  Arbeit  macht  frei,  said 
the  sign  over  the  camp  entrance — “Work  will  set  you  free” — and  the  freedom 
was  death.  Carrying  the  salt  was  an  act  of  pointless  torment.  It  was  a  piece  of 
malevolent  art.  It  allowed  me  to  realize  with  certainty  that  some  actions  are 
wrong. 

Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn  wrote,  definitively  and  profoundly,  about  the  horrors 
of  the  twentieth  century,  the  tens  of  millions  who  were  stripped  of  employment, 
family,  identity  and  life.  In  his  Gulag  Archipelago,  in  the  second  part  of  the 
second  volume,  he  discussed  the  Nuremburg  trials,  which  he  considered  the  most 
significant  event  of  the  twentieth  century.  The  conclusion  of  those  trials?  There 
are  some  actions  that  are  so  intrinsically  terrible  that  they  run  counter  to  the 
proper  nature  of  human  Being.  This  is  true  essentially,  cross-culturally — across 
time  and  place.  These  are  evil  actions.  No  excuses  are  available  for  engaging  in 
them.  To  dehumanize  a  fellow  being,  to  reduce  him  or  her  to  the  status  of  a 
parasite,  to  torture  and  to  slaughter  with  no  consideration  of  individual 
innocence  or  guilt,  to  make  an  art  form  of  pain — that  is  wrong. 

What  can  I  not  doubt?  The  reality  of  suffering.  It  brooks  no  arguments. 
Nihilists  cannot  undermine  it  with  skepticism.  Totalitarians  cannot  banish  it. 
Cynics  cannot  escape  from  its  reality.  Suffering  is  real,  and  the  artful  infliction  of 
suffering  on  another,  for  its  own  sake,  is  wrong.  That  became  the  cornerstone  of 
my  belief.  Searching  through  the  lowest  reaches  of  human  thought  and  action, 
understanding  my  own  capacity  to  act  like  a  Nazi  prison  guard  or  a  gulag 
archipelago  trustee  or  a  torturer  of  children  in  a  dungeon,  I  grasped  what  it 
meant  to  “take  the  sins  of  the  world  onto  oneself.”  Each  human  being  has  an 
immense  capacity  for  evil.  Each  human  being  understands,  a  priori,  perhaps  not 
what  is  good,  but  certainly  what  is  not.  And  if  there  is  something  that  is  not 
good,  then  there  is  something  that  is  good.  If  the  worst  sin  is  the  torment  of 
others,  merely  for  the  sake  of  the  suffering  produced — then  the  good  is  whatever 
is  diametrically  opposed  to  that.  The  good  is  whatever  stops  such  things  from 
happening. 


Meaning  as  the  Higher  Good 


It  was  from  this  that  I  drew  my  fundamental  moral  conclusions.  Aim  up.  Pay 
attention.  Fix  what  you  can  fix.  Don’t  be  arrogant  in  your  knowledge.  Strive  for 
humility,  because  totalitarian  pride  manifests  itself  in  intolerance,  oppression, 
torture  and  death.  Become  aware  of  your  own  insufficiency — your  cowardice, 
malevolence,  resentment  and  hatred.  Consider  the  murderousness  of  your  own 
spirit  before  you  dare  accuse  others,  and  before  you  attempt  to  repair  the  fabric 
of  the  world.  Maybe  it’s  not  the  world  that’s  at  fault.  Maybe  it’s  you.  You’ve 
failed  to  make  the  mark.  You’ve  missed  the  target.  You’ve  fallen  short  of  the 
glory  of  God.  You’ve  sinned.  And  all  of  that  is  your  contribution  to  the 
insufficiency  and  evil  of  the  world.  And,  above  all,  don’t  lie.  Don’t  lie  about 
anything,  ever.  Lying  leads  to  Hell.  It  was  the  great  and  the  small  lies  of  the  Nazi 
and  Communist  states  that  produced  the  deaths  of  millions  of  people. 

Consider  then  that  the  alleviation  of  unnecessary  pain  and  suffering  is  a  good. 
Make  that  an  axiom:  to  the  best  of  my  ability  I  will  act  in  a  manner  that  leads  to 
the  alleviation  of  unnecessary  pain  and  suffering.  You  have  now  placed  at  the 
pinnacle  of  your  moral  hierarchy  a  set  of  presuppositions  and  actions  aimed  at 
the  betterment  of  Being.  Why?  Because  we  know  the  alternative.  The  alternative 
was  the  twentieth  century.  The  alternative  was  so  close  to  Hell  that  the  difference 
is  not  worth  discussing.  And  the  opposite  of  Hell  is  Heaven.  To  place  the 
alleviation  of  unnecessary  pain  and  suffering  at  the  pinnacle  of  your  hierarchy  of 
value  is  to  work  to  bring  about  the  Kingdom  of  God  on  Earth.  That’s  a  state,  and 
a  state  of  mind,  at  the  same  time. 

Jung  observed  that  the  construction  of  such  a  moral  hierarchy  was  inevitable 
— although  it  could  remain  poorly  arranged  and  internally  self-contradictory.  For 
Jung,  whatever  was  at  the  top  of  an  individual’s  moral  hierarchy  was,  for  all 
intents  and  purposes,  that  person’s  ultimate  value,  that  person’s  god.  It  was  what 
the  person  acted  out.  It  was  what  the  person  believed  most  deeply.  Something 
enacted  is  not  a  fact,  or  even  a  set  of  facts.  Instead,  it’s  a  personality — or,  more 
precisely,  a  choice  between  two  opposing  personalities.  It’s  Sherlock  Holmes  or 
Moriarty.  It’s  Batman  or  the  Joker.  It’s  Superman  or  Lex  Luthor,  Charles  Francis 
Xavier  or  Magneto,  and  Thor  or  Loki.  It’s  Abel  or  Cain — and  it’s  Christ  or 
Satan.  If  it’s  working  for  the  ennobling  of  Being,  for  the  establishment  of 
Paradise,  then  it’s  Christ.  If  it’s  working  for  the  destruction  of  Being,  for  the 
generation  and  propagation  of  unnecessary  suffering  and  pain,  then  it’s  Satan. 
That’s  the  inescapable,  archetypal  reality. 

Expedience  is  the  following  of  blind  impulse.  It’s  short-term  gain.  It’s  narrow, 
and  selfish.  It  lies  to  get  its  way.  It  takes  nothing  into  account.  It’s  immature  and 
irresponsible.  Meaning  is  its  mature  replacement.  Meaning  emerges  when 
impulses  are  regulated,  organized  and  unified.  Meaning  emerges  from  the 


interplay  between  the  possibilities  of  the  world  and  the  value  structure  operating 
within  that  world.  If  the  value  structure  is  aimed  at  the  betterment  of  Being,  the 
meaning  revealed  will  be  life-sustaining.  It  will  provide  the  antidote  for  chaos 
and  suffering.  It  will  make  everything  matter.  It  will  make  everything  better. 

If  you  act  properly,  your  actions  allow  you  to  be  psychologically  integrated 
now,  and  tomorrow,  and  into  the  future,  while  you  benefit  yourself,  your  family, 
and  the  broader  world  around  you.  Everything  will  stack  up  and  align  along  a 
single  axis.  Everything  will  come  together.  This  produces  maximal  meaning. 
This  stacking  up  is  a  place  in  space  and  time  whose  existence  we  can  detect  with 
our  ability  to  experience  more  than  is  simply  revealed  here  and  now  by  our 
senses,  which  are  obviously  limited  to  their  information-gathering  and 
representational  capacity.  Meaning  trumps  expedience.  Meaning  gratifies  all 
impulses,  now  and  forever.  That’s  why  we  can  detect  it. 

If  you  decide  that  you  are  not  justified  in  your  resentment  of  Being,  despite  its 
inequity  and  pain,  you  may  come  to  notice  things  you  could  fix  to  reduce  even 
by  a  bit  some  unnecessary  pain  and  suffering.  You  may  come  to  ask  yourself, 
“What  should  I  do  today?”  in  a  manner  that  means  “How  could  I  use  my  time  to 
make  things  better,  instead  of  worse?”  Such  tasks  may  announce  themselves  as 
the  pile  of  undone  paperwork  that  you  could  attend  to,  the  room  that  you  could 
make  a  bit  more  welcoming,  or  the  meal  that  could  be  a  bit  more  delicious  and 
more  gratefully  delivered  to  your  family. 

You  may  find  that  if  you  attend  to  these  moral  obligations,  once  you  have 
placed  “make  the  world  better”  at  the  top  of  your  value  hierarchy,  you 
experience  ever-deepening  meaning.  It’s  not  bliss.  It’s  not  happiness.  It  is 
something  more  like  atonement  for  the  criminal  fact  of  your  fractured  and 
damaged  Being.  It’s  payment  of  the  debt  you  owe  for  the  insane  and  horrible 
miracle  of  your  existence.  It’s  how  you  remember  the  Holocaust.  It’s  how  you 
make  amends  for  the  pathology  of  history.  It’s  adoption  of  the  responsibility  for 
being  a  potential  denizen  of  Hell.  It  is  willingness  to  serve  as  an  angel  of 
Paradise. 

Expedience — that’s  hiding  all  the  skeletons  in  the  closet.  That’s  covering  the 
blood  you  just  spilled  with  a  carpet.  That’s  avoiding  responsibility.  It’s  cowardly, 
and  shallow,  and  wrong.  It’s  wrong  because  mere  expedience,  multiplied  by 
many  repetitions,  produces  the  character  of  a  demon.  It’s  wrong  because 
expedience  merely  transfers  the  curse  on  your  head  to  someone  else,  or  to  your 
future  self,  in  a  manner  that  will  make  your  future,  and  the  future  generally, 
worse  instead  of  better. 

There  is  no  faith  and  no  courage  and  no  sacrifice  in  doing  what  is  expedient. 
There  is  no  careful  observation  that  actions  and  presuppositions  matter,  or  that 


the  world  is  made  of  what  matters.  To  have  meaning  in  your  life  is  better  than  to 
have  what  you  want,  because  you  may  neither  know  what  you  want,  nor  what 
you  truly  need.  Meaning  is  something  that  comes  upon  you,  of  its  own  accord. 
You  can  set  up  the  preconditions,  you  can  follow  meaning,  when  it  manifests 
itself,  but  you  cannot  simply  produce  it,  as  an  act  of  will.  Meaning  signifies  that 
you  are  in  the  right  place,  at  the  right  time,  properly  balanced  between  order  and 
chaos,  where  everything  lines  up  as  best  it  can  at  that  moment. 

What  is  expedient  works  only  for  the  moment.  It’s  immediate,  impulsive  and 
limited.  What  is  meaningful,  by  contrast,  is  the  organization  of  what  would 
otherwise  merely  be  expedient  into  a  symphony  of  Being.  Meaning  is  what  is  put 
forth  more  powerfully  than  mere  words  can  express  by  Beethoven’s  “Ode  to 
Joy,”  a  triumphant  bringing  forth  from  the  void  of  pattern  after  pattern  upon 
beautiful  pattern,  every  instrument  playing  its  part,  disciplined  voices  layered  on 
top  of  that,  spanning  the  entire  breadth  of  human  emotion  from  despair  to 
exhilaration. 

Meaning  is  what  manifests  itself  when  the  many  levels  of  Being  arrange 
themselves  into  a  perfectly  functioning  harmony,  from  atomic  microcosm  to  cell 
to  organ  to  individual  to  society  to  nature  to  cosmos,  so  that  action  at  each  level 
beautifully  and  perfectly  facilitates  action  at  all,  such  that  past,  present  and 
future  are  all  at  once  redeemed  and  reconciled.  Meaning  is  what  emerges 
beautifully  and  profoundly  like  a  newly  formed  rosebud  opening  itself  out  of 
nothingness  into  the  light  of  sun  and  God.  Meaning  is  the  lotus  striving  upward 
through  the  dark  lake  depths  through  the  ever-clearing  water,  blooming  forth  on 
the  very  surface,  revealing  within  itself  the  Golden  Buddha,  himself  perfectly 
integrated,  such  that  the  revelation  of  the  Divine  Will  can  make  itself  manifest  in 
his  every  word  and  gesture. 

Meaning  is  when  everything  there  is  comes  together  in  an  ecstatic  dance  of 
single  purpose — the  glorification  of  a  reality  so  that  no  matter  how  good  it  has 
suddenly  become,  it  can  get  better  and  better  and  better  more  and  more  deeply 
forever  into  the  future.  Meaning  happens  when  that  dance  has  become  so  intense 
that  all  the  horrors  of  the  past,  all  the  terrible  struggle  engaged  in  by  all  of  life 
and  all  of  humanity  to  that  moment  becomes  a  necessary  and  worthwhile  part  of 
the  increasingly  successful  attempt  to  build  something  truly  Mighty  and  Good. 

Meaning  is  the  ultimate  balance  between,  on  the  one  hand,  the  chaos  of 
transformation  and  possibility  and  on  the  other,  the  discipline  of  pristine  order, 
whose  purpose  is  to  produce  out  of  the  attendant  chaos  a  new  order  that  will  be 
even  more  immaculate,  and  capable  of  bringing  forth  a  still  more  balanced  and 
productive  chaos  and  order.  Meaning  is  the  Way,  the  path  of  life  more  abundant, 
the  place  you  live  when  you  are  guided  by  Love  and  speaking  Truth  and  when 


nothing  you  want  or  could  possibly  want  takes  any  precedence  over  precisely 
that. 

Do  what  is  meaningful,  not  what  is  expedient. 


RULE  8 


TELL  THE  TRUTH— OR,  AT  LEAST,  DON’T  LIE 

TRUTH  IN  NO-MAN’ S-L  AND 

I  trained  to  become  a  clinical  psychologist  at  McGill  University,  in  Montreal. 
While  doing  so,  I  sometimes  met  my  classmates  on  the  grounds  of  Montreal’s 
Douglas  Hospital,  where  we  had  our  first  direct  experiences  with  the  mentally 
ill.  The  Douglas  occupies  acres  of  land  and  dozens  of  buildings.  Many  are 
connected  by  underground  tunnels  to  protect  workers  and  patients  from  the 
interminable  Montreal  winters.  The  hospital  once  sheltered  hundreds  of  long¬ 
term  in-house  patients.  This  was  before  anti-psychotic  drugs  and  the  large  scale 
deinstitutionalization  movements  of  the  late  sixties  all  but  closed  down  the 
residential  asylums,  most  often  dooming  the  now  “freed”  patients  to  a  much 
harder  life  on  the  streets.  By  the  early  eighties,  when  I  first  visited  the  grounds, 
all  but  the  most  seriously  afflicted  residents  had  been  discharged.  Those  who 
remained  were  strange,  much-damaged  people.  They  clustered  around  the 
vending  machines  scattered  throughout  the  hospital’s  tunnels.  They  looked  as  if 
they  had  been  photographed  by  Diane  Arbus  or  painted  by  Hieronymus  Bosch. 

One  day  my  classmates  and  I  were  all  standing  in  line.  We  were  awaiting 
further  instruction  from  the  strait-laced  German  psychologist  who  ran  the 
Douglas  clinical  training  program.  A  long-term  inpatient,  fragile  and  vulnerable, 
approached  one  of  the  other  students,  a  sheltered,  conservative  young  woman. 
The  patient  spoke  to  her  in  a  friendly,  childlike  manner,  and  asked,  “Why  are 
you  all  standing  here?  What  are  you  doing?  Can  I  come  along  with  you?”  My 
classmate  turned  to  me  and  asked  uncertainly,  “What  should  I  say  to  her?”  She 
was  taken  aback,  just  as  I  was,  by  this  request  coming  from  someone  so  isolated 
and  hurt.  Neither  of  us  wanted  to  say  anything  that  might  be  construed  as  a 
rejection  or  reprimand. 

We  had  temporarily  entered  a  kind  of  no-man ’s-land,  in  which  society  offers 
no  ground  rules  or  guidance.  We  were  new  clinical  students,  unprepared  to  be 
confronted  on  the  grounds  of  a  mental  hospital  by  a  schizophrenic  patient  asking 
a  naive,  friendly  question  about  the  possibility  of  social  belonging.  The  natural 
conversational  give-and-take  between  people  attentive  to  contextual  cues  was 
not  happening  here,  either.  What  exactly  were  the  rules,  in  such  a  situation,  far 
outside  the  boundaries  of  normal  social  interaction?  What  exactly  were  the 
options? 


There  were  only  two,  as  far  as  I  could  quickly  surmise.  I  could  tell  the  patient 
a  story  designed  to  save  everyone’s  face,  or  I  could  answer  truthfully.  “We  can 
only  take  eight  people  in  our  group,”  would  have  fallen  into  the  first  category,  as 
would  have,  “We  are  just  leaving  the  hospital  now.”  Neither  of  these  answers 
would  have  bruised  any  feelings,  at  least  on  the  surface,  and  the  presence  of  the 
status  differences  that  divided  us  from  her  would  have  gone  unremarked.  But 
neither  answer  would  have  been  exactly  true.  So,  I  didn’t  offer  either. 

I  told  the  patient  as  simply  and  directly  as  I  could  that  we  were  new  students, 
training  to  be  psychologists,  and  that  she  couldn’t  join  us  for  that  reason.  The 
answer  highlighted  the  distinction  between  her  situation  and  ours,  making  the 
gap  between  us  greater  and  more  evident.  The  answer  was  harsher  than  a  well- 
crafted  white  lie.  But  I  already  had  an  inkling  that  untruth,  however  well-meant, 
can  produce  unintended  consequences.  She  looked  crestfallen,  and  hurt,  but  only 
for  a  moment.  Then  she  understood,  and  it  was  all  right.  That  was  just  how  it 
was. 

I  had  had  a  strange  set  of  experiences  a  few  years  before  embarking  upon  my 
clinical  training.  I  found  myself  subject  to  some  rather  violent  compulsions 
(none  acted  upon),  and  developed  the  conviction,  in  consequence,  that  I  really 
knew  rather  little  about  who  I  was  and  what  I  was  up  to.  So,  I  began  paying 
much  closer  attention  to  what  I  was  doing — and  saying.  The  experience  was 
disconcerting,  to  say  the  least.  I  soon  divided  myself  into  two  parts:  one  that 
spoke,  and  one,  more  detached,  that  paid  attention  and  judged.  I  soon  came  to 
realize  that  almost  everything  I  said  was  untrue.  I  had  motives  for  saying  these 
things:  I  wanted  to  win  arguments  and  gain  status  and  impress  people  and  get 
what  I  wanted.  I  was  using  language  to  bend  and  twist  the  world  into  delivering 
what  I  thought  was  necessary.  But  I  was  a  fake.  Realizing  this,  I  started  to 
practise  only  saying  things  that  the  internal  voice  would  not  object  to.  I  started  to 
practise  telling  the  truth — or,  at  least,  not  lying.  I  soon  learned  that  such  a  skill 
came  in  very  handy  when  I  didn’t  know  what  to  do.  What  should  you  do,  when 
you  don’t  know  what  to  do?  Tell  the  truth.  So,  that’s  what  I  did  my  first  day  at 
the  Douglas  Hospital. 

Later,  I  had  a  client  who  was  paranoid  and  dangerous.  Working  with  paranoid 
people  is  challenging.  They  believe  they  have  been  targeted  by  mysterious 
conspiratorial  forces,  working  malevolently  behind  the  scenes.  Paranoid  people 
are  hyper-alert  and  hyper-focused.  They  are  attending  to  non-verbal  cues  with  an 
intentness  never  manifest  during  ordinary  human  interactions.  They  make 
mistakes  in  interpretation  (that’s  the  paranoia)  but  they  are  still  almost  uncanny 
in  their  ability  to  detect  mixed  motives,  judgment  and  falsehood.  You  have  to 


listen  very  carefully  and  tell  the  truth  if  you  are  going  to  get  a  paranoid  person  to 
open  up  to  you. 

I  listened  carefully  and  spoke  truthfully  to  my  client.  Now  and  then,  he  would 
describe  blood-curdling  fantasies  of  flaying  people  for  revenge.  I  would  watch 
how  I  was  reacting.  I  paid  attention  to  what  thoughts  and  images  emerged  in  the 
theatre  of  my  imagination  while  he  spoke,  and  I  told  him  what  I  observed.  I  was 
not  trying  to  control  or  direct  his  thoughts  or  actions  (or  mine).  I  was  only  trying 
to  let  him  know  as  transparently  as  I  could  how  what  he  was  doing  was  directly 
affecting  at  least  one  person — me.  My  careful  attention  and  frank  responses  did 
not  mean  at  all  that  I  remained  unperturbed,  let  alone  approved.  I  told  him  when 
he  scared  me  (often),  that  his  words  and  behaviour  were  misguided,  and  that  he 
was  going  to  get  into  serious  trouble. 

He  talked  to  me,  nonetheless,  because  I  listened  and  responded  honestly,  even 
though  I  was  not  encouraging  in  my  responses.  He  trusted  me,  despite  (or,  more 
accurately,  because  of)  my  objections.  He  was  paranoid,  not  stupid.  He  knew  his 
behaviour  was  socially  unacceptable.  He  knew  that  any  decent  person  was  likely 
to  react  with  horror  to  his  insane  fantasies.  He  trusted  me  and  would  talk  to  me 
because  that’s  how  I  reacted.  There  was  no  chance  of  understanding  him  without 
that  trust. 

Trouble  for  him  generally  started  in  a  bureaucracy,  such  as  a  bank.  He  would 
enter  an  institution  and  attempt  some  simple  task.  He  was  looking  to  open  an 
account,  or  pay  a  bill,  or  fix  some  mistake.  Now  and  then  he  encountered  the 
kind  of  non-helpful  person  that  everyone  encounters  now  and  then  in  such  a 
place.  That  person  would  reject  the  ID  he  offered,  or  require  some  information 
that  was  unnecessary  and  difficult  to  obtain.  Sometimes,  I  suppose,  the 
bureaucratic  runaround  was  unavoidable — but  sometimes  it  was  unnecessarily 
complicated  by  petty  misuses  of  bureaucratic  power.  My  client  was  very  attuned 
to  such  things.  He  was  obsessed  with  honour.  It  was  more  important  to  him  than 
safety,  freedom  or  belonging.  Following  that  logic  (because  paranoid  people  are 
impeccably  logical),  he  could  never  allow  himself  to  be  demeaned,  insulted  or 
put  down,  even  a  little  bit,  by  anyone.  Water  did  not  roll  off  his  back.  Because  of 
his  rigid  and  inflexible  attitude,  my  client’s  actions  had  already  been  subjected  to 
several  restraining  orders.  Restraining  orders  work  best,  however,  with  the  sort 
of  person  who  would  never  require  a  restraining  order. 

“I  will  be  your  worst  nightmare,”  was  his  phrase  of  choice,  in  such  situations. 

I  have  wished  intensely  that  I  could  say  something  like  that,  after  encountering 
unnecessary  bureaucratic  obstacles,  but  it’s  generally  best  to  let  such  things  go. 
My  client  meant  what  he  said,  however,  and  sometimes  he  really  did  become 
someone’s  nightmare.  He  was  the  bad  guy  in  No  Country  for  Old  Men.  He  was 


the  person  you  meet  in  the  wrong  place,  at  the  wrong  time.  If  you  messed  with 
him,  even  accidentally,  he  was  going  to  stalk  you,  remind  you  what  you  had 
done,  and  scare  the  living  daylights  out  of  you.  He  was  no  one  to  lie  to.  I  told 
him  the  truth  and  that  cooled  him  off. 

My  Landlord 

I  had  a  landlord  around  that  time  who  had  been  president  of  a  local  biker  gang. 
My  wife,  Tammy,  and  I  lived  next  door  to  him  in  his  parents’  small  apartment 
building.  His  girlfriend  bore  the  marks  of  self-inflicted  injuries  characteristic  of 
borderline  personality  disorder.  She  killed  herself  while  we  lived  there. 

Denis,  large,  strong,  French-Canadian,  with  a  grey  beard,  was  a  gifted  amateur 
electrician.  He  had  some  artistic  talent,  too,  and  was  supporting  himself  making 
laminated  wood  posters  with  custom  neon  lights.  He  was  trying  to  stay  sober, 
after  being  released  from  jail.  Still,  every  month  or  so,  he  would  disappear  on  a 
days-long  bender.  He  was  one  of  those  men  who  have  a  miraculous  capacity  for 
alcohol;  he  could  drink  fifty  or  sixty  beer  in  a  two-day  binge  and  remain 
standing  the  whole  time.  This  may  seem  hard  to  believe,  but  it’s  true.  I  was 
doing  research  on  familial  alcoholism  at  the  time,  and  it  was  not  rare  for  my 
subjects  to  report  their  fathers’  habitual  consumption  of  forty  ounces  of  vodka  a 
day.  These  patriarchs  would  buy  one  bottle  every  afternoon,  Monday  through 
Friday,  and  then  two  on  Saturday,  to  tide  them  over  through  the  Sunday  liquor- 
store  closure. 

Denis  had  a  little  dog.  Sometimes  Tammy  and  I  would  hear  Denis  and  the  dog 
out  in  the  backyard  at  four  in  the  morning,  during  one  of  Denis’s  marathon 
drinking  sessions,  both  of  them  howling  madly  at  the  moon.  Now  and  then,  on 
occasions  like  that,  Denis  would  drink  up  every  cent  he  had  saved.  Then  he 
would  show  up  at  our  apartment.  We  would  hear  a  knock  at  night.  Denis  would 
be  at  the  door,  swaying  precipitously,  upright,  and  miraculously  conscious. 

He  would  be  standing  there,  toaster,  microwave,  or  poster  in  hand.  He  wanted 
to  sell  these  to  me  so  he  could  keep  on  drinking.  I  bought  a  few  things  like  this, 
pretending  that  I  was  being  charitable.  Eventually,  Tammy  convinced  me  that  I 
couldn’t  do  it  anymore.  It  made  her  nervous,  and  it  was  bad  for  Denis,  whom  she 
liked.  Reasonable  and  even  necessary  as  her  request  was,  it  still  placed  me  in  a 
tricky  position. 

What  do  you  say  to  a  severely  intoxicated,  violence-prone  ex-biker-gang- 
president  with  patchy  English  when  he  tries  to  sell  his  microwave  to  you  at  your 
open  door  at  two  in  the  morning?  This  was  a  question  even  more  difficult  than 
those  presented  by  the  institutionalized  patient  or  the  paranoid  flayer.  But  the 


answer  was  the  same:  the  truth.  But  you’d  bloody  well  better  know  what  the 
truth  is. 

Denis  knocked  again  soon  after  my  wife  and  I  had  talked.  He  looked  at  me  in 
the  direct  skeptical  narrow-eyed  manner  characteristic  of  the  tough,  heavy¬ 
drinking  man  who  is  no  stranger  to  trouble.  That  look  means,  “Prove  your 
innocence.”  Weaving  slightly  back  and  forth,  he  asked — politely — if  I  might  be 
interested  in  purchasing  his  toaster.  I  rid  myself,  to  the  bottom  of  my  soul,  of 
primate-dominance  motivations  and  moral  superiority.  I  told  him  as  directly  and 
carefully  as  I  could  that  I  would  not.  I  was  playing  no  tricks.  In  that  moment  I 
wasn’t  an  educated,  anglophone,  fortunate,  upwardly-mobile  young  man.  He 
wasn’t  an  ex-con  Quebecois  biker  with  a  blood  alcohol  level  of  .24.  No,  we  were 
two  men  of  good  will  trying  to  help  each  other  out  in  our  common  struggle  to  do 
the  right  thing.  I  said  that  he  had  told  me  he  was  trying  to  quit  drinking.  I  said 
that  it  would  not  be  good  for  him  if  I  provided  him  with  more  money.  I  said  that 
he  made  Tammy,  whom  he  respected,  nervous  when  he  came  over  so  drunk  and 
so  late  and  tried  to  sell  me  things. 

He  glared  seriously  at  me  without  speaking  for  about  fifteen  seconds.  That 
was  plenty  long  enough.  He  was  watching,  I  knew,  for  any  micro-expression 
revealing  sarcasm,  deceit,  contempt  or  self-congratulation.  But  I  had  thought  it 
through,  carefully,  and  I  had  only  said  things  I  truly  meant.  I  had  chosen  my 
words,  carefully,  traversing  a  treacherous  swamp,  feeling  out  a  partially 
submerged  stone  path.  Denis  turned  and  left.  Not  only  that,  he  remembered  our 
conversation,  despite  his  state  of  professional-level  intoxication.  He  didn’t  try  to 
sell  me  anything  again.  Our  relationship,  which  was  quite  good,  given  the  great 
cultural  gaps  between  us,  became  even  more  solid. 

Taking  the  easy  way  out  or  telling  the  truth — those  are  not  merely  two 
different  choices.  They  are  different  pathways  through  life.  They  are  utterly 
different  ways  of  existing. 

Manipulate  the  World 

You  can  use  words  to  manipulate  the  world  into  delivering  what  you  want.  This 
is  what  it  means  to  “act  politically.”  This  is  spin.  It’s  the  specialty  of 
unscrupulous  marketers,  salesmen,  advertisers,  pickup  artists,  slogan-possessed 
Utopians  and  psychopaths.  It’s  the  speech  people  engage  in  when  they  attempt  to 
influence  and  manipulate  others.  It’s  what  university  students  do  when  they  write 
an  essay  to  please  the  professor,  instead  of  articulating  and  clarifying  their  own 
ideas.  It’s  what  everyone  does  when  they  want  something,  and  decide  to  falsify 
themselves  to  please  and  flatter.  It’s  scheming  and  sloganeering  and  propaganda. 


To  conduct  life  like  this  is  to  become  possessed  by  some  ill-formed  desire,  and 
then  to  craft  speech  and  action  in  a  manner  that  appears  likely,  rationally,  to 
bring  about  that  end.  Typical  calculated  ends  might  include  “to  impose  my 
ideological  beliefs,”  “to  prove  that  I  am  (or  was)  right,”  “to  appear  competent,” 
“to  ratchet  myself  up  the  dominance  hierarchy,”  “to  avoid  responsibility”  (or  its 
twin,  “to  garner  credit  for  others’  actions”),  “to  be  promoted,”  “to  attract  the 
lion’s  share  of  attention,”  “to  ensure  that  everyone  likes  me,”  “to  garner  the 
benefits  of  martyrdom,”  “to  justify  my  cynicism,”  “to  rationalize  my  antisocial 
outlook,”  “to  minimize  immediate  conflict,”  “to  maintain  my  naivete,”  “to 
capitalize  on  my  vulnerability,”  “to  always  appear  as  the  sainted  one,”  or  (this 
one  is  particularly  evil)  “to  ensure  that  it  is  always  my  unloved  child’s  fault.” 
These  are  all  examples  of  what  Sigmund  Freud’s  compatriot,  the  lesser-known 
Austrian  psychologist  Alfred  Adler,  called  “life-lies.” 

Someone  living  a  life-lie  is  attempting  to  manipulate  reality  with  perception, 
thought  and  action,  so  that  only  some  narrowly  desired  and  pre-defined  outcome 
is  allowed  to  exist.  A  life  lived  in  this  manner  is  based,  consciously  or 
unconsciously,  on  two  premises.  The  first  is  that  current  knowledge  is  sufficient 
to  define  what  is  good,  unquestioningly,  far  into  the  future.  The  second  is  that 
reality  would  be  unbearable  if  left  to  its  own  devices.  The  first  presumption  is 
philosophically  unjustifiable.  What  you  are  currently  aiming  at  might  not  be 
worth  attaining,  just  as  what  you  are  currently  doing  might  be  an  error.  The 
second  is  even  worse.  It  is  valid  only  if  reality  is  intrinsically  intolerable  and, 
simultaneously,  something  that  can  be  successfully  manipulated  and  distorted. 
Such  speaking  and  thinking  requires  the  arrogance  and  certainty  that  the  English 
poet  John  Milton’s  genius  identified  with  Satan,  God’s  highest  angel  gone  most 
spectacularly  wrong.  The  faculty  of  rationality  inclines  dangerously  to  pride:  all 
I  know  is  all  that  needs  to  be  known.  Pride  falls  in  love  with  its  own  creations, 
and  tries  to  make  them  absolute. 

I  have  seen  people  define  their  utopia  and  then  bend  their  lives  into  knots 
trying  to  make  it  reality.  A  left-leaning  student  adopts  a  trendy,  anti-authority 
stance  and  spends  the  next  twenty  years  working  resentfully  to  topple  the 
windmills  of  his  imagination.  An  eighteen-year-old  decides,  arbitrarily,  that  she 
wants  to  retire  at  fifty-two.  She  works  for  three  decades  to  make  that  happen, 
failing  to  notice  that  she  made  that  decision  when  she  was  little  more  than  a 
child.  What  did  she  know  about  her  fifty-two-year-old  self,  when  still  a 
teenager?  Even  now,  many  years  later,  she  has  only  the  vaguest,  lowest- 
resolution  idea  of  her  post-work  Eden.  She  refuses  to  notice.  What  did  her  life 
mean,  if  that  initial  goal  was  wrong?  She’s  afraid  of  opening  Pandora’s  box, 


where  all  the  troubles  of  the  world  reside.  But  hope  is  in  there,  too.  Instead,  she 
warps  her  life  to  fit  the  fantasies  of  a  sheltered  adolescent. 

A  naively  formulated  goal  transmutes,  with  time,  into  the  sinister  form  of  the 
life-lie.  One  forty-something  client  told  me  his  vision,  formulated  by  his  younger 
self:  “I  see  myself  retired,  sitting  on  a  tropical  beach,  drinking  margaritas  in  the 
sunshine.”  That’s  not  a  plan.  That’s  a  travel  poster.  After  eight  margaritas,  you’re 
fit  only  to  await  the  hangover.  After  three  weeks  of  margarita-filled  days,  if  you 
have  any  sense,  you’re  bored  stiff  and  self-disgusted.  In  a  year,  or  less,  you’re 
pathetic.  It’s  just  not  a  sustainable  approach  to  later  life.  This  kind  of 
oversimplification  and  falsification  is  particularly  typical  of  ideologues.  They 
adopt  a  single  axiom:  government  is  bad,  immigration  is  bad,  capitalism  is  bad, 
patriarchy  is  bad.  Then  they  filter  and  screen  their  experiences  and  insist  ever 
more  narrowly  that  everything  can  be  explained  by  that  axiom.  They  believe, 
narcissistically,  underneath  all  that  bad  theory,  that  the  world  could  be  put  right, 
if  only  they  held  the  controls. 

There  is  another  fundamental  problem,  too,  with  the  life-lie,  particularly  when 
it  is  based  on  avoidance.  A  sin  of  commission  occurs  when  you  do  something 
you  know  to  be  wrong.  A  sin  of  omission  occurs  when  you  let  something  bad 
happen  when  you  could  do  something  to  stop  it.  The  former  is  regarded, 
classically,  as  more  serious  than  the  latter — than  avoidance.  I’m  not  so  sure. 

Consider  the  person  who  insists  that  everything  is  right  in  her  life.  She  avoids 
conflict,  and  smiles,  and  does  what  she  is  asked  to  do.  She  finds  a  niche  and 
hides  in  it.  She  does  not  question  authority  or  put  her  own  ideas  forward,  and 
does  not  complain  when  mistreated.  She  strives  for  invisibility,  like  a  fish  in  the 
centre  of  a  swarming  school.  But  a  secret  unrest  gnaws  at  her  heart.  She  is  still 
suffering,  because  life  is  suffering.  She  is  lonesome  and  isolated  and  unfulfilled. 
But  her  obedience  and  self-obliteration  eliminate  all  the  meaning  from  her  life. 
She  has  become  nothing  but  a  slave,  a  tool  for  others  to  exploit.  She  does  not  get 
what  she  wants,  or  needs,  because  doing  so  would  mean  speaking  her  mind.  So, 
there  is  nothing  of  value  in  her  existence  to  counter-balance  life’s  troubles.  And 
that  makes  her  sick. 

It  might  be  the  noisy  troublemakers  who  disappear,  first,  when  the  institution 
you  serve  falters  and  shrinks.  But  it’s  the  invisible  who  will  be  sacrificed  next. 
Someone  hiding  is  not  someone  vital.  Vitality  requires  original  contribution. 
Hiding  also  does  not  save  the  conforming  and  conventional  from  disease, 
insanity,  death  and  taxes.  And  hiding  from  others  also  means  suppressing  and 
hiding  the  potentialities  of  the  unrealized  self.  And  that’s  the  problem. 

If  you  will  not  reveal  yourself  to  others,  you  cannot  reveal  yourself  to 
yourself.  That  does  not  only  mean  that  you  suppress  who  you  are,  although  it 


also  means  that.  It  means  that  so  much  of  what  you  could  be  will  never  be  forced 
by  necessity  to  come  forward.  This  is  a  biological  truth,  as  well  as  a  conceptual 
truth.  When  you  explore  boldly,  when  you  voluntarily  confront  the  unknown, 
you  gather  information  and  build  your  renewed  self  out  of  that  information.  That 
is  the  conceptual  element.  However,  researchers  have  recently  discovered  that 
new  genes  in  the  central  nervous  system  turn  themselves  on  when  an  organism  is 
placed  (or  places  itself)  in  a  new  situation.  These  genes  code  for  new  proteins. 
These  proteins  are  the  building  blocks  for  new  structures  in  the  brain.  This 
means  that  a  lot  of  you  is  still  nascent,  in  the  most  physical  of  senses,  and  will 
not  be  called  forth  by  stasis.  You  have  to  say  something,  go  somewhere  and  do 
things  to  get  turned  on.  And,  if  not  . . .  you  remain  incomplete,  and  life  is  too 
hard  for  anyone  incomplete. 

If  you  say  no  to  your  boss,  or  your  spouse,  or  your  mother,  when  it  needs  to  be 
said,  then  you  transform  yourself  into  someone  who  can  say  no  when  it  needs  to 
be  said.  If  you  say  yes  when  no  needs  to  be  said,  however,  you  transform 
yourself  into  someone  who  can  only  say  yes,  even  when  it  is  very  clearly  time  to 
say  no.  If  you  ever  wonder  how  perfectly  ordinary,  decent  people  could  find 
themselves  doing  the  terrible  things  the  gulag  camp  guards  did,  you  now  have 
your  answer.  By  the  time  no  seriously  needed  to  be  said,  there  was  no  one  left 
capable  of  saying  it. 

If  you  betray  yourself,  if  you  say  untrue  things,  if  you  act  out  a  lie,  you 
weaken  your  character.  If  you  have  a  weak  character,  then  adversity  will  mow 
you  down  when  it  appears,  as  it  will,  inevitably.  You  will  hide,  but  there  will  be 
no  place  left  to  hide.  And  then  you  will  find  yourself  doing  terrible  things. 

Only  the  most  cynical,  hopeless  philosophy  insists  that  reality  could  be 
improved  through  falsification.  Such  a  philosophy  judges  Being  and  becoming 
alike,  and  deems  them  flawed.  It  denounces  truth  as  insufficient  and  the  honest 
man  as  deluded.  It  is  a  philosophy  that  both  brings  about  and  then  justifies  the 
endemic  corruption  of  the  world. 

It  is  not  vision  as  such,  and  not  a  plan  devised  to  achieve  a  vision,  that  is  at 
fault  under  such  circumstances.  A  vision  of  the  future,  the  desirable  future,  is 
necessary.  Such  a  vision  links  action  taken  now  with  important,  long-term, 
foundational  values.  It  lends  actions  in  the  present  significance  and  importance. 

It  provides  a  frame  limiting  uncertainty  and  anxiety. 

It’s  not  vision.  It  is  instead  willful  blindness.  It’s  the  worst  sort  of  lie.  It’s 
subtle.  It  avails  itself  of  easy  rationalizations.  Willful  blindness  is  the  refusal  to 
know  something  that  could  be  known.  It’s  refusal  to  admit  that  the  knocking 
sound  means  someone  at  the  door.  It’s  refusal  to  acknowledge  the  eight-hundred- 
pound  gorilla  in  the  room,  the  elephant  under  the  carpet,  the  skeleton  in  the 


closet.  It’s  refusal  to  admit  to  error  while  pursuing  the  plan.  Every  game  has 
rules.  Some  of  the  most  important  rules  are  implicit.  You  accept  them  merely  by 
deciding  to  play  the  game.  The  first  of  these  rules  is  that  the  game  is  important. 

If  it  wasn’t  important,  you  wouldn’t  be  playing  it.  Playing  a  game  defines  it  as 
important.  The  second  is  that  moves  undertaken  during  the  game  are  valid  if  they 
help  you  win.  If  you  make  a  move  and  it  isn’t  helping  you  win,  then,  by 
definition,  it’s  a  bad  move.  You  need  to  try  something  different.  You  remember 
the  old  joke:  insanity  is  doing  the  same  thing  over  and  over  while  expecting 
different  results. 

If  you’re  lucky,  and  you  fail,  and  you  try  something  new,  you  move  ahead.  If 
that  doesn’t  work,  you  try  something  different  again.  A  minor  modification  will 
suffice  in  fortunate  circumstances.  It  is  therefore  prudent  to  begin  with  small 
changes,  and  see  if  they  help.  Sometimes,  however,  the  entire  hierarchy  of  values 
is  faulty,  and  the  whole  edifice  has  to  be  abandoned.  The  whole  game  must  be 
changed.  That’s  a  revolution,  with  all  the  chaos  and  terror  of  a  revolution.  It’s 
not  something  to  be  engaged  in  lightly,  but  it’s  sometimes  necessary.  Error 
necessitates  sacrifice  to  correct  it,  and  serious  error  necessitates  serious  sacrifice. 
To  accept  the  truth  means  to  sacrifice — and  if  you  have  rejected  the  truth  for  a 
long  time,  then  you’ve  run  up  a  dangerously  large  sacrificial  debt.  Forest  fires 
burn  out  deadwood  and  return  trapped  elements  to  the  soil.  Sometimes,  however, 
fires  are  suppressed,  artificially.  That  does  not  stop  the  deadwood  from 
accumulating.  Sooner  or  later,  a  fire  will  start.  When  it  does,  it  will  burn  so  hot 
that  everything  will  be  destroyed — even  the  soil  in  which  the  forest  grows. 

The  prideful,  rational  mind,  comfortable  with  its  certainty,  enamoured  of  its 
own  brilliance,  is  easily  tempted  to  ignore  error,  and  to  sweep  dirt  under  the  rug. 
Literary,  existential  philosophers,  beginning  with  Soren  Kierkegaard,  conceived 
of  this  mode  of  Being  as  “inauthentic.”  An  inauthentic  person  continues  to 
perceive  and  act  in  ways  his  own  experience  has  demonstrated  false.  He  does  not 
speak  with  his  own  voice. 

“Did  what  I  want  happen?  No.  Then  my  aim  or  my  methods  were  wrong.  I 
still  have  something  to  learn.”  That  is  the  voice  of  authenticity. 

“Did  what  I  want  happen?  No.  Then  the  world  is  unfair.  People  are  jealous, 
and  too  stupid  to  understand.  It  is  the  fault  of  something  or  someone  else.”  That 
is  the  voice  of  inauthenticity.  It  is  not  too  far  from  there  to  “they  should  be 
stopped”  or  “they  must  be  hurt”  or  “they  must  be  destroyed.”  Whenever  you 
hear  about  something  incomprehensibly  brutal,  such  ideas  have  manifested 
themselves. 

There  is  no  blaming  any  of  this  on  unconsciousness,  either,  or  repression. 
When  the  individual  lies,  he  knows  it.  He  may  blind  himself  to  the  consequences 


of  his  actions.  He  may  fail  to  analyze  and  articulate  his  past,  so  that  he  does  not 
understand.  He  may  even  forget  that  he  lied  and  so  be  unconscious  of  that  fact. 
But  he  was  conscious,  in  the  present,  during  the  commission  of  each  error,  and 
the  omission  of  each  responsibility.  At  that  moment,  he  knew  what  he  was  up  to. 
And  the  sins  of  the  inauthentic  individual  compound  and  corrupt  the  state. 

Someone  power-hungry  makes  a  new  rule  at  your  workplace.  It’s  unnecessary. 
It’s  counterproductive.  It’s  an  irritant.  It  removes  some  of  the  pleasure  and 
meaning  from  your  work.  But  you  tell  yourself  it’s  all  right.  It’s  not  worth 
complaining  about.  Then  it  happens  again.  You’ve  already  trained  yourself  to 
allow  such  things,  by  failing  to  react  the  first  time.  You’re  a  little  less 
courageous.  Your  opponent,  unopposed,  is  a  little  bit  stronger.  The  institution  is  a 
little  bit  more  corrupt.  The  process  of  bureaucratic  stagnation  and  oppression  is 
underway,  and  you’ve  contributed,  by  pretending  that  it  was  OK.  Why  not 
complain?  Why  not  take  a  stand?  If  you  do,  other  people,  equally  afraid  to  speak 
up,  may  come  to  your  defence.  And  if  not — maybe  it’s  time  for  a  revolution. 
Maybe  you  should  find  a  job  somewhere  else,  where  your  soul  is  less  in  danger 
from  corruption. 

For  what  shall  it  profit  a  man  if  he  gain  the  whole  world  and  forfeit  his  soul? 
(Mark  8:36) 

One  of  the  major  contributions  of  Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn’s  masterwork,  The 
Gulag  Archipelago,  was  his  analysis  of  the  direct  causal  relationship  between  the 
pathology  of  the  Soviet  prison-work-camp  dependent  state  (where  millions 
suffered  and  died)  and  the  almost  universal  proclivity  of  the  Soviet  citizen  to 
falsify  his  own  day-to-day  personal  experience,  deny  his  own  state-induced 
suffering,  and  thereby  prop  up  the  dictates  of  the  rational,  ideology-possessed 
communist  system.  It  was  this  bad  faith,  this  denial,  that  in  Solzhenitsyn’s 
opinion  aided  and  abetted  that  great  paranoid  mass-murderer,  Joseph  Stalin,  in 
his  crimes.  Solzhenitsyn  wrote  the  truth,  his  truth,  hard-learned  through  his  own 
experiences  in  the  camps,  exposing  the  lies  of  the  Soviet  state.  No  educated 
person  dared  defend  that  ideology  again  after  Solzhenitsyn  published  The  Gulag 
Archipelago.  No  one  could  ever  say  again,  “What  Stalin  did,  that  was  not  true 
communism.” 

Viktor  Frankl,  the  psychiatrist  and  Nazi  concentration  camp  survivor  who 
wrote  the  classic  Man’s  Search  for  Meaning,  drew  a  similar  social-psychological 
conclusion:  deceitful,  inauthentic  individual  existence  is  the  precursor  to  social 
totalitarianism.  Sigmund  Freud,  for  his  part,  analogously  believed  that 
“repression”  contributed  in  a  non-trivial  manner  to  the  development  of  mental 
illness  (and  the  difference  between  repression  of  truth  and  a  lie  is  a  matter  of 
degree,  not  kind).  Alfred  Adler  knew  it  was  lies  that  bred  sickness.  C.G.  Jung 


knew  that  moral  problems  plagued  his  patients,  and  that  such  problems  were 
caused  by  untruth.  All  these  thinkers,  all  centrally  concerned  with  pathology 
both  individual  and  cultural,  came  to  the  same  conclusion:  lies  warp  the  structure 
of  Being.  Untruth  corrupts  the  soul  and  the  state  alike,  and  one  form  of 
corruption  feeds  the  other. 

I  have  repeatedly  observed  the  transformation  of  mere  existential  misery  into 
outright  hell  by  betrayal  and  deceit.  The  barely  manageable  crisis  of  a  parent’s 
terminal  illness  can  be  turned,  for  example,  into  something  awful  beyond 
description  by  the  unseemly  and  petty  squabbling  of  the  sufferer’s  adult  children. 
Obsessed  by  the  unresolved  past,  they  gather  like  ghouls  around  the  deathbed, 
forcing  tragedy  into  an  unholy  dalliance  with  cowardice  and  resentment. 

The  inability  of  a  son  to  thrive  independently  is  exploited  by  a  mother  bent  on 
shielding  her  child  from  all  disappointment  and  pain.  He  never  leaves,  and  she  is 
never  lonely.  It’s  an  evil  conspiracy,  forged  slowly,  as  the  pathology  unfolds,  by 
thousands  of  knowing  winks  and  nods.  She  plays  the  martyr,  doomed  to  support 
her  son,  and  garners  nourishing  sympathy,  like  a  vampire,  from  supporting 
friends.  He  broods  in  his  basement,  imagining  himself  oppressed.  He  fantasizes 
with  delight  about  the  havoc  he  might  wreak  on  the  world  that  rejected  him  for 
his  cowardice,  awkwardness  and  inability.  And  sometimes  he  wreaks  precisely 
that  havoc.  And  everyone  asks,  “Why?”  They  could  know,  but  refuse  to. 

Even  well-lived  lives  can,  of  course,  be  warped  and  hurt  and  twisted  by  illness 
and  infirmity  and  uncontrollable  catastrophe.  Depression,  bipolar  disorder  and 
schizophrenia,  like  cancer,  all  involve  biological  factors  beyond  the  individual’s 
immediate  control.  The  difficulties  intrinsic  to  life  itself  are  sufficient  to  weaken 
and  overwhelm  each  of  us,  pushing  us  beyond  our  limits,  breaking  us  at  our 
weakest  point.  Not  even  the  best-lived  life  provides  an  absolute  defence  against 
vulnerability.  But  the  family  that  fights  in  the  ruins  of  their  earthquake- 
devastated  dwelling  place  is  much  less  likely  to  rebuild  than  the  family  made 
strong  by  mutual  trust  and  devotion.  Any  natural  weakness  or  existential 
challenge,  no  matter  how  minor,  can  be  magnified  into  a  serious  crisis  with 
enough  deceit  in  the  individual,  family  or  culture. 

The  honest  human  spirit  may  continually  fail  in  its  attempts  to  bring  about 
Paradise  on  Earth.  It  may  manage,  however,  to  reduce  the  suffering  attendant  on 
existence  to  bearable  levels.  The  tragedy  of  Being  is  the  consequence  of  our 
limitations  and  the  vulnerability  defining  human  experience.  It  may  even  be  the 
price  we  pay  for  Being  itself — since  existence  must  be  limited,  to  be  at  all. 

I  have  seen  a  husband  adapt  honestly  and  courageously  while  his  wife 
descended  into  terminal  dementia.  He  made  the  necessary  adjustments,  step  by 
step.  He  accepted  help  when  he  needed  it.  He  refused  to  deny  her  sad 


deterioration  and  in  that  manner  adapted  gracefully  to  it.  I  saw  the  family  of  that 
same  woman  come  together  in  a  supporting  and  sustaining  manner  as  she  lay 
dying,  and  gain  newfound  connections  with  each  other — brother,  sisters, 
grandchildren  and  father — as  partial  but  genuine  compensation  for  their  loss.  I 
have  seen  my  teenage  daughter  live  through  the  destruction  of  her  hip  and  her 
ankle  and  survive  two  years  of  continual,  intense  pain  and  emerge  with  her  spirit 
intact.  I  watched  her  younger  brother  voluntarily  and  without  resentment 
sacrifice  many  opportunities  for  friendship  and  social  engagement  to  stand  by 
her  and  us  while  she  suffered.  With  love,  encouragement,  and  character  intact,  a 
human  being  can  be  resilient  beyond  imagining.  What  cannot  be  borne,  however, 
is  the  absolute  ruin  produced  by  tragedy  and  deception. 

The  capacity  of  the  rational  mind  to  deceive,  manipulate,  scheme,  trick, 
falsify,  minimize,  mislead,  betray,  prevaricate,  deny,  omit,  rationalize,  bias, 
exaggerate  and  obscure  is  so  endless,  so  remarkable,  that  centuries  of  pre- 
scientific  thought,  concentrating  on  clarifying  the  nature  of  moral  endeavour, 
regarded  it  as  positively  demonic.  This  is  not  because  of  rationality  itself,  as  a 
process.  That  process  can  produce  clarity  and  progress.  It  is  because  rationality 
is  subject  to  the  single  worst  temptation — to  raise  what  it  knows  now  to  the 
status  of  an  absolute. 

We  can  turn  to  the  great  poet  John  Milton,  once  again,  to  clarify  just  what  this 
means.  Over  thousands  of  years  of  history,  the  Western  world  wrapped  a  dream¬ 
like  fantasy  about  the  nature  of  evil  around  its  central  religious  core.  That 
fantasy  had  a  protagonist,  an  adversarial  personality,  absolutely  dedicated  to  the 
corruption  of  Being.  Milton  took  it  upon  himself  to  organize,  dramatize  and 
articulate  the  essence  of  this  collective  dream,  and  gave  it  life,  in  the  figure  of 
Satan — Lucifer,  the  “light  bearer.”  He  writes  of  Lucifer’s  primal  temptation,  and 
its  immediate  consequences: 

He  trusted  to  have  equaled  the  most  High, 

If  he  opposed;  and  with  ambitious  aim 
Against  the  Throne  and  Monarchy  of  God 
Raised  impious  War  in  Heaven  and  Battel  proud 
With  vain  attempt.  Him  the  Almighty  Power 
Hurled  headlong  flaming  from  the  Ethereal  Sky 
With  hideous  ruin  and  combustion  down 
To  bottomless  perdition,  there  to  dwell 
In  Adamantine  Chains  and  penal  Fire  . . . 

Lucifer,  in  Milton’s  eyes — the  spirit  of  reason — was  the  most  wondrous  angel 
brought  forth  from  the  void  by  God.  This  can  be  read  psychologically.  Reason  is 
something  alive.  It  lives  in  all  of  us.  It’s  older  than  any  of  us.  It’s  best  understood 
as  a  personality,  not  a  faculty.  It  has  its  aims,  and  its  temptations,  and  its 


weaknesses.  It  flies  higher  and  sees  farther  than  any  other  spirit.  But  reason  falls 
in  love  with  itself,  and  worse.  It  falls  in  love  with  its  own  productions.  It  elevates 
them,  and  worships  them  as  absolutes.  Lucifer  is,  therefore,  the  spirit  of 
totalitarianism.  He  is  flung  from  Heaven  into  Hell  because  such  elevation,  such 
rebellion  against  the  Highest  and  Incomprehensible,  inevitably  produces  Hell. 

To  say  it  again:  it  is  the  greatest  temptation  of  the  rational  faculty  to  glorify  its 
own  capacity  and  its  own  productions  and  to  claim  that  in  the  face  of  its  theories 
nothing  transcendent  or  outside  its  domain  need  exist.  This  means  that  all 
important  facts  have  been  discovered.  This  means  that  nothing  important 
remains  unknown.  But  most  importantly,  it  means  denial  of  the  necessity  for 
courageous  individual  confrontation  with  Being.  What  is  going  to  save  you?  The 
totalitarian  says,  in  essence,  “You  must  rely  on  faith  in  what  you  already  know.” 
But  that  is  not  what  saves.  What  saves  is  the  willingness  to  learn  from  what  you 
don  ’ t  know.  That  is  faith  in  the  possibility  of  human  transformation.  That  is  faith 
in  the  sacrifice  of  the  current  self  for  the  self  that  could  be.  The  totalitarian 
denies  the  necessity  for  the  individual  to  take  ultimate  responsibility  for  Being. 

That  denial  is  the  meaning  of  rebellion  against  “the  most  High.”  That  is  what 
totalitarian  means:  Everything  that  needs  to  be  discovered  has  been  discovered. 
Everything  will  unfold  precisely  as  planned.  All  problems  will  vanish,  forever, 
once  the  perfect  system  is  accepted.  Milton’s  great  poem  was  a  prophecy.  As 
rationality  rose  ascendant  from  the  ashes  of  Christianity,  the  great  threat  of  total 
systems  accompanied  it.  Communism,  in  particular,  was  attractive  not  so  much 
to  oppressed  workers,  its  hypothetical  beneficiaries,  but  to  intellectuals — to 
those  whose  arrogant  pride  in  intellect  assured  them  they  were  always  right.  But 
the  promised  utopia  never  emerged.  Instead  humanity  experienced  the  inferno  of 
Stalinist  Russia  and  Mao’s  China  and  Pol  Pot’s  Cambodia,  and  the  citizens  of 
those  states  were  required  to  betray  their  own  experience,  turn  against  their 
fellow  citizens,  and  die  in  the  tens  of  millions. 

There  is  an  old  Soviet  joke.  An  American  dies  and  goes  to  hell.  Satan  himself 
shows  him  around.  They  pass  a  large  cauldron.  The  American  peers  in.  It’s  full 
of  suffering  souls,  burning  in  hot  pitch.  As  they  struggle  to  leave  the  pot,  low- 
ranking  devils,  sitting  on  the  rim,  pitchfork  them  back  in.  The  American  is 
properly  shocked.  Satan  says,  “That’s  where  we  put  sinful  Englishmen.”  The 
tour  continues.  Soon  the  duo  approaches  a  second  cauldron.  It’s  slightly  larger, 
and  slightly  hotter.  The  American  peers  in.  It  is  also  full  of  suffering  souls,  all 
wearing  berets.  Devils  are  pitchforking  would-be  escapees  back  into  this 
cauldron,  as  well.  “That’s  where  we  put  sinful  Frenchmen,”  Satan  says.  In  the 
distance  is  a  third  cauldron.  It’s  much  bigger,  and  is  glowing,  white  hot.  The 
American  can  barely  get  near  it.  Nonetheless,  at  Satan’s  insistence,  he 


approaches  it  and  peers  in.  It  is  absolutely  packed  with  souls,  barely  visible, 
under  the  surface  of  the  boiling  liquid.  Now  and  then,  however,  one  clambers  out 
of  the  pitch  and  desperately  reaches  for  the  rim.  Oddly,  there  are  no  devils  sitting 
on  the  edge  of  this  giant  pot,  but  the  clamberer  disappears  back  under  the  surface 
anyway.  The  American  asks,  “Why  are  there  no  demons  here  to  keep  everyone 
from  escaping?”  Satan  replies,  “This  is  where  we  put  the  Russians.  If  one  tries  to 
escape,  the  others  pull  him  back  in.” 

Milton  believed  that  stubborn  refusal  to  change  in  the  face  of  error  not  only 
meant  ejection  from  heaven,  and  subsequent  degeneration  into  an  ever- 
deepening  hell,  but  the  rejection  of  redemption  itself.  Satan  knows  full  well  that 
even  if  he  was  willing  to  seek  reconciliation,  and  God  willing  to  grant  it,  he 
would  only  rebel  again,  because  he  will  not  change.  Perhaps  it  is  this  prideful 
stubbornness  that  constitutes  the  mysterious  unforgivable  sin  against  the  Holy 
Ghost: 

. . .  Farewell  happy  Fields 
Where  Joy  for  ever  dwells:  Hail  horrors,  hail 
Infernal  world,  and  thou  profoundest  Hell 
Receive  thy  new  Possessor:  One  who  brings

A  mind  not  to  be  changed  by  Place  or  Time. 

This  is  no  afterlife  fantasy.  This  is  no  perverse  realm  of  post-existence  torture  for 
political  enemies.  This  is  an  abstract  idea,  and  abstractions  are  often  more  real 
than  what  they  represent.  The  idea  that  hell  exists  in  some  metaphysical  manner 
is  not  only  ancient,  and  pervasive;  it’s  true.  Hell  is  eternal.  It  has  always  existed. 
It  exists  now.  It’s  the  most  barren,  hopeless  and  malevolent  subdivision  of  the 
underworld  of  chaos,  where  disappointed  and  resentful  people  forever  dwell. 

The  mind  is  its  own  place,  and  in  itself 
Can  make  a  Heav’n  of  Hell,  a  Hell  ofHeav’n. 

Here  we  may  reign  secure,  and  in  my  choice 
To  reign  is  worth  ambition  though  in  Hell:

Better  to  reign  in  Hell,  than  serve  in  Heav’n. 

Those  who  have  lied  enough,  in  word  and  action,  live  there,  in  hell — now.  Take 
a  walk  down  any  busy  urban  street.  Keep  your  eyes  open  and  pay  attention.  You 
will  see  people  who  are  there,  now.  These  are  the  people  to  whom  you 
instinctively  give  a  wide  berth.  These  are  the  people  who  are  immediately 
angered  if  you  direct  your  gaze  toward  them,  although  sometimes  they  will 
instead  turn  away  in  shame.  I  saw  a  horribly  damaged  street  alcoholic  do  exactly 
that  in  the  presence  of  my  young  daughter.  He  wanted  above  all  to  avoid  seeing 
his  degraded  state  incontrovertibly  reflected  in  her  eyes. 


It  is  deceit  that  makes  people  miserable  beyond  what  they  can  bear.  It  is  deceit 
that  fills  human  souls  with  resentment  and  vengefulness.  It  is  deceit  that 
produces  the  terrible  suffering  of  mankind:  the  death  camps  of  the  Nazis;  the 
torture  chambers  and  genocides  of  Stalin  and  that  even  greater  monster,  Mao.  It 
was  deceit  that  killed  hundreds  of  millions  of  people  in  the  twentieth  century.  It 
was  deceit  that  almost  doomed  civilization  itself.  It  is  deceit  that  still  threatens 
us,  most  profoundly,  today. 

The  Truth,  Instead 

What  happens  if,  instead,  we  decide  to  stop  lying?  What  does  this  even  mean? 
We  are  limited  in  our  knowledge,  after  all.  We  must  make  decisions,  here  and 
now,  even  though  the  best  means  and  the  best  goals  can  never  be  discerned  with 
certainty.  An  aim,  an  ambition,  provides  the  structure  necessary  for  action.  An 
aim  provides  a  destination,  a  point  of  contrast  against  the  present,  and  a 
framework,  within  which  all  things  can  be  evaluated.  An  aim  defines  progress 
and  makes  such  progress  exciting.  An  aim  reduces  anxiety,  because  if  you  have 
no  aim  everything  can  mean  anything  or  nothing,  and  neither  of  those  two 
options  makes  for  a  tranquil  spirit.  Thus,  we  have  to  think,  and  plan,  and  limit, 
and  posit,  in  order  to  live  at  all.  How  then  to  envision  the  future,  and  establish 
our  direction,  without  falling  prey  to  the  temptation  of  totalitarian  certainty? 

Some  reliance  on  tradition  can  help  us  establish  our  aims.  It  is  reasonable  to 
do  what  other  people  have  always  done,  unless  we  have  a  very  good  reason  not 
to.  It  is  reasonable  to  become  educated  and  work  and  find  love  and  have  a 
family.  That  is  how  culture  maintains  itself.  But  it  is  necessary  to  aim  at  your 
target,  however  traditional,  with  your  eyes  wide  open.  You  have  a  direction,  but 
it  might  be  wrong.  You  have  a  plan,  but  it  might  be  ill-formed.  You  may  have 
been  led  astray  by  your  own  ignorance — and,  worse,  by  your  own  unrevealed 
corruption.  You  must  make  friends,  therefore,  with  what  you  don’t  know,  instead 
of  what  you  know.  You  must  remain  awake  to  catch  yourself  in  the  act.  You  must 
remove  the  beam  in  your  own  eye,  before  you  concern  yourself  with  the  mote  in 
your  brother’s.  And  in  this  way,  you  strengthen  your  own  spirit,  so  it  can  tolerate 
the  burden  of  existence,  and  you  rejuvenate  the  state. 

The  ancient  Egyptians  had  already  figured  this  out  thousands  of  years  ago, 
although  their  knowledge  remained  embodied  in  dramatic  form.  They 
worshipped  Osiris,  mythological  founder  of  the  state  and  the  god  of  tradition. 
Osiris,  however,  was  vulnerable  to  overthrow  and  banishment  to  the  underworld 
by  Set,  his  evil,  scheming  brother.  The  Egyptians  represented  in  story  the  fact 
that  social  organizations  ossify  with  time,  and  tend  towards  willful  blindness. 


Osiris  would  not  see  his  brother’s  true  character,  even  though  he  could  have.  Set 
waits  and,  at  an  opportune  moment,  attacks.  He  hacks  Osiris  into  pieces,  and 
scatters  the  divine  remains  through  the  kingdom.  He  sends  his  brother’s  spirit  to 
the  underworld.  He  makes  it  very  difficult  for  Osiris  to  pull  himself  back 
together. 

Fortunately,  the  great  king  did  not  have  to  deal  with  Set  on  his  own.  The 
Egyptians  also  worshipped  Horns,  the  son  of  Osiris.  Horus  took  the  twin  forms 
of  a  falcon,  the  most  visually  acute  of  all  creatures,  and  the  still-famous 
hieroglyphic  single  Egyptian  eye  (as  alluded  to  in  Rule  7).  Osiris  is  tradition, 
aged  and  willfully  blind.  Horus,  his  son,  could  and  would,  by  contrast,  see. 

Horus  was  the  god  of  attention.  That  is  not  the  same  as  rationality.  Because  he 
paid  attention,  Horus  could  perceive  and  triumph  against  the  evils  of  Set,  his 
uncle,  albeit  at  great  cost.  When  Horus  confronts  Set,  they  have  a  terrible  battle. 
Before  Set’s  defeat  and  banishment  from  the  kingdom,  he  tears  out  one  of  his 
nephew’s  eyes.  But  the  eventually  victorious  Horus  takes  back  the  eye.  Then  he 
does  something  truly  unexpected:  he  journeys  voluntarily  to  the  underworld  and 
gives  the  eye  to  his  father. 

What  does  this  mean?  First,  that  the  encounter  with  malevolence  and  evil  is  of 
sufficient  terror  to  damage  even  the  vision  of  a  god;  second,  that  the  attentive 
son  can  restore  the  vision  of  his  father.  Culture  is  always  in  a  near-dead  state, 
even  though  it  was  established  by  the  spirit  of  great  people  in  the  past.  But  the 
present  is  not  the  past.  The  wisdom  of  the  past  thus  deteriorates,  or  becomes 
outdated,  in  proportion  to  the  genuine  difference  between  the  conditions  of  the 
present  and  the  past.  That  is  a  mere  consequence  of  the  passage  of  time,  and  the 
change  that  passage  inevitably  brings.  But  it  is  also  the  case  that  culture  and  its 
wisdom  is  additionally  vulnerable  to  corruption — to  voluntary,  willful  blindness 
and  Mephistophelean  intrigue.  Thus,  the  inevitable  functional  decline  of  the 
institutions  granted  to  us  by  our  ancestors  is  sped  along  by  our  misbehavior — our 
missing  of  the  mark — in  the  present. 

It  is  our  responsibility  to  see  what  is  before  our  eyes,  courageously,  and  to 
learn  from  it,  even  if  it  seems  horrible — even  if  the  horror  of  seeing  it  damages 
our  consciousness,  and  half-blinds  us.  The  act  of  seeing  is  particularly  important 
when  it  challenges  what  we  know  and  rely  on,  upsetting  and  destabilizing  us.  It 
is  the  act  of  seeing  that  informs  the  individual  and  updates  the  state.  It  was  for 
this  reason  that  Nietzsche  said  that  a  man’s  worth  was  determined  by  how  much 
truth  he  could  tolerate.  You  are  by  no  means  only  what  you  already  know.  You 
are  also  all  that  which  you  could  know,  if  you  only  would.  Thus,  you  should 
never  sacrifice  what  you  could  be  for  what  you  are.  You  should  never  give  up  the 
better  that  resides  within  for  the  security  you  already  have — and  certainly  not 


when  you  have  already  caught  a  glimpse,  an  undeniable  glimpse,  of  something 
beyond. 

In  the  Christian  tradition,  Christ  is  identified  with  the  Logos.  The  Logos  is  the 
Word  of  God.  That  Word  transformed  chaos  into  order  at  the  beginning  of  time. 
In  His  human  form,  Christ  sacrificed  himself  voluntarily  to  the  truth,  to  the  good, 
to  God.  In  consequence,  He  died  and  was  reborn.  The  Word  that  produces  order 
from  Chaos  sacrifices  everything,  even  itself,  to  God.  That  single  sentence,  wise 
beyond  comprehension,  sums  up  Christianity.  Every  bit  of  learning  is  a  little 
death.  Every  bit  of  new  information  challenges  a  previous  conception,  forcing  it 
to  dissolve  into  chaos  before  it  can  be  reborn  as  something  better.  Sometimes 
such  deaths  virtually  destroy  us.  In  such  cases,  we  might  never  recover  or,  if  we 
do,  we  change  a  lot.  A  good  friend  of  mine  discovered  that  his  wife  of  decades 
was  having  an  affair.  He  didn’t  see  it  coming.  It  plunged  him  into  a  deep 
depression.  He  descended  into  the  underworld.  He  told  me,  at  one  point,  “I 
always  thought  that  people  who  were  depressed  should  just  shake  it  off.  I  didn’t 
have  any  idea  what  I  was  talking  about.”  Eventually,  he  returned  from  the 
depths.  In  many  ways,  he’s  a  new  man — and,  perhaps,  a  wiser  and  better  man. 

He  lost  forty  pounds.  He  ran  a  marathon.  He  travelled  to  Africa  and  climbed 
Mount  Kilimanjaro.  He  chose  rebirth  over  descent  into  Hell. 

Set  your  ambitions,  even  if  you  are  uncertain  about  what  they  should  be.  The 
better  ambitions  have  to  do  with  the  development  of  character  and  ability,  rather 
than  status  and  power.  Status  you  can  lose.  You  carry  character  with  you 
wherever  you  go,  and  it  allows  you  to  prevail  against  adversity.  Knowing  this,  tie 
a  rope  to  a  boulder.  Pick  up  the  great  stone,  heave  it  in  front  of  you,  and  pull 
yourself  towards  it.  Watch  and  observe  while  you  move  forward.  Articulate  your 
experience  as  clearly  and  carefully  to  yourself  and  others  as  you  possibly  can.  In 
this  manner,  you  will  learn  to  proceed  more  effectively  and  efficiently  towards 
your  goal.  And,  while  you  are  doing  this,  do  not  lie.  Especially  to  yourself. 

If  you  pay  attention  to  what  you  do  and  say,  you  can  learn  to  feel  a  state  of 
internal  division  and  weakness  when  you  are  misbehaving  and  misspeaking.  It’s 
an  embodied  sensation,  not  a  thought.  I  experience  an  internal  sensation  of 
sinking  and  division,  rather  than  solidity  and  strength,  when  I  am  incautious  with 
my  acts  and  words.  It  seems  to  be  centred  in  my  solar  plexus,  where  a  large  knot 
of  nervous  tissue  resides.  I  learned  to  recognize  when  I  was  lying,  in  fact,  by 
noticing  this  sinking  and  division,  and  then  inferring  the  presence  of  a  lie.  It 
often  took  me  a  long  time  to  ferret  out  the  deception.  Sometimes  I  was  using 
words  for  appearance.  Sometimes  I  was  trying  to  disguise  my  own  true 
ignorance  of  the  topic  at  hand.  Sometimes  I  was  using  the  words  of  others  to 
avoid  the  responsibility  of  thinking  for  myself. 


If  you  pay  attention,  when  you  are  seeking  something,  you  will  move  towards 
your  goal.  More  importantly,  however,  you  will  acquire  the  information  that 
allows  your  goal  itself  to  transform.  A  totalitarian  never  asks,  “What  if  my 
current  ambition  is  in  error?”  He  treats  it,  instead,  as  the  Absolute.  It  becomes 
his  God,  for  all  intents  and  purposes.  It  constitutes  his  highest  value.  It  regulates 
his  emotions  and  motivational  states,  and  determines  his  thoughts.  All  people 
serve  their  ambition.  In  that  matter,  there  are  no  atheists.  There  are  only  people 
who  know,  and  don’t  know,  what  God  they  serve. 

If  you  bend  everything  totally,  blindly  and  willfully  towards  the  attainment  of 
a  goal,  and  only  that  goal,  you  will  never  be  able  to  discover  if  another  goal 
would  serve  you,  and  the  world,  better.  It  is  this  that  you  sacrifice  if  you  do  not 
tell  the  truth.  If,  instead,  you  tell  the  truth,  your  values  transform  as  you 
progress.  If  you  allow  yourself  to  be  informed  by  the  reality  manifesting  itself, 
as  you  struggle  forward,  your  notions  of  what  is  important  will  change.  You  will 
reorient  yourself,  sometimes  gradually,  and  sometimes  suddenly  and  radically. 

Imagine:  you  go  to  engineering  school,  because  that  is  what  your  parents 
desire — but  it  is  not  what  you  want.  Working  at  cross-purposes  to  your  own 
wishes,  you  will  find  yourself  unmotivated,  and  failing.  You  will  struggle  to 
concentrate  and  discipline  yourself,  but  it  will  not  work.  Your  soul  will  reject  the 
tyranny  of  your  will  (how  else  could  that  be  said?).  Why  are  you  complying? 
You  may  not  want  to  disappoint  your  parents  (although  if  you  fail  you  will  do 
exactly  that).  You  may  lack  the  courage  for  the  conflict  necessary  to  free 
yourself.  You  may  not  want  to  sacrifice  your  childish  belief  in  parental 
omniscience,  wishing  devoutly  to  continue  believing  that  there  is  someone  who 
knows  you  better  than  you  know  yourself,  and  who  also  knows  all  about  the 
world.  You  want  to  be  shielded  in  this  manner  from  the  stark  existential 
aloneness  of  individual  Being  and  its  attendant  responsibility.  This  is  all  very 
common  and  understandable.  But  you  suffer  because  you  are  truly  not  meant  to 
be  an  engineer. 

One  day  you  have  had  enough.  You  drop  out.  You  disappoint  your  parents. 
You  learn  to  live  with  that.  You  consult  only  yourself,  even  though  that  means 
you  must  rely  on  your  own  decisions.  You  take  a  philosophy  degree.  You  accept 
the  burden  of  your  own  mistakes.  You  become  your  own  person.  By  rejecting 
your  father’s  vision,  you  develop  your  own.  And  then,  as  your  parents  age, 
you’ve  become  adult  enough  to  be  there  for  them,  when  they  come  to  need  you. 
They  win,  too.  But  both  victories  had  to  be  purchased  at  the  cost  of  the  conflict 
engendered  by  your  truth.  As  Matthew  10:34  has  it,  citing  Christ — emphasizing 
the  role  of  the  spoken  Truth:  “Think  not  that  I  have  come  to  send  peace  on  earth: 
I  came  not  to  send  peace,  but  a  sword.” 


As  you  continue  to  live  in  accordance  with  the  truth,  as  it  reveals  itself  to  you, 
you  will  have  to  accept  and  deal  with  the  conflicts  that  mode  of  Being  will 
generate.  If  you  do  so,  you  will  continue  to  mature  and  become  more 
responsible,  in  small  ways  (don’t  underestimate  their  importance)  and  in  large. 
You  will  ever  more  closely  approach  your  newer  and  more  wisely  formulated 
goals,  and  become  even  wiser  in  their  formulation,  when  you  discover  and 
rectify  your  inevitable  errors.  Your  conception  of  what  is  important  will  become 
more  and  more  appropriate,  as  you  incorporate  the  wisdom  of  your  experience. 
You  will  quit  wildly  oscillating  and  walk  ever  more  directly  towards  the  good — a 
good  you  could  never  have  comprehended  if  you  had  insisted  despite  all 
evidence  that  you  were  right,  absolutely  right,  at  the  beginning. 

If  existence  is  good,  then  the  clearest  and  cleanest  and  most  correct 
relationship  with  it  is  also  good.  If  existence  is  not  good,  by  contrast,  you’re  lost. 
Nothing  will  save  you — certainly  not  the  petty  rebellions,  murky  thinking  and 
obscurantist  blindness  that  constitute  deceit.  Is  existence  good?  You  have  to  take 
a  terrible  risk  to  find  out.  Live  in  truth,  or  live  in  deceit,  face  the  consequences, 
and  draw  your  conclusions. 

This  is  the  “act  of  faith”  whose  necessity  was  insisted  upon  by  the  Danish 
philosopher  Kierkegaard.  You  cannot  know  ahead  of  time.  Even  a  good  example 
is  insufficient  for  proof,  given  the  differences  between  individuals.  The  success 
of  a  good  example  can  always  be  attributed  to  luck.  Thus,  you  have  to  risk  your 
particular,  individual  life  to  find  out.  It  is  this  risk  that  the  ancients  described  as 
the  sacrifice  of  personal  will  to  the  will  of  God.  It  is  not  an  act  of  submission  (at 
least  as  submission  is  currently  understood).  It  is  an  act  of  courage.  It  is  faith  that 
the  wind  will  blow  your  ship  to  a  new  and  better  port.  It  is  the  faith  that  Being 
can  be  corrected  by  becoming.  It  is  the  spirit  of  exploration  itself. 

Perhaps  it  is  better  to  conceptualize  it  this  way:  Everyone  needs  a  concrete, 
specific  goal — an  ambition,  and  a  purpose — to  limit  chaos  and  make  intelligible 
sense  of  his  or  her  life.  But  all  such  concrete  goals  can  and  should  be 
subordinated  to  what  might  be  considered  a  meta-goal,  which  is  a  way  of 
approaching  and  formulating  goals  themselves.  The  meta-goal  could  be  “live  in 
truth.”  This  means,  “Act  diligently  towards  some  well-articulated,  defined  and 
temporary  end.  Make  your  criteria  for  failure  and  success  timely  and  clear,  at 
least  for  yourself  (and  even  better  if  others  can  understand  what  you  are  doing 
and  evaluate  it  with  you).  While  doing  so,  however,  allow  the  world  and  your 
spirit  to  unfold  as  they  will,  while  you  act  out  and  articulate  the  truth.”  This  is 
both  pragmatic  ambition  and  the  most  courageous  of  faiths. 

Life  is  suffering.  The  Buddha  stated  that,  explicitly.  Christians  portray  the 
same  sentiment  imagistically,  with  the  divine  crucifix.  The  Jewish  faith  is 


saturated  with  its  remembrance.  The  equivalence  of  life  and  limitation  is  the 
primary  and  unavoidable  fact  of  existence.  The  vulnerability  of  our  Being 
renders  us  susceptible  to  the  pains  of  social  judgement  and  contempt  and  the 
inevitable  breakdown  of  our  bodies.  But  even  all  those  ways  of  suffering,  terrible 
as  they  are,  are  not  sufficient  to  corrupt  the  world,  to  transform  it  into  Hell,  the 
way  the  Nazis  and  the  Maoists  and  the  Stalinists  corrupted  the  world  and  turned 
it  into  Hell.  For  that,  as  Hitler  stated  so  clearly,  you  need  the  lie: 

[I]n  the  big  lie  there  is  always  a  certain  force  of  credibility;  because  the  broad  masses  of  a  nation 
are  always  more  easily  corrupted  in  the  deeper  strata  of  their  emotional  nature  than  consciously 
or  voluntarily;  and  thus  in  the  primitive  simplicity  of  their  minds  they  more  readily  fall  victims 
to  the  big  lie  than  the  small  lie,  since  they  themselves  often  tell  small  lies  in  little  matters  but 
would  be  ashamed  to  resort  to  large-scale  falsehoods.  It  would  never  come  into  their  heads  to 
fabricate  colossal  untmths,  and  they  would  not  believe  that  others  could  have  the  impudence  to 
distort  the  truth  so  infamously.  Even  though  the  facts  which  prove  this  to  be  so  may  be  brought 
clearly  to  their  minds,  they  will  still  doubt  and  waver  and  will  continue  to  think  that  there  may 
be  some  other  explanation. 

For  the  big  lie,  you  first  need  the  little  lie.  The  little  lie  is,  metaphorically 
speaking,  the  bait  used  by  the  Father  of  Lies  to  hook  his  victims.  The  human 
capacity  for  imagination  makes  us  capable  of  dreaming  up  and  creating 
alternative  worlds.  This  is  the  ultimate  source  of  our  creativity.  With  that 
singular  capacity,  however,  comes  the  counterpart,  the  opposite  side  of  the  coin: 
we  can  deceive  ourselves  and  others  into  believing  and  acting  as  if  things  are 
other  than  we  know  they  are. 

And  why  not  lie?  Why  not  twist  and  distort  things  to  obtain  a  small  gain,  or  to 
smooth  things  over,  or  to  keep  the  peace,  or  to  avoid  hurt  feelings?  Reality  has 
its  terrible  aspect:  do  we  really  need  to  confront  its  snake-headed  face  in  every 
moment  of  our  waking  consciousness,  and  at  every  turn  in  our  lives?  Why  not 
turn  away,  at  least,  when  looking  is  simply  too  painful? 

The  reason  is  simple.  Things  fall  apart.  What  worked  yesterday  will  not 
necessarily  work  today.  We  have  inherited  the  great  machinery  of  state  and 
culture  from  our  forefathers,  but  they  are  dead,  and  cannot  deal  with  the  changes 
of  the  day.  The  living  can.  We  can  open  our  eyes  and  modify  what  we  have 
where  necessary  and  keep  the  machinery  running  smoothly.  Or  we  can  pretend 
that  everything  is  alright,  fail  to  make  the  necessary  repairs,  and  then  curse  fate 
when  nothing  goes  our  way. 

Things  fall  apart:  this  is  one  of  the  great  discoveries  of  humanity.  And  we 
speed  the  natural  deterioration  of  great  things  through  blindness,  inaction  and 
deceit.  Without  attention,  culture  degenerates  and  dies,  and  evil  prevails. 

What  you  see  of  a  lie  when  you  act  it  out  (and  most  lies  are  acted  out,  rather 
than  told)  is  very  little  of  what  it  actually  is.  A  lie  is  connected  to  everything 


else.  It  produces  the  same  effect  on  the  world  that  a  single  drop  of  sewage 
produces  in  even  the  largest  crystal  magnum  of  champagne.  It  is  something  best 
considered  live  and  growing. 

When  the  lies  get  big  enough,  the  whole  world  spoils.  But  if  you  look  close 
enough,  the  biggest  of  lies  is  composed  of  smaller  lies,  and  those  are  composed 
of  still  smaller  lies — and  the  smallest  of  lies  is  where  the  big  lie  starts.  It  is  not 
the  mere  misstatement  of  fact.  It  is  instead  an  act  that  has  the  aspect  of  the  most 
serious  conspiracy  ever  to  possess  the  race  of  man.  Its  seeming  innocuousness, 
its  trivial  meanness,  the  feeble  arrogance  that  gives  rise  to  it,  the  apparently 
trivial  circumventing  of  responsibility  that  it  aims  at — these  all  work  effectively 
to  camouflage  its  true  nature,  its  genuine  dangerousness,  and  its  equivalence 
with  the  great  acts  of  evil  that  man  perpetrates  and  often  enjoys.  Lies  corrupt  the 
world.  Worse,  that  is  their  intent. 

First,  a  little  lie;  then,  several  little  lies  to  prop  it  up.  After  that,  distorted 
thinking  to  avoid  the  shame  that  those  lies  produce,  then  a  few  more  lies  to  cover 
up  the  consequences  of  the  distorted  thinking.  Then,  most  terribly,  the 
transformation  of  those  now  necessary  lies  through  practice  into  automatized, 
specialized,  structural,  neurologically  instantiated  “unconscious”  belief  and 
action.  Then  the  sickening  of  experience  itself  as  action  predicated  on  falsehood 
fails  to  produce  the  results  intended.  If  you  don’t  believe  in  brick  walls,  you  will 
still  be  injured  when  you  run  headlong  into  one.  Then  you  will  curse  reality  itself 
for  producing  the  wall. 

After  that  comes  the  arrogance  and  sense  of  superiority  that  inevitably 
accompanies  the  production  of  successful  lies  ( hypothetically  successful  lies — 
and  that  is  one  of  the  greatest  dangers:  apparently  everyone  is  fooled,  so 
everyone  is  stupid,  except  me.  Everyone  is  stupid  and  fooled,  by  me — so  I  can 
get  away  with  whatever  I  want).  Finally,  there  is  the  proposition:  “Being  itself  is 
susceptible  to  my  manipulations.  Thus,  it  deserves  no  respect.” 

That’s  things  falling  apart,  like  Osiris,  severed  into  pieces.  That’s  the  structure 
of  the  person  or  the  state  disintegrating  under  the  influence  of  a  malign  force. 
That’s  the  chaos  of  the  underworld  emerging,  like  a  flood,  to  subsume  familiar 
ground.  But  it’s  not  yet  Hell. 

Hell  comes  later.  Hell  comes  when  lies  have  destroyed  the  relationship 
between  individual  or  state  and  reality  itself.  Things  fall  apart.  Life  degenerates. 
Everything  becomes  frustration  and  disappointment.  Hope  consistently  betrays. 
The  deceitful  individual  desperately  gestures  at  sacrifice,  like  Cain,  but  fails  to 
please  God.  Then  the  drama  enters  its  final  act. 

Tortured  by  constant  failure,  the  individual  becomes  bitter.  Disappointment 
and  failure  amalgamate,  and  produce  a  fantasy:  the  world  is  bent  on  my  personal 


suffering,  my  particular  undoing,  my  destruction.  I  need,  I  deserve,  I  must  have 
— my  revenge.  That’s  the  gateway  to  Hell.  That’s  when  the  underworld,  a 
terrifying  and  unfamiliar  place,  becomes  misery  itself. 

At  the  beginning  of  time,  according  to  the  great  Western  tradition,  the  Word  of 
God  transformed  chaos  into  Being  through  the  act  of  speech.  It  is  axiomatic, 
within  that  tradition,  that  man  and  woman  alike  are  made  in  the  image  of  that 
God.  We  also  transform  chaos  into  Being,  through  speech.  We  transform  the 
manifold  possibilities  of  the  future  into  the  actualities  of  past  and  present. 

To  tell  the  truth  is  to  bring  the  most  habitable  reality  into  Being.  Truth  builds 
edifices  that  can  stand  a  thousand  years.  Truth  feeds  and  clothes  the  poor,  and 
makes  nations  wealthy  and  safe.  Tmth  reduces  the  terrible  complexity  of  a  man 
to  the  simplicity  of  his  word,  so  that  he  can  become  a  partner,  rather  than  an 
enemy.  Truth  makes  the  past  truly  past,  and  makes  the  best  use  of  the  future’s 
possibilities.  Truth  is  the  ultimate,  inexhaustible  natural  resource.  It’s  the  light  in 
the  darkness. 

See  the  truth.  Tell  the  truth. 

Truth  will  not  come  in  the  guise  of  opinions  shared  by  others,  as  the  tmth  is 
neither  a  collection  of  slogans  nor  an  ideology.  It  will  instead  be  personal.  Your 
truth  is  something  only  you  can  tell,  based  as  it  is  on  the  unique  circumstances  of 
your  life.  Apprehend  your  personal  truth.  Communicate  it  carefully,  in  an 
articulate  manner,  to  yourself  and  others.  This  will  ensure  your  security  and  your 
life  more  abundantly  now,  while  you  inhabit  the  structure  of  your  current  beliefs. 
This  will  ensure  the  benevolence  of  the  future,  diverging  as  it  might  from  the 
certainties  of  the  past. 

The  truth  springs  forth  ever  anew  from  the  most  profound  wellsprings  of 
Being.  It  will  keep  your  soul  from  withering  and  dying  while  you  encounter  the 
inevitable  tragedy  of  life.  It  will  help  you  avoid  the  terrible  desire  to  seek 
vengeance  for  that  tragedy — part  of  the  terrible  sin  of  Being,  which  everything 
must  bear  gracefully,  just  so  it  can  exist. 

If  your  life  is  not  what  it  could  be,  try  telling  the  truth.  If  you  cling  desperately 
to  an  ideology,  or  wallow  in  nihilism,  try  telling  the  truth.  If  you  feel  weak  and 
rejected,  and  desperate,  and  confused,  try  telling  the  truth.  In  Paradise,  everyone 
speaks  the  truth.  That  is  what  makes  it  Paradise. 

Tell  the  truth.  Or,  at  least,  don’t  lie. 


RULE  9 


ASSUME  THAT  THE  PERSON  YOU  ARE  LISTENING  TO 
MIGHT  KNOW  SOMETHING  YOU  DON’T 

NOT  ADVICE 

Psychotherapy  is  not  advice.  Advice  is  what  you  get  when  the  person  you’re 
talking  with  about  something  horrible  and  complicated  wishes  you  would  just 
shut  up  and  go  away.  Advice  is  what  you  get  when  the  person  you  are  talking  to 
wants  to  revel  in  the  superiority  of  his  or  her  own  intelligence.  If  you  weren’t  so 
stupid,  after  all,  you  wouldn’t  have  your  stupid  problems. 

Psychotherapy  is  genuine  conversation.  Genuine  conversation  is  exploration, 
articulation  and  strategizing.  When  you’re  involved  in  a  genuine  conversation, 
you’re  listening,  and  talking — but  mostly  listening.  Listening  is  paying  attention. 
It’s  amazing  what  people  will  tell  you  if  you  listen.  Sometimes  if  you  listen  to 
people  they  will  even  tell  you  what’s  wrong  with  them.  Sometimes  they  will 
even  tell  you  how  they  plan  to  fix  it.  Sometimes  that  helps  you  fix  something 
wrong  with  yourself.  One  surprising  time  (and  this  is  only  one  occasion  of  many 
when  such  things  happened),  I  was  listening  to  someone  very  carefully,  and  she 
told  me  within  minutes  (a)  that  she  was  a  witch  and  (b)  that  her  witch  coven 
spent  a  lot  of  its  time  visualizing  world  peace  together.  She  was  a  long-time 
lower-level  functionary  in  some  bureaucratic  job.  I  would  never  have  guessed 
that  she  was  a  witch.  I  also  didn’t  know  that  witch  covens  spent  any  of  their  time 
visualizing  world  peace.  I  didn’t  know  what  to  make  of  any  of  it,  either,  but  it 
wasn’t  boring,  and  that’s  something. 

In  my  clinical  practice,  I  talk  and  I  listen.  I  talk  more  to  some  people,  and 
listen  more  to  others.  Many  of  the  people  I  listen  to  have  no  one  else  to  talk  to. 
Some  of  them  are  truly  alone  in  the  world.  There  are  far  more  people  like  that 
than  you  think.  You  don’t  meet  them,  because  they  are  alone.  Others  are 
surrounded  by  tyrants  or  narcissists  or  drunks  or  traumatized  people  or 
professional  victims.  Some  are  not  good  at  articulating  themselves.  They  go  off 
on  tangents.  They  repeat  themselves.  They  say  vague  and  contradictory  things. 
They’re  hard  to  listen  to.  Others  have  terrible  things  happening  around  them. 
They  have  parents  with  Alzheimer’s  or  sick  children.  There’s  not  much  time  left 
over  for  their  personal  concerns. 

One  time  a  client  who  I  had  been  seeing  for  a  few  months  came  into  my 
office  tal  for  her  scheduled  appointment  and,  after  some  brief  preliminaries,  she 


announced  “I  think  I  was  raped.”  It  is  not  easy  to  know  how  to  respond  to  a 
statement  like  that,  although  there  is  frequently  some  mystery  around  such 
events.  Often  alcohol  is  involved,  as  it  is  in  most  sexual  assault  cases.  Alcohol 
can  cause  ambiguity.  That’s  partly  why  people  drink.  Alcohol  temporarily  lifts 
the  terrible  burden  of  self-consciousness  from  people.  Drunk  people  know  about 
the  future,  but  they  don’t  care  about  it.  That’s  exciting.  That’s  exhilarating. 
Drunk  people  can  party  like  there’s  no  tomorrow.  But,  because  there  is  a 
tomorrow — most  of  the  time — drunk  people  also  get  in  trouble.  They  black  out. 
They  go  to  dangerous  places  with  careless  people.  They  have  fun.  But  they  also 
get  raped.  So,  I  immediately  thought  something  like  that  might  be  involved. 

How  else  to  understand  “I  think”?  But  that  wasn’t  the  end  of  the  story.  She 
added  an  extra  detail:  “Five  times.”  The  first  sentence  was  awful  enough,  but  the 
second  produced  something  unfathomable.  Five  times?  What  could  that  possibly 
mean? 

My  client  told  me  that  she  would  go  to  a  bar  and  have  a  few  drinks.  Someone 
would  start  to  talk  with  her.  She  would  end  up  at  his  place  or  her  place  with  him. 
The  evening  would  proceed,  inevitably,  to  its  sexual  climax.  The  next  day  she 
would  wake  up,  uncertain  about  what  happened — uncertain  about  her  motives, 
uncertain  about  his  motives,  and  uncertain  about  the  world.  Miss  S,  we’ll  call 
her,  was  vague  to  the  point  of  non-existence.  She  was  a  ghost  of  a  person.  She 
dressed,  however,  like  a  professional.  She  knew  how  to  present  herself,  for  first 
appearances.  In  consequence,  she  had  finagled  her  way  onto  a  government 
advisory  board  considering  the  construction  of  a  major  piece  of  transportation 
infrastructure  (even  though  she  knew  nothing  about  government,  advising  or 
construction).  She  also  hosted  a  local  public-access  radio  show  dedicated  to 
small  business,  even  though  she  had  never  held  a  real  job,  and  knew  nothing 
about  being  an  entrepreneur.  She  had  been  receiving  welfare  payments  for  the 
entirety  of  her  adulthood. 

Her  parents  had  never  provided  her  with  a  minute  of  attention.  She  had  four 
brothers  and  they  were  not  at  all  good  to  her.  She  had  no  friends  now,  and  none 
in  the  past.  She  had  no  partner.  She  had  no  one  to  talk  to,  and  she  didn’t  know 
how  to  think  on  her  own  (that’s  not  rare).  She  had  no  self.  She  was,  instead,  a 
walking  cacophony  of  unintegrated  experiences.  I  had  tried  previously  to  help 
her  find  a  job.  I  asked  her  if  she  had  a  CV.  She  said  yes.  I  asked  her  to  bring  it  to 
me.  She  brought  it  to  our  next  session.  It  was  fifty  pages  long.  It  was  in  a  file 
folder  box,  divided  into  sections,  with  manila  tag  separators — the  ones  with  the 
little  colorful  index-markers  on  the  sides.  The  sections  included  such  topics  as 
“My  Dreams”  and  “Books  I  Have  Read.”  She  had  written  down  dozens  of  her 
night-time  dreams  in  the  “My  Dreams”  section,  and  provided  brief  summaries 


and  reviews  of  her  reading  material.  This  was  what  she  proposed  to  send  to 
prospective  employers  (or  perhaps  already  had:  who  really  knew?).  It  is 
impossible  to  understand  how  much  someone  has  to  be  no  one  at  all  to  exist  in  a 
world  where  a  file  folder  box  containing  fifty  indexed  pages  listing  dreams  and 
novels  constitutes  a  CV.  Miss  S  knew  nothing  about  herself.  She  knew  nothing 
about  other  individuals.  She  knew  nothing  about  the  world.  She  was  a  movie 
played  out  of  focus.  And  she  was  desperately  waiting  for  a  story  about  herself  to 
make  it  all  make  sense. 

If  you  add  some  sugar  to  cold  water,  and  stir  it,  the  sugar  will  dissolve.  If  you 
heat  up  that  water,  you  can  dissolve  more.  If  you  heat  the  water  to  boiling,  you 
can  add  a  lot  more  sugar  and  get  that  to  dissolve  too.  Then,  if  you  take  that 
boiling  sugar  water,  and  slowly  cool  it,  and  don’t  bump  it  or  jar  it,  you  can  trick 
it  (I  don’t  know  how  else  to  phrase  this)  into  holding  a  lot  more  dissolved  sugar 
than  it  would  have  it  if  it  had  remained  cold  all  along.  That’s  called  a  super¬ 
saturated  solution.  If  you  drop  a  single  crystal  of  sugar  into  that  super-saturated 
solution,  all  the  excess  sugar  will  suddenly  and  dramatically  crystallize.  It’s  as  if 
it  were  crying  out  for  order.  That  was  my  client.  People  like  her  are  the  reason 
that  the  many  forms  of  psychotherapy  currently  practised  all  work.  People  can 
be  so  confused  that  their  psyches  will  be  ordered  and  their  lives  improved  by  the 
adoption  of  any  reasonably  orderly  system  of  interpretation.  This  is  the  bringing 
together  of  the  disparate  elements  of  their  lives  in  a  disciplined  manner — any 
disciplined  manner.  So,  if  you  have  come  apart  at  the  seams  (or  if  you  never 
have  been  together  at  all)  you  can  restructure  your  life  on  Freudian,  Jungian, 
Adlerian,  Rogerian  or  behavioural  principles.  At  least  then  you  make  sense.  At 
least  then  you’re  coherent.  At  least  then  you  might  be  good  for  something,  if  not 
good  yet  for  everything.  You  can’t  fix  a  car  with  an  axe,  but  you  can  cut  down  a 
tree.  That’s  still  something. 

At  about  the  same  time  I  was  seeing  this  client,  the  media  was  all  afire  with 
stories  of  recovered  memories — particularly  of  sexual  assault.  The  dispute  raged 
apace:  were  these  genuine  accounts  of  past  trauma?  Or  were  they  post-hoc 
constructs,  dreamed  up  as  a  consequence  of  pressure  wittingly  or  unwittingly 
applied  by  incautious  therapists,  grasped  onto  desperately  by  clinical  clients  all- 
too-eager  to  find  a  simple  cause  for  all  their  trouble?  Sometimes,  it  was  the 
former,  perhaps;  and  sometimes  the  latter.  I  understood  much  more  clearly  and 
precisely,  however,  how  easy  it  might  be  to  instill  a  false  memory  into  the  mental 
landscape  as  soon  as  my  client  revealed  her  uncertainty  about  her  sexual 
experiences.  The  past  appears  fixed,  but  it’s  not — not  in  an  important 
psychological  sense.  There  is  an  awful  lot  to  the  past,  after  all,  and  the  way  we 
organize  it  can  be  subject  to  drastic  revision. 


Imagine,  for  example,  a  movie  where  nothing  but  terrible  things  happen.  But, 
in  the  end,  everything  works  out.  Everything  is  resolved.  A  sufficiently  happy 
ending  can  change  the  meaning  of  all  the  previous  events.  They  can  all  be 
viewed  as  worthwhile,  given  that  ending.  Now  imagine  another  movie.  A  lot  of 
things  are  happening.  They’re  all  exciting  and  interesting.  But  there  are  a  lot  of 
them.  Ninety  minutes  in,  you  start  to  worry.  “This  is  a  great  movie,”  you  think, 
“but  there  are  a  lot  of  things  going  on.  I  sure  hope  the  filmmaker  can  pull  it  all 
together.”  But  that  doesn’t  happen.  Instead,  the  story  ends,  abruptly,  unresolved, 
or  something  facile  and  cliched  occurs.  You  leave  deeply  annoyed  and 
unsatisfied — failing  to  notice  that  you  were  fully  engaged  and  enjoying  the 
movie  almost  the  whole  time  you  were  in  the  theatre.  The  present  can  change  the 
past,  and  the  future  can  change  the  present. 

When  you  are  remembering  the  past,  as  well,  you  remember  some  parts  of  it 
and  forget  others.  You  have  clear  memories  of  some  things  that  happened,  but 
not  others,  of  potentially  equal  import — just  as  in  the  present  you  are  aware  of 
some  aspects  of  your  surroundings  and  unconscious  of  others.  You  categorize 
your  experience,  grouping  some  elements  together,  and  separating  them  from  the 
rest.  There  is  a  mysterious  arbitrariness  about  all  of  this.  You  don’t  form  a 
comprehensive,  objective  record.  You  can’t.  You  just  don’t  know  enough.  You 
just  can’t  perceive  enough.  You’re  not  objective,  either.  You’re  alive.  You’re 
subjective.  You  have  vested  interests — at  least  in  yourself,  at  least  usually.  What 
exactly  should  be  included  in  the  story?  Where  exactly  is  the  border  between 
events? 

The  sexual  abuse  of  children  is  distressingly  common.  However,  it’s  not  as 
common  as  poorly  trained  psychotherapists  think,  and  it  also  does  not  always 
produce  terribly  damaged  adults.  People  vary  in  their  resilience.  An  event  that 
will  wipe  one  person  out  can  be  shrugged  off  by  another.  But  therapists  with  a 
little  second-hand  knowledge  of  Freud  often  axiomatically  assume  that  a 
distressed  adult  in  their  practice  must  have  been  subject  to  childhood  sexual 
abuse.  Why  else  would  they  be  distressed?  So,  they  dig,  and  infer,  and  intimate, 
and  suggest,  and  overreact,  and  bias  and  tilt.  They  exaggerate  the  importance  of 
some  events,  and  downplay  the  importance  of  others.  They  trim  the  facts  to  fit 
their  theory.  And  they  convince  their  clients  that  they  were  sexually  abused — 
if  they  could  only  remember.  And  then  the  clients  start  to  remember.  And  then 
they  start  to  accuse.  And  sometimes  what  they  remember  never  happened,  and 
the  people  accused  are  innocent.  The  good  news?  At  least  the  therapist’s  theory 
remains  intact.  That’s  good — for  the  therapist.  But  there’s  no  shortage  of 


collateral  damage.  However,  people  are  often  willing  to  produce  a  lot  of 
collateral  damage  if  they  can  retain  their  theory. 

I  knew  about  all  this  when  Miss  S  came  to  talk  to  me  about  her  sexual 
experiences.  When  she  recounted  her  trips  to  the  singles  bars,  and  their  recurring 
aftermath,  I  thought  a  bunch  of  things  at  once.  I  thought,  “You’re  so  vague  and 
so  non-existent.  You’re  a  denizen  of  chaos  and  the  underworld.  You  are  going 
ten  different  places  at  the  same  time.  Anyone  can  take  you  by  the  hand  and  guide 
you  down  the  road  of  their  choosing.”  After  all,  if  you’re  not  the  leading  man  in 
your  own  drama,  you’re  a  bit  player  in  someone  else’s — and  you  might  well  be 
assigned  to  play  a  dismal,  lonely  and  tragic  part.  After  Miss  S  recounted  her 
story,  we  sat  there.  I  thought,  “You  have  normal  sexual  desires.  You’re  extremely 
lonely.  You’re  unfulfilled  sexually.  You’re  afraid  of  men  and  ignorant  of  the 
world  and  know  nothing  of  yourself.  You  wander  around  like  an  accident 
waiting  to  happen  and  the  accident  happens  and  that’s  your  life.” 

I  thought,  “Part  of  you  wants  to  be  taken.  Part  of  you  wants  to  be  a  child.  You 
were  abused  by  your  brothers  and  ignored  by  your  father  and  so  part  of  you 
wants  revenge  upon  men.  Part  of  you  is  guilty.  Another  part  is  ashamed.  Another 
part  is  thrilled  and  excited.  Who  are  you?  What  did  you  do?  What  happened?” 
What  was  the  objective  truth?  There  was  no  way  of  knowing  the  objective  truth. 
And  there  never  would  be.  There  was  no  objective  observer,  and  there  never 
would  be.  There  was  no  complete  and  accurate  story.  Such  a  thing  did  not  and 
could  not  exist.  There  were,  and  are,  only  partial  accounts  and  fragmentary 
viewpoints.  But  some  are  still  better  than  others.  Memory  is  not  a  description  of 
the  objective  past.  Memory  is  a  tool.  Memory  is  the  past’s  guide  to  the  future.  If 
you  remember  that  something  bad  happened,  and  you  can  figure  out  why,  then 
you  can  try  to  avoid  that  bad  thing  happening  again.  That’s  the  purpose  of 
memory.  It’s  not  “to  remember  the  past.”  It’s  to  stop  the  same  damn  thing  from 
happening  over  and  over. 

I  thought,  “I  could  simplify  Miss  S’s  life.  I  could  say  that  her  suspicions  of 
rape  were  fully  justified,  and  that  her  doubt  about  the  events  was  nothing  but 
additional  evidence  of  her  thorough  and  long-term  victimization.  I  could  insist 
that  her  sexual  partners  had  a  legal  obligation  to  ensure  that  she  was  not  too 
impaired  by  alcohol  to  give  consent.  I  could  tell  her  that  she  had  indisputably 
been  subject  to  violent  and  illicit  acts,  unless  she  had  consented  to  each  sexual 
move  explicitly  and  verbally.  I  could  tell  her  that  she  was  an  innocent  victim.”  I 
could  have  told  her  all  that.  And  it  would  have  been  true.  And  she  would  have 
accepted  it  as  true,  and  remembered  it  for  the  rest  of  her  life.  She  would  have 
been  a  new  person,  with  a  new  history,  and  a  new  destiny. 


But  I  also  thought,  “I  could  tell  Miss  S  that  she  is  a  walking  disaster.  I  could 
tell  her  that  she  wanders  into  a  bar  like  a  courtesan  in  a  coma,  that  she  is  a 
danger  to  herself  and  others,  that  she  needs  to  wake  up,  and  that  if  she  goes  to 
singles  bars  and  drinks  too  much  and  is  taken  home  and  has  rough  violent  sex 
(or  even  tender  caring  sex),  then  what  the  hell  does  she  expect?”  In  other  words, 

I  could  have  told  her,  in  more  philosophical  terms,  that  she  was  Nietzsche’s 
“pale  criminal” — the  person  who  at  one  moment  dares  to  break  the  sacred  law 
and  at  the  next  shrinks  from  paying  the  price.  And  that  would  have  been  tme, 
too,  and  she  would  have  accepted  it  as  such,  and  remembered  it. 

If  I  had  been  the  adherent  of  a  left-wing,  social-justice  ideology,  I  would  have 
told  her  the  first  story.  If  I  had  been  the  adherent  of  a  conservative  ideology,  I 
would  have  told  her  the  second.  And  her  responses  after  having  been  told  either 
the  first  or  the  second  story  would  have  proved  to  my  satisfaction  and  hers  that 
the  story  I  had  told  her  was  true — completely,  irrefutably  true.  And  that  would 
have  been  advice. 

Figure  It  Out  for  Yourself 

I  decided  instead  to  listen.  I  have  learned  not  to  steal  my  clients’  problems  from 
them.  I  don’t  want  to  be  the  redeeming  hero  or  the  deus  ex  machina — not  in 
someone  else’s  story.  I  don’t  want  their  lives.  So,  I  asked  her  to  tell  me  what  she 
thought,  and  I  listened.  She  talked  a  lot.  When  we  were  finished,  she  still  didn’t 
know  if  she  had  been  raped,  and  neither  did  I.  Life  is  very  complicated. 

Sometimes  you  have  to  change  the  way  you  understand  everything  to  properly 
understand  a  single  something.  “Was  I  raped?”  can  be  a  very  complicated 
question.  The  mere  fact  that  the  question  would  present  itself  in  that  form 
indicates  the  existence  of  infinite  layers  of  complexity — to  say  nothing  of  “five 
times.”  There  are  a  myriad  of  questions  hidden  inside  “Was  I  raped?”:  What  is 
rape?  What  is  consent?  What  constitutes  appropriate  sexual  caution?  How 
should  a  person  defend  herself?  Where  does  the  fault  lie?  “Was  I  raped?”  is  a 
hydra.  If  you  cut  off  the  head  of  a  hydra,  seven  more  grow.  That’s  life.  Miss  S 
would  have  had  to  talk  for  twenty  years  to  figure  out  whether  she  had  been 
raped.  And  someone  would  have  had  to  be  there  to  listen.  I  started  the  process, 
but  circumstances  made  it  impossible  for  me  to  finish.  She  left  therapy  with  me 
only  somewhat  less  ill-formed  and  vague  than  when  she  first  met  me.  But  at 
least  she  didn’t  leave  as  the  living  embodiment  of  my  damned  ideology. 

The  people  I  listen  to  need  to  talk,  because  that’s  how  people  think.  People 
need  to  think.  Otherwise  they  wander  blindly  into  pits.  When  people  think,  they 
simulate  the  world,  and  plan  how  to  act  in  it.  If  they  do  a  good  job  of  simulating, 


they  can  figure  out  what  stupid  things  they  shouldn’t  do.  Then  they  can  not  do 
them.  Then  they  don’t  have  to  suffer  the  consequences.  That’s  the  purpose  of 
thinking.  But  we  can’t  do  it  alone.  We  simulate  the  world,  and  plan  our  actions  in 
it.  Only  human  beings  do  this.  That’s  how  brilliant  we  are.  We  make  little  avatars 
of  ourselves.  We  place  those  avatars  in  fictional  worlds.  Then  we  watch  what 
happens.  If  our  avatar  thrives,  then  we  act  like  he  does,  in  the  real  world.  Then 
we  thrive  (we  hope).  If  our  avatar  fails,  we  don’t  go  there,  if  we  have  any  sense. 
We  let  him  die  in  the  fictional  world,  so  that  we  don’t  have  to  really  die  in  the 
present. 

Imagine  two  children  talking.  The  younger  one  says,  “Wouldn’t  it  be  fun  to 
climb  up  on  the  roof?”  He  has  just  placed  a  little  avatar  of  himself  in  a  fictional 
world.  But  his  older  sister  objects.  She  chimes  in.  “That’s  stupid,”  she  says. 
“What  if  you  fall  off  the  roof?  What  if  Dad  catches  you?”  The  younger  child  can 
then  modify  the  original  simulation,  draw  the  appropriate  conclusion,  and  let  the 
whole  fictional  world  wither  on  the  vine.  Or  not.  Maybe  the  risk  is  worth  it.  But 
at  least  now  it  can  be  factored  in.  The  fictional  world  is  a  bit  more  complete,  and 
the  avatar  a  bit  wiser. 

People  think  they  think,  but  it’s  not  true.  It’s  mostly  self-criticism  that  passes 
for  thinking.  True  thinking  is  rare — just  like  true  listening.  Thinking  is  listening 
to  yourself.  It’s  difficult.  To  think,  you  have  to  be  at  least  two  people  at  the  same 
time.  Then  you  have  to  let  those  people  disagree.  Thinking  is  an  internal 
dialogue  between  two  or  more  different  views  of  the  world.  Viewpoint  One  is  an 
avatar  in  a  simulated  world.  It  has  its  own  representations  of  past,  present  and 
future,  and  its  own  ideas  about  how  to  act.  So  do  Viewpoints  Two,  and  Three, 
and  Four.  Thinking  is  the  process  by  which  these  internal  avatars  imagine  and 
articulate  their  worlds  to  one  another.  You  can’t  set  straw  men  against  one 
another  when  you’re  thinking,  either,  because  then  you’re  not  thinking.  You’re 
rationalizing,  post-hoc.  You’re  matching  what  you  want  against  a  weak  opponent 
so  that  you  don’t  have  to  change  your  mind.  You’re  propagandizing.  You’re 
using  double-speak.  You’re  using  your  conclusions  to  justify  your  proofs.  You’re 
hiding  from  the  truth. 

True  thinking  is  complex  and  demanding.  It  requires  you  to  be  articulate 
speaker  and  careful,  judicious  listener,  at  the  same  time.  It  involves  conflict.  So, 
you  have  to  tolerate  conflict.  Conflict  involves  negotiation  and  compromise.  So, 
you  have  to  learn  to  give  and  take  and  to  modify  your  premises  and  adjust  your 
thoughts — even  your  perceptions  of  the  world.  Sometimes  it  results  in  the  defeat 
and  elimination  of  one  or  more  internal  avatar.  They  don’t  like  to  be  defeated  or 
eliminated,  either.  They’re  hard  to  build.  They’re  valuable.  They’re  alive.  They 
like  to  stay  alive.  They’ll  fight  to  stay  alive.  You  better  listen  to  them.  If  you 


don’t  they’ll  go  underground  and  turn  into  devils  and  torture  you.  In 
consequence,  thinking  is  emotionally  painful,  as  well  as  physiologically 
demanding;  more  so  than  anything  else — except  not  thinking.  But  you  have  to  be 
very  articulate  and  sophisticated  to  have  all  of  this  occur  inside  your  own  head. 
What  are  you  to  do,  then,  if  you  aren’t  very  good  at  thinking,  at  being  two  people 
at  one  time?  That’s  easy.  You  talk.  But  you  need  someone  to  listen.  A  listening 
person  is  your  collaborator  and  your  opponent. 

A  listening  person  tests  your  talking  (and  your  thinking)  without  having  to  say 
anything.  A  listening  person  is  a  representative  of  common  humanity.  He  stands 
for  the  crowd.  Now  the  crowd  is  by  no  means  always  right,  but  it’s  commonly 
right.  It’s  typically  right.  If  you  say  something  that  takes  everyone  aback, 
therefore,  you  should  reconsider  what  you  said.  I  say  that,  knowing  full  well  that 
controversial  opinions  are  sometimes  correct — sometimes  so  much  so  that  the 
crowd  will  perish  if  it  refuses  to  listen.  It  is  for  this  reason,  among  others,  that 
the  individual  is  morally  obliged  to  stand  up  and  tell  the  truth  of  his  or  her  own 
experience.  But  something  new  and  radical  is  still  almost  always  wrong.  You 
need  good,  even  great,  reasons  to  ignore  or  defy  general,  public  opinion.  That’s 
your  culture.  It’s  a  mighty  oak.  You  perch  on  one  of  its  branches.  If  the  branch 
breaks,  it’s  a  long  way  down — farther,  perhaps,  than  you  think.  If  you’re  reading 
this  book,  there’s  a  strong  probability  that  you’re  a  privileged  person.  You  can 
read.  You  have  time  to  read.  You’re  perched  high  in  the  clouds.  It  took  untold 
generations  to  get  you  where  you  are.  A  little  gratitude  might  be  in  order.  If 
you’re  going  to  insist  on  bending  the  world  to  your  way,  you  better  have  your 
reasons.  If  you’re  going  to  stand  your  ground,  you  better  have  your  reasons.  You 
better  have  thought  them  through.  You  might  otherwise  be  in  for  a  very  hard 
landing.  You  should  do  what  other  people  do,  unless  you  have  a  very  good 
reason  not  to.  If  you’re  in  a  rut,  at  least  you  know  that  other  people  have 
travelled  that  path.  Out  of  the  rut  is  too  often  off  the  road.  And  in  the  desert  that 
awaits  off  the  road  there  are  highwaymen  and  monsters. 

So  speaks  wisdom. 

A  Listening  Person 

A  listening  person  can  reflect  the  crowd.  He  can  do  that  without  talking.  He  can 
do  that  merely  by  letting  the  talking  person  listen  to  himself.  That  is  what  Freud 
recommended.  He  had  his  patients  lay  on  a  couch,  look  at  the  ceiling,  let  their 
minds  wander,  and  say  whatever  wandered  in.  That’s  his  method  of  free 
association.  That’s  the  way  the  Freudian  psychoanalyst  avoids  transferring  his  or 
her  own  personal  biases  and  opinions  into  the  internal  landscape  of  the  patient.  It 


was  for  such  reasons  that  Freud  did  not  face  his  patients.  He  did  not  want  their 
spontaneous  meditations  to  be  altered  by  his  emotional  expressions,  no  matter 
how  slight.  He  was  properly  concerned  that  his  own  opinions — and,  worse,  his 
own  unresolved  problems — would  find  themselves  uncontrollably  reflected  in 
his  responses  and  reactions,  conscious  and  unconscious  alike.  He  was  afraid  that 
he  would  in  such  a  manner  detrimentally  affect  the  development  of  his  patients. 

It  was  for  such  reasons,  as  well,  that  Freud  insisted  that  psychoanalysts  be 
analyzed  themselves.  He  wanted  those  who  practiced  his  method  to  uncover  and 
eliminate  some  of  their  own  worst  blind  spots  and  prejudices,  so  they  would  not 
practise  corruptly.  Freud  had  a  point.  He  was,  after  all,  a  genius.  You  can  tell  that 
because  people  still  hate  him.  But  there  are  disadvantages  to  the  detached  and 
somewhat  distant  approach  recommended  by  Freud.  Many  of  those  who  seek 
therapy  desire  and  need  a  closer,  more  personal  relationship  (although  that  also 
has  its  dangers).  This  is  in  part  why  I  have  opted  in  my  practice  for  the 
conversation,  instead  of  the  Freudian  method — as  have  most  clinical 
psychologists. 

It  can  be  worthwhile  for  my  clients  to  see  my  reactions.  To  protect  them  from 
the  undue  influence  that  might  produce,  I  attempt  to  set  my  aim  properly,  so  that 
my  responses  emerge  from  the  appropriate  motivation.  I  do  what  I  can  to  want 
the  best  for  them  (whatever  that  might  be).  I  do  my  best  to  want  the  best,  period, 
as  well  (because  that  is  part  of  wanting  the  best  for  my  clients).  I  try  to  clear  my 
mind,  and  to  leave  my  own  concerns  aside.  That  way  I  am  concentrating  on  what 
is  best  for  my  clients,  while  I  am  simultaneously  alert  to  any  cues  that  I  might  be 
misunderstanding  what  that  best  is.  That’s  something  that  has  to  be  negotiated, 
not  assumed  on  my  part.  It’s  something  that  has  to  be  managed  very  carefully,  to 
mitigate  the  risks  of  close,  personal  interaction.  My  clients  talk.  I  listen. 
Sometimes  I  respond.  Often  the  response  is  subtle.  It’s  not  even  verbal.  My 
clients  and  I  face  each  other.  We  make  eye  contact.  We  can  see  each  other’s 
expressions.  They  can  observe  the  effects  of  their  words  on  me,  and  I  can 
observe  the  effects  of  mine  on  them.  They  can  respond  to  my  responses. 

A  client  of  mine  might  say,  “I  hate  my  wife.”  It’s  out  there,  once  said.  It’s 
hanging  in  the  air.  It  has  emerged  from  the  underworld,  materialized  from  chaos, 
and  manifested  itself.  It  is  perceptible  and  concrete  and  no  longer  easily  ignored. 
It’s  become  real.  The  speaker  has  even  startled  himself.  He  sees  the  same  thing 
reflected  in  my  eyes.  He  notes  that,  and  continues  on  the  road  to  sanity.  “Hold 
it,”  he  says.  “Back  up.  That’s  too  harsh.  Sometimes  I  hate  my  wife.  I  hate  her 
when  she  won’t  tell  me  what  she  wants.  My  mom  did  that  all  the  time,  too.  It 
drove  Dad  crazy.  It  drove  all  of  us  crazy,  to  tell  you  the  truth.  It  even  drove  Mom 
crazy!  She  was  a  nice  person,  but  she  was  very  resentful.  Well,  at  least  my  wife 


isn’t  as  bad  as  my  mother.  Not  at  all.  Wait!  I  guess  my  wife  is  actually  pretty 
good  at  telling  me  what  she  wants,  but  I  get  really  bothered  when  she  doesn’t, 
because  Mom  tortured  us  all  half  to  death  being  a  martyr.  That  really  affected 
me.  Maybe  I  overreact  now  when  it  happens  even  a  bit.  Hey!  I’m  acting  just  like 
Dad  did  when  Mom  upset  him!  That  isn’t  me.  That  doesn’t  have  anything  to  do 
with  my  wife!  I  better  let  her  know.”  I  observe  from  all  this  that  my  client  had 
failed  previously  to  properly  distinguish  his  wife  from  his  mother.  And  I  see  that 
he  was  possessed,  unconsciously,  by  the  spirit  of  his  father.  He  sees  all  of  that 
too.  Now  he  is  a  bit  more  differentiated,  a  bit  less  an  uncarved  block,  a  bit  less 
hidden  in  the  fog.  He  has  sewed  up  a  small  tear  in  the  fabric  of  his  culture.  He 
says,  “That  was  a  good  session,  Dr.  Peterson.”  I  nod.  You  can  be  pretty  smart  if 
you  can  just  shut  up. 

I’m  a  collaborator  and  opponent  even  when  I’m  not  talking.  I  can’t  help  it.  My 
expressions  broadcast  my  response,  even  when  they’re  subtle.  So,  I’m 
communicating,  as  Freud  so  rightly  stressed,  even  when  silent.  But  I  also  talk  in 
my  clinical  sessions.  How  do  I  know  when  to  say  something?  First,  as  I  said,  I 
put  myself  in  the  proper  frame  of  mind.  I  aim  properly.  I  want  things  to  be  better. 
My  mind  orients  itself,  given  this  goal.  It  tries  to  produce  responses  to  the 
therapeutic  dialogue  that  furthers  that  aim.  I  watch  what  happens,  internally.  I 
reveal  my  responses.  That’s  the  first  rule.  Sometimes,  for  example,  a  client  will 
say  something,  and  a  thought  will  occur  to  me,  or  a  fantasy  flit  through  my  mind. 
Frequently  it’s  about  something  that  was  said  by  the  same  client  earlier  that  day, 
or  during  a  previous  session.  Then  I  tell  my  client  that  thought  or  fantasy. 
Disinterestedly.  I  say,  “You  said  this  and  I  noticed  that  I  then  became  aware  of 
this.”  Then  we  discuss  it.  We  try  to  determine  the  relevance  of  meaning  of  my 
reaction.  Sometimes,  perhaps,  it’s  about  me.  That  was  Freud’s  point.  But 
sometimes  it  is  just  the  reaction  of  a  detached  but  positively  inclined  human 
being  to  a  personally  revealing  statement  by  another  human  being.  It’s 
meaningful — sometimes,  even,  corrective.  Sometimes,  however,  it’s  me  that  gets 
corrected. 

You  have  to  get  along  with  other  people.  A  therapist  is  one  of  those  other 
people.  A  good  therapist  will  tell  you  the  truth  about  what  he  thinks.  (That  is  not 
the  same  thing  as  telling  you  that  what  he  thinks  is  the  truth.)  Then  at  least  you 
have  the  honest  opinion  of  at  least  one  person.  That’s  not  so  easy  to  get.  That’s 
not  nothing.  That’s  key  to  the  psychotherapeutic  process:  two  people  tell  each 
other  the  truth — and  both  listen. 


How  Should  You  Listen? 


Carl  Rogers,  one  of  the  twentieth  century’s  great  psychotherapists,  knew 
something  about  listening.  He  wrote,  “The  great  majority  of  us  cannot  listen;  we 
find  ourselves  compelled  to  evaluate,  because  listening  is  too  dangerous.  The 
first  requirement  is  courage,  and  we  do  not  always  have  it.”  He  knew  that 
listening  could  transform  people.  On  that,  Rogers  commented,  “Some  of  you 
may  be  feeling  that  you  listen  well  to  people,  and  that  you  have  never  seen  such 
results.  The  chances  are  very  great  indeed  that  your  listening  has  not  been  of  the 
type  I  have  described.”  He  suggested  that  his  readers  conduct  a  short  experiment 
when  they  next  found  themselves  in  a  dispute:  “Stop  the  discussion  for  a 
moment,  and  institute  this  rule:  ‘Each  person  can  speak  up  for  himself  only  after 
he  has  first  restated  the  ideas  and  feelings  of  the  previous  speaker  accurately,  and 
to  that  speaker’s  satisfaction.’  ”  I  have  found  this  technique  very  useful,  in  my 
private  life  and  in  my  practice.  I  routinely  summarize  what  people  have  said  to 
me,  and  ask  them  if  I  have  understood  properly.  Sometimes  they  accept  my 
summary.  Sometimes  I  am  offered  a  small  correction.  Now  and  then  I  am  wrong 
completely.  All  of  that  is  good  to  know. 

There  are  several  primary  advantages  to  this  process  of  summary.  The  first 
advantage  is  that  I  genuinely  come  to  understand  what  the  person  is  saying.  Of 
this,  Rogers  notes,  “Sounds  simple,  doesn’t  it?  But  if  you  try  it  you  will  discover 
it  is  one  of  the  most  difficult  things  you  have  ever  tried  to  do.  If  you  really 
understand  a  person  in  this  way,  if  you  are  willing  to  enter  his  private  world  and 
see  the  way  life  appears  to  him,  you  run  the  risk  of  being  changed  yourself.  You 
might  see  it  his  way,  you  might  find  yourself  influenced  in  your  attitudes  or 
personality.  This  risk  of  being  changed  is  one  of  the  most  frightening  prospects 
most  of  us  can  face.”  More  salutary  words  have  rarely  been  written. 

The  second  advantage  to  the  act  of  summary  is  that  it  aids  the  person  in 
consolidation  and  utility  of  memory.  Consider  the  following  situation:  A  client  in 
my  practice  recounts  a  long,  meandering,  emotion-laden  account  of  a  difficult 
period  in  his  or  her  life.  We  summarize,  back  and  forth.  The  account  becomes 
shorter.  It  is  now  summed  up,  in  the  client’s  memory  (and  in  mine)  in  the  form 
we  discussed.  It  is  now  a  different  memory,  in  many  ways — with  luck,  a  better 
memory.  It  is  now  less  weighty.  It  has  been  distilled;  reduced  to  the  gist.  We 
have  extracted  the  moral  of  the  story.  It  becomes  a  description  of  the  cause  and 
the  result  of  what  happened,  formulated  such  that  repetition  of  the  tragedy  and 
pain  becomes  less  likely  in  the  future.  “This  is  what  happened.  This  is  why.  This 
is  what  I  have  to  do  to  avoid  such  things  from  now  on”:  That’s  a  successful 
memory.  That’s  the  purpose  of  memory.  You  remember  the  past  not  so  that  it  is 
“accurately  recorded,”  to  say  it  again,  but  so  that  you  are  prepared  for  the  future. 

The  third  advantage  to  employing  the  Rogerian  method  is  the  difficulty  it 


poses  to  the  careless  construction  of  straw-man  arguments.  When  someone 
opposes  you,  it  is  very  tempting  to  oversimplify,  parody,  or  distort  his  or  her 
position.  This  is  a  counterproductive  game,  designed  both  to  harm  the  dissenter 
and  to  unjustly  raise  your  personal  status.  By  contrast,  if  you  are  called  upon  to 
summarize  someone’s  position,  so  that  the  speaking  person  agrees  with  that 
summary,  you  may  have  to  state  the  argument  even  more  clearly  and  succinctly 
than  the  speaker  has  even  yet  managed.  If  you  first  give  the  devil  his  due, 
looking  at  his  arguments  from  his  perspective,  you  can  (1)  find  the  value  in 
them,  and  learn  something  in  the  process,  or  (2)  hone  your  positions  against 
them  (if  you  still  believe  they  are  wrong)  and  strengthen  your  arguments  further 
against  challenge.  This  will  make  you  much  stronger.  Then  you  will  no  longer 
have  to  misrepresent  your  opponent’s  position  (and  may  well  have  bridged  at 
least  part  of  the  gap  between  the  two  of  you).  You  will  also  be  much  better  at 
withstanding  your  own  doubts. 

Sometimes  it  takes  a  long  time  to  figure  out  what  someone  genuinely  means 
when  they  are  talking.  This  is  because  often  they  are  articulating  their  ideas  for 
the  first  time.  They  can’t  do  it  without  wandering  down  blind  alleys  or  making 
contradictory  or  even  nonsensical  claims.  This  is  partly  because  talking  (and 
thinking)  is  often  more  about  forgetting  than  about  remembering.  To  discuss  an 
event,  particularly  something  emotional,  like  a  death  or  serious  illness,  is  to 
slowly  choose  what  to  leave  behind.  To  begin,  however,  much  that  is  not 
necessary  must  be  put  into  words.  The  emotion-laden  speaker  must  recount  the 
whole  experience,  in  detail.  Only  then  can  the  central  narrative,  cause  and 
consequence,  come  into  focus  or  consolidate  itself.  Only  then  can  the  moral  of 
the  story  be  derived. 

Imagine  that  someone  holds  a  stack  of  hundred-dollar  bills,  some  of  which  are 
counterfeit.  All  the  bills  might  have  to  be  spread  on  a  table,  so  that  each  can  be 
seen,  and  any  differences  noted,  before  the  genuine  can  be  distinguished  from 
the  false.  This  is  the  sort  of  methodical  approach  you  have  to  take  when  really 
listening  to  someone  trying  to  solve  a  problem  or  communicate  something 
important.  If  upon  learning  that  some  of  the  bills  are  counterfeit  you  too  casually 
dismiss  all  of  them  (as  you  would  if  you  were  in  a  hurry,  or  otherwise  unwilling 
to  put  in  the  effort),  the  person  will  never  learn  to  separate  wheat  from  chaff. 

If  you  listen,  instead,  without  premature  judgment,  people  will  generally  tell 
you  everything  they  are  thinking — and  with  very  little  deceit.  People  will  tell 
you  the  most  amazing,  absurd,  interesting  things.  Very  few  of  your  conversations 
will  be  boring.  (You  can  in  fact  tell  whether  or  not  you  are  actually  listening  in 
this  manner.  If  the  conversation  is  boring,  you  probably  aren’t.) 


Primate  Dominance-Hierarchy  Manoeuvres — and  Wit 

Not  all  talking  is  thinking.  Nor  does  all  listening  foster  transformation.  There  are 
other  motives  for  both,  some  of  which  produce  much  less  valuable, 
counterproductive  and  even  dangerous  outcomes.  There  is  the  conversation,  for 
example,  where  one  participant  is  speaking  merely  to  establish  or  confirm  his 
place  in  the  dominance  hierarchy.  One  person  begins  by  telling  a  story  about 
some  interesting  occurrence,  recent  or  past,  that  involved  something  good,  bad 
or  surprising  enough  to  make  the  listening  worthwhile.  The  other  person,  now 
concerned  with  his  or  her  potentially  substandard  status  as  less-interesting 
individual,  immediately  thinks  of  something  better,  worse,  or  more  surprising  to 
relate.  This  isn’t  one  of  those  situations  where  two  conversational  participants 
are  genuinely  playing  off  each  other,  riffing  on  the  same  themes,  for  the  mutual 
enjoyment  of  both  (and  everyone  else).  This  is  jockeying  for  position,  pure  and 
simple.  You  can  tell  when  one  of  those  conversations  is  occurring.  They  are 
accompanied  by  a  feeling  of  embarrassment  among  speakers  and  alike,  all  who 
know  that  something  false  and  exaggerated  has  just  been  said. 

There  is  another,  closely  allied  form  of  conversation,  where  neither  speaker  is 
listening  in  the  least  to  the  other.  Instead,  each  is  using  the  time  occupied  by  the 
current  speaker  to  conjure  up  what  he  or  she  will  say  next,  which  will  often  be 
something  off-topic,  because  the  person  anxiously  waiting  to  speak  has  not  been 
listening.  This  can  and  will  bring  the  whole  conversational  train  to  a  shuddering 
halt.  At  this  point,  it  is  usual  for  those  who  were  on  board  during  the  crash  to 
remain  silent,  and  look  occasionally  and  in  a  somewhat  embarrassed  manner  at 
each  other,  until  everyone  leaves,  or  someone  thinks  of  something  witty  and  puts 
Humpty  Dumpty  together  again. 

Then  there  is  the  conversation  where  one  participant  is  trying  to  attain  victory 
for  his  point  of  view.  This  is  yet  another  variant  of  the  dominance-hierarchy 
conversation.  During  such  a  conversation,  which  often  tends  toward  the 
ideological,  the  speaker  endeavours  to  (1)  denigrate  or  ridicule  the  viewpoint  of 
anyone  holding  a  contrary  position,  (2)  use  selective  evidence  while  doing  so 
and,  finally,  (3)  impress  the  listeners  (many  of  whom  are  already  occupying  the 
same  ideological  space)  with  the  validity  of  his  assertions.  The  goal  is  to  gain 
support  for  a  comprehensive,  unitary,  oversimplified  world-view.  Thus,  the 
purpose  of  the  conversation  is  to  make  the  case  that  not  thinking  is  the  correct 
tack.  The  person  who  is  speaking  in  this  manner  believes  that  winning  the 
argument  makes  him  right,  and  that  doing  so  necessarily  validates  the 
assumption-structure  of  the  dominance  hierarchy  he  most  identifies  with.  This  is 
often — and  unsurprisingly — the  hierarchy  within  which  he  has  achieved  the 


most  success,  or  the  one  with  which  he  is  most  temperamentally  aligned.  Almost 
all  discussions  involving  politics  or  economics  unfold  in  this  manner,  with  each 
participant  attempting  to  justify  fixed,  a  priori  positions  instead  of  trying  to  learn 
something  or  to  adopt  a  different  frame  (even  for  the  novelty).  It  is  for  this 
reason  that  conservatives  and  liberals  alike  believe  their  positions  to  be  self- 
evident,  particularly  as  they  become  more  extreme.  Given  certain 
temperamentally-based  assumptions,  a  predictable  conclusion  emerges — but 
only  when  you  ignore  the  fact  that  the  assumptions  themselves  are  mutable. 

These  conversations  are  very  different  from  the  listening  type.  When  a 
genuine  listening  conversation  is  taking  place,  one  person  at  a  time  has  the  floor, 
and  everyone  else  is  listening.  The  person  speaking  is  granted  the  opportunity  to 
seriously  discuss  some  event,  usually  unhappy  or  even  tragic.  Everyone  else 
responds  sympathetically.  These  conversations  are  important  because  the  speaker 
is  organizing  the  troublesome  event  in  his  or  her  mind,  while  recounting  the 
story.  The  fact  is  important  enough  to  bear  repeating:  people  organize  their 
brains  with  conversation.  If  they  don’t  have  anyone  to  tell  their  story  to,  they 
lose  their  minds.  Like  hoarders,  they  cannot  unclutter  themselves.  The  input  of 
the  community  is  required  for  the  integrity  of  the  individual  psyche.  To  put  it 
another  way:  It  takes  a  village  to  organize  a  mind. 

Much  of  what  we  consider  healthy  mental  function  is  the  result  of  our  ability 
to  use  the  reactions  of  others  to  keep  our  complex  selves  functional.  We 
outsource  the  problem  of  our  sanity.  This  is  why  it  is  the  fundamental 
responsibility  of  parents  to  render  their  children  socially  acceptable.  If  a  person’s 
behaviour  is  such  that  other  people  can  tolerate  him,  then  all  he  has  to  do  is  place 
himself  in  a  social  context.  Then  people  will  indicate — by  being  interested  in  or 
bored  by  what  he  says,  or  laughing  or  not  laughing  at  his  jokes,  or  teasing  or 
ridiculing,  or  even  by  lifting  an  eyebrow — whether  his  actions  and  statements 
are  what  they  should  be.  Everyone  is  always  broadcasting  to  everyone  else  their 
desire  to  encounter  the  ideal.  We  punish  and  reward  each  other  precisely  to  the 
degree  that  each  of  us  behaves  in  keeping  with  that  desire — except,  of  course, 
when  we  are  looking  for  trouble. 

The  sympathetic  responses  offered  during  a  genuine  conversation  indicate  that 
the  teller  is  valued,  and  that  the  story  being  told  is  important,  serious,  deserving 
of  consideration,  and  understandable.  Men  and  women  often  misunderstand  each 
other  when  these  conversations  are  focused  on  a  specified  problem.  Men  are 
often  accused  of  wanting  to  “fix  things”  too  early  on  in  a  discussion.  This 
frustrates  men,  who  like  to  solve  problems  and  to  do  it  efficiently  and  who  are  in 
fact  called  upon  frequently  by  women  for  precisely  that  purpose.  It  might  be 
easier  for  my  male  readers  to  understand  why  this  does  not  work,  however,  if 


they  could  realize  and  then  remember  that  before  a  problem  can  be  solved  it 
must  be  formulated  precisely.  Women  are  often  intent  on  formulating  the 
problem  when  they  are  discussing  something,  and  they  need  to  be  listened  to — 
even  questioned — to  help  ensure  clarity  in  the  formulation.  Then,  whatever 
problem  is  left,  if  any,  can  be  helpfully  solved.  (It  should  also  be  noted  first  that 
too-early  problem-solving  may  also  merely  indicate  a  desire  to  escape  from  the 
effort  of  the  problem-formulating  conversation.) 

Another  conversational  variant  is  the  lecture.  A  lecture  is — somewhat 
surprisingly — a  conversation.  The  lecturer  speaks,  but  the  audience 
communicates  with  him  or  her  non-verbally.  A  surprising  amount  of  human 
interaction — much  of  the  delivery  of  emotional  information,  for  example — takes 
place  in  this  manner,  through  postural  display  and  facial  emotion  (as  we  noted  in 
our  discussion  of  Freud).  A  good  lecturer  is  not  only  delivering  facts  (which  is 
perhaps  the  least  important  part  of  a  lecture),  but  also  telling  stories  about  those 
facts,  pitching  them  precisely  to  the  level  of  the  audience’s  comprehension, 
gauging  that  by  the  interest  they  are  showing.  The  story  he  or  she  is  telling 
conveys  to  the  members  of  the  audience  not  only  what  the  facts  are,  but  why  they 
are  relevant — why  it  is  important  to  know  certain  things  about  which  they  are 
currently  ignorant.  To  demonstrate  the  importance  of  some  set  of  facts  is  to  tell 
those  audience  members  how  such  knowledge  could  change  their  behaviour,  or 
influence  the  way  they  interpret  the  world,  so  that  they  will  now  be  able  to  avoid 
some  obstacles  and  progress  more  rapidly  to  some  better  goals. 

A  good  lecturer  is  thus  talking  with  and  not  at  or  even  to  his  or  her  listeners. 

To  manage  this,  the  lecturer  needs  to  be  closely  attending  to  the  audience’s  every 
move,  gesture  and  sound.  Perversely,  this  cannot  be  done  by  watching  the 
audience,  as  such.  A  good  lecturer  speaks  directly  to  and  watches  the  response 
of  single,  identifiable  people, fn2  instead  of  doing  something  cliched,  such  as 
“presenting  a  talk”  to  an  audience.  Everything  about  that  phrase  is  wrong.  You 
don’t  present.  You  talk.  There  is  no  such  thing  as  “a  talk,”  unless  it’s  canned,  and 
it  shouldn’t  be.  There  is  also  no  “audience.”  There  are  individuals,  who  need  to 
be  included  in  the  conversation.  A  well-practised  and  competent  public  speaker 
addresses  a  single,  identifiable  person,  watches  that  individual  nod,  shake  his 
head,  frown,  or  look  confused,  and  responds  appropriately  and  directly  to  those 
gestures  and  expressions.  Then,  after  a  few  phrases,  rounding  out  some  idea,  he 
switches  to  another  audience  member,  and  does  the  same  thing.  In  this  manner, 
he  infers  and  reacts  to  the  attitude  of  the  entire  group  (insofar  as  such  a  thing 
exists). 

There  are  still  other  conversations  that  work  primarily  as  demonstrations  of 
wit.  These  also  have  a  dominance  element,  but  the  goal  is  to  be  the  most 


entertaining  speaker  (which  is  an  accomplishment  that  everyone  participating 
will  also  enjoy).  The  purpose  of  these  conversations,  as  a  witty  friend  of  mine 
once  observed,  was  to  say  “anything  that  was  either  true  or  funny.”  As  truth  and 
humour  are  often  close  allies,  that  combination  worked  fine.  I  think  that  this 
might  be  the  intelligent  blue-collar  worker’s  conversation.  I  participated  in  many 
fine  bouts  of  sarcasm,  satire,  insult  and  generally  over-the-top  comedic  exchange 
around  among  people  I  grew  up  with  in  Northern  Alberta  and,  later,  among  some 
Navy  SEALs  I  met  in  California,  who  were  friends  of  an  author  I  know  who 
writes  somewhat  horrifying  popular  fiction.  They  were  all  perfectly  happy  to  say 
anything,  no  matter  how  appalling,  as  long  it  was  funny. 

I  attended  this  writer’s  fortieth  birthday  celebration  not  too  long  ago  in  LA. 

He  had  invited  one  of  the  aforementioned  SEALs.  A  few  months  beforehand, 
however,  his  wife  had  been  diagnosed  with  a  serious  medical  condition, 
necessitating  brain  surgery.  He  called  up  his  SEAL  friend,  informed  him  of  the 
circumstances,  and  indicated  that  the  event  might  have  to  be  cancelled.  “You 
think  you  guys  have  a  problem,”  responded  his  friend.  “I  just  bought  non- 
refundable  airline  tickets  to  your  party!”  It’s  not  clear  what  percentage  of  the 
world’s  population  would  find  that  response  amusing.  I  retold  the  story  recently 
to  a  group  of  newer  acquaintances  and  they  were  more  shocked  and  appalled 
than  amused.  I  tried  to  defend  the  joke  as  an  indication  of  the  SEAL’S  respect  for 
the  couple’s  ability  to  withstand  and  transcend  tragedy,  but  I  wasn’t  particularly 
successful.  Nonetheless,  I  believe  that  he  did  intend  exactly  that  respect,  and  I 
think  he  was  terrifyingly  witty.  His  joke  was  daring,  anarchic  to  the  point  of 
recklessness,  which  is  exactly  the  point  where  serious  funny  occurs.  My  friend 
and  his  wife  recognized  the  compliment.  They  saw  that  their  friend  knew  they 
were  tough  enough  to  withstand  that  level  of — well,  let’s  call  it  competitive 
humour.  It  was  a  test  of  character,  which  they  passed  with  flying  colours. 

I  found  that  such  conversations  occurred  less  and  less  frequently  as  I  moved 
from  university  to  university,  up  the  educational  and  social  ladder.  Maybe  it 
wasn’t  a  class  thing,  although  I  have  my  suspicions  it  was.  Maybe  it’s  just  that 
I’m  older,  or  that  the  friends  a  person  makes  later  in  life,  after  adolescence,  lack 
the  insane  competitive  closeness  and  perverse  playfulness  of  those  early  tribal 
bonds.  When  I  went  back  up  north  to  my  hometown  for  my  fiftieth  birthday 
party,  however,  my  old  friends  made  me  laugh  so  hard  I  had  to  duck  into  a 
different  room  several  times  to  catch  my  breath.  Those  conversations  are  the 
most  fun,  and  I  miss  them.  You  have  to  keep  up,  or  risk  severe  humiliation,  but 
there  is  nothing  more  rewarding  than  topping  the  last  comedian’s  story,  joke, 
insult  or  curse.  Only  one  rule  really  applies:  do  not  be  boring  (although  it  is  also 


very  bad  form  to  actually  put  someone  down,  when  you  are  only  pretending  to 
put  them  down). 

Conversation  on  the  Way 

The  final  type  of  conversation,  akin  to  listening,  is  a  form  of  mutual  exploration. 
It  requires  true  reciprocity  on  the  part  of  those  listening  and  speaking.  It  allows 
all  participants  to  express  and  organize  their  thoughts.  A  conversation  of  mutual 
exploration  has  a  topic,  generally  complex,  of  genuine  interest  to  the 
participants.  Everyone  participating  is  trying  to  solve  a  problem,  instead  of 
insisting  on  the  a  priori  validity  of  their  own  positions.  All  are  acting  on  the 
premise  that  they  have  something  to  learn.  This  kind  of  conversation  constitutes 
active  philosophy,  the  highest  form  of  thought,  and  the  best  preparation  for 
proper  living. 

The  people  involved  in  such  a  conversation  must  be  discussing  ideas  they 
genuinely  use  to  structure  their  perceptions  and  guide  their  actions  and  words. 
They  must  be  existentially  involved  with  their  philosophy:  that  is,  they  must  be 
living  it,  not  merely  believing  or  understanding  it.  They  also  must  have  inverted, 
at  least  temporarily,  the  typical  human  preference  for  order  over  chaos  (and  I 
don’t  mean  the  chaos  typical  of  mindless  antisocial  rebellion).  Other 
conversational  types — except  for  the  listening  type — all  attempt  to  buttress  some 
existing  order.  The  conversation  of  mutual  exploration,  by  contrast,  requires 
people  who  have  decided  that  the  unknown  makes  a  better  friend  than  the 
known. 

You  already  know  what  you  know,  after  all — and,  unless  your  life  is  perfect, 
what  you  know  is  not  enough.  You  remain  threatened  by  disease,  and  self- 
deception,  and  unhappiness,  and  malevolence,  and  betrayal,  and  corruption,  and 
pain,  and  limitation.  You  are  subject  to  all  these  things,  in  the  final  analysis, 
because  you  are  just  too  ignorant  to  protect  yourself.  If  you  just  knew  enough, 
you  could  be  healthier  and  more  honest.  You  would  suffer  less.  You  could 
recognize,  resist  and  even  triumph  over  malevolence  and  evil.  You  would  neither 
betray  a  friend,  nor  deal  falsely  and  deceitfully  in  business,  politics  or  love. 
However,  your  current  knowledge  has  neither  made  you  perfect  nor  kept  you 
safe.  So,  it  is  insufficient,  by  definition — radically,  fatally  insufficient. 

You  must  accept  this  before  you  can  converse  philosophically,  instead  of 
convincing,  oppressing,  dominating  or  even  amusing.  You  must  accept  this 
before  you  can  tolerate  a  conversation  where  the  Word  that  eternally  mediates 
between  order  and  chaos  is  operating,  psychologically  speaking.  To  have  this 
kind  of  conversation,  it  is  necessary  to  respect  the  personal  experience  of  your 


conversational  partners.  You  must  assume  that  they  have  reached  careful, 
thoughtful,  genuine  conclusions  (and,  perhaps,  they  must  have  done  the  work 
that  justifies  this  assumption).  You  must  believe  that  if  they  shared  their 
conclusions  with  you,  you  could  bypass  at  least  some  of  the  pain  of  personally 
learning  the  same  things  (as  learning  from  the  experience  of  others  can  be 
quicker  and  much  less  dangerous).  You  must  meditate,  too,  instead  of 
strategizing  towards  victory.  If  you  fail,  or  refuse,  to  do  so,  then  you  merely  and 
automatically  repeat  what  you  already  believe,  seeking  its  validation  and 
insisting  on  its  rightness.  But  if  you  are  meditating  as  you  converse,  then  you 
listen  to  the  other  person,  and  say  the  new  and  original  things  that  can  rise  from 
deep  within  of  their  own  accord. 

It’s  as  if  you  are  listening  to  yourself  during  such  a  conversation,  just  as  you 
are  listening  to  the  other  person.  You  are  describing  how  you  are  responding  to 
the  new  information  imparted  by  the  speaker.  You  are  reporting  what  that 
information  has  done  to  you — what  new  things  it  made  appear  within  you,  how 
it  has  changed  your  presuppositions,  how  it  has  made  you  think  of  new 
questions.  You  tell  the  speaker  these  things,  directly.  Then  they  have  the  same 
effect  on  him.  In  this  manner,  you  both  move  towards  somewhere  newer  and 
broader  and  better.  You  both  change,  as  you  let  your  old  presuppositions  die — as 
you  shed  your  skins  and  emerge  renewed. 

A  conversation  such  as  this  is  one  where  it  is  the  desire  for  truth  itself — on  the 
part  of  both  participants — that  is  truly  listening  and  speaking.  That’s  why  it’s 
engaging,  vital,  interesting  and  meaningful.  That  sense  of  meaning  is  a  signal 
from  the  deep,  ancient  parts  of  your  Being.  You’re  where  you  should  be,  with 
one  foot  in  order,  and  the  other  tentatively  extended  into  chaos  and  the  unknown. 
You’re  immersed  in  the  Tao,  following  the  great  Way  of  Life.  There,  you’re 
stable  enough  to  be  secure,  but  flexible  enough  to  transform.  There,  you’re 
allowing  new  information  to  inform  you — to  permeate  your  stability,  to  repair 
and  improve  its  structure,  and  expand  its  domain.  There  the  constituent  elements 
of  your  Being  can  find  their  more  elegant  formation.  A  conversation  like  that 
places  you  in  the  same  place  that  listening  to  great  music  places  you,  and  for 
much  the  same  reason.  A  conversation  like  that  puts  you  in  the  realm  where 
souls  connect,  and  that’s  a  real  place.  It  leaves  you  thinking,  “That  was  really 
worthwhile.  We  really  got  to  know  each  other.”  The  masks  came  off,  and  the 
searchers  were  revealed. 

So,  listen,  to  yourself  and  to  those  with  whom  you  are  speaking.  Your  wisdom 
then  consists  not  of  the  knowledge  you  already  have,  but  the  continual  search  for 
knowledge,  which  is  the  highest  form  of  wisdom.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  the 
priestess  of  the  Delphic  Oracle  in  ancient  Greece  spoke  most  highly  of  Socrates, 


who  always  sought  the  truth.  She  described  him  as  the  wisest  living  man, 
because  he  knew  that  what  he  knew  was  nothing. 

Assume  that  the  person  you  are  listening  to  might  know  something  you  don’t. 


RULE  10 


BE  PRECISE  IN  YOUR  SPEECH 

WHY  IS  MY  LAPTOP  OBSOLETE? 

What  do  you  see,  when  you  look  at  a  computer — at  your  own  laptop,  more 
precisely?  You  see  a  flat,  thin,  grey-and-black  box.  Less  evidently,  you  see 
something  to  type  on  and  look  at.  Nonetheless,  even  with  the  second  perceptions 
included,  what  are  you  seeing  is  hardly  the  computer  at  all.  That  grey  and  black 
box  happens  to  be  a  computer  right  now,  right  here  and  now,  and  maybe  even  an 
expensive  computer.  Nevertheless,  it  will  soon  be  something  so  unlike  a 
computer  that  it  will  be  difficult  even  to  give  away. 

We  will  all  discard  our  laptops  within  the  next  five  years,  even  though  they 
may  still  work  perfectly — even  though  the  screens,  keyboards,  mice  and  internet 
connections  may  still  flawlessly  perform  their  tasks.  Fifty  years  from  now,  early 
twenty-first-century  laptops  will  be  oddities  like  the  brass  scientific  tools  of  the 
late  nineteenth  century.  The  latter  now  appear  more  like  the  arcane 
accoutrements  of  alchemy,  designed  to  measure  phenomena  whose  existence  we 
no  longer  even  recognize.  How  can  high-tech  machines,  each  possessing  more 
computing  power  than  the  entire  Apollo  space  program,  lose  their  value  in  such 
a  short  period  of  time?  How  can  they  transform  so  quickly  from  exciting,  useful 
and  status-enhancing  machines  to  complex  pieces  of  junk?  It’s  because  of  the 
nature  of  our  perceptions  themselves,  and  the  oft-invisible  interaction  between 
those  perceptions  and  the  underlying  complexity  of  the  world. 

Your  laptop  is  a  note  in  a  symphony  currently  being  played  by  an  orchestra  of 
incalculable  size.  It’s  a  very  small  part  of  a  much  greater  whole.  Most  of  its 
capacity  resides  beyond  its  hard  shell.  It  maintains  its  function  only  because  a 
vast  array  of  other  technologies  are  currently  and  harmoniously  at  play.  It  is  fed, 
for  example,  by  a  power  grid  whose  function  is  invisibly  dependent  on  the 
stability  of  a  myriad  of  complex  physical,  biological,  economic  and  interpersonal 
systems.  The  factories  that  make  its  parts  are  still  in  operation.  The  operating 
system  that  enables  its  function  is  based  on  those  parts,  and  not  on  others  yet  to 
be  created.  Its  video  hardware  runs  the  technology  expected  by  the  creative 
people  who  post  their  content  on  the  web.  Your  laptop  is  in  communication  with 
a  certain,  specified  ecosystem  of  other  devices  and  web  servers. 

And,  finally,  all  this  is  made  possible  by  an  even  less  visible  element:  the 
social  contract  of  trust — the  interconnected  and  fundamentally  honest  political 


and  economic  systems  that  make  the  reliable  electrical  grid  a  reality.  This 
interdependency  of  part  on  whole,  invisible  in  systems  that  work,  becomes 
starkly  evident  in  systems  that  don’t.  The  higher-order,  surrounding  systems  that 
enable  personal  computing  hardly  exist  at  all  in  corrupt,  third-world  countries,  so 
that  the  power  lines,  electrical  switches,  outlets,  and  all  the  other  entities  so 
hopefully  and  concretely  indicative  of  such  a  grid  are  absent  or  compromised, 
and  in  fact  make  little  contribution  to  the  practical  delivery  of  electricity  to 
people’s  homes  and  factories.  This  makes  perceiving  the  electronic  and  other 
devices  that  electricity  theoretically  enables  as  separate,  functional  units 
frustrating,  at  minimum,  and  impossible,  at  worst.  This  is  partly  because  of 
technical  insufficiency:  the  systems  simply  don’t  work.  But  it  is  also  in  no  small 
part  because  of  the  lack  of  trust  characteristic  of  systemically  corrupt  societies. 

To  put  it  another  way:  What  you  perceive  as  your  computer  is  like  a  single 
leaf,  on  a  tree,  in  a  forest — or,  even  more  accurately,  like  your  fingers  rubbing 
briefly  across  that  leaf.  A  single  leaf  can  be  plucked  from  a  branch.  It  can  be 
perceived,  briefly,  as  a  single,  self-contained  entity — but  that  perception 
misleads  more  than  clarifies.  In  a  few  weeks,  the  leaf  will  crumble  and  dissolve. 
It  would  not  have  been  there  at  all,  without  the  tree.  It  cannot  continue  to  exist, 
in  the  absence  of  the  tree.  This  is  the  position  of  our  laptops  in  relation  to  the 
world.  So  much  of  what  they  are  resides  outside  their  boundaries  that  the 
screened  devices  we  hold  on  our  laps  can  only  maintain  their  computer-like 
facade  for  a  few  short  years. 

Almost  everything  we  see  and  hold  is  like  that,  although  often  not  so 
evidently. 

Tools,  Obstacles  and  Extension  into  the  World 

We  assume  that  we  see  objects  or  things  when  we  look  at  the  world,  but  that’s 
not  really  how  it  is.  Our  evolved  perceptual  systems  transform  the 
interconnected,  complex  multi-level  world  that  we  inhabit  not  so  much  into 
things  per  se  as  into  useful  things  (or  their  nemeses,  things  that  get  in  the  way). 
This  is  the  necessary,  practical  reduction  of  the  world.  This  is  the  transformation 
of  the  near-infinite  complexity  of  things  through  the  narrow  specification  of  our 
purpose.  This  is  how  precision  makes  the  world  sensibly  manifest.  That  is  not  at 
all  the  same  as  perceiving  objects. 

We  don’t  see  valueless  entities  and  then  attribute  meaning  to  them.  We 
perceive  the  meaning  directly.  We  see  floors,  to  walk  on,  and  doors,  to  duck 
through,  and  chairs,  to  sit  on.  It’s  for  this  reason  that  a  beanbag  and  a  stump  both 
fall  into  the  latter  category,  despite  having  little  objectively  in  common.  We  see 


rocks,  because  we  can  throw  them,  and  clouds,  because  they  can  rain  on  us,  and 
apples,  to  eat,  and  the  automobiles  of  other  people,  to  get  in  our  way  and  annoy 
us.  We  see  tools  and  obstacles,  not  objects  or  things.  Furthermore,  we  see  tools 
and  obstacles  at  the  “handy”  level  of  analysis  that  makes  them  most  useful  (or 
dangerous),  given  our  needs,  abilities  and  perceptual  limitations.  The  world 
reveals  itself  to  us  as  something  to  utilize  and  something  to  navigate  through — 
not  as  something  that  merely  is. 

We  see  the  faces  of  the  people  we  are  talking  to,  because  we  need  to 
communicate  with  those  people  and  cooperate  with  them.  We  don’t  see  their 
microcosmic  substructures,  their  cells,  or  the  subcellular  organelles,  molecules 
and  atoms  that  make  up  those  cells.  We  don’t  see,  as  well,  the  macrocosm  that 
surrounds  them:  the  family  members  and  friends  that  make  up  their  immediate 
social  circles,  the  economies  they  are  embedded  within,  or  the  ecology  that 
contains  all  of  them.  Finally,  and  equally  importantly,  we  don’t  see  them  across 
time.  We  see  them  in  the  narrow,  immediate,  overwhelming  now,  instead  of 
surrounded  by  the  yesterdays  and  tomorrows  that  may  be  a  more  important  part 
of  them  than  whatever  is  currently  and  obviously  manifest.  And  we  have  to  see 
in  this  way,  or  be  overwhelmed. 

When  we  look  at  the  world,  we  perceive  only  what  is  enough  for  our  plans 
and  actions  to  work  and  for  us  to  get  by.  What  we  inhabit,  then,  is  this  “enough.” 
That  is  a  radical,  functional,  unconscious  simplification  of  the  world — and  it’s 
almost  impossible  for  us  not  to  mistake  it  for  the  world  itself.  But  the  objects  we 
see  are  not  simply  there,  in  the  world,  for  our  simple,  direct  perceiving. fnl  They 
exist  in  a  complex,  multi-dimensional  relationship  to  one  another,  not  as  self- 
evidently  separate,  bounded,  independent  objects.  We  perceive  not  them,  but 
their  functional  utility  and,  in  doing  so,  we  make  them  sufficiently  simple  for 
sufficient  understanding.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  we  must  be  precise  in  our  aim. 
Absent  that,  we  drown  in  the  complexity  of  the  world. 

This  is  true  even  for  our  perceptions  of  ourselves,  of  our  individual  persons. 
We  assume  that  we  end  at  the  surface  of  our  skin,  because  of  the  way  that  we 
perceive.  But  we  can  understand  with  a  little  thought  the  provisional  nature  of 
that  boundary.  We  shift  what  is  inside  our  skin,  so  to  speak,  as  the  context  we 
inhabit  changes.  Even  when  we  do  something  as  apparently  simple  as  picking  up 
a  screwdriver,  our  brain  automatically  adjusts  what  it  considers  body  to  include 
the  tool.  We  can  literally  feel  things  with  the  end  of  the  screwdriver.  When  we 
extend  a  hand,  holding  the  screwdriver,  we  automatically  take  the  length  of  the 
latter  into  account.  We  can  probe  nooks  and  crannies  with  its  extended  end,  and 
comprehend  what  we  are  exploring.  Furthermore,  we  instantly  regard  the 
screwdriver  we  are  holding  as  “our”  screwdriver,  and  get  possessive  about  it.  We 


do  the  same  with  the  much  more  complex  tools  we  use,  in  much  more  complex 
situations.  The  cars  we  pilot  instantaneously  and  automatically  become 
ourselves.  Because  of  this,  when  someone  bangs  his  fist  on  our  car’s  hood  after 
we  have  irritated  him  at  a  crosswalk,  we  take  it  personally.  This  is  not  always 
reasonable.  Nonetheless,  without  the  extension  of  self  into  machine,  it  would  be 
impossible  to  drive. 

The  extensible  boundaries  of  our  selves  also  expand  to  include  other  people — 
family  members,  lovers  and  friends.  A  mother  will  sacrifice  herself  for  her 
children.  Is  our  father  or  son  or  wife  or  husband  more  or  less  integral  to  us  than 
an  arm  or  a  leg?  We  can  answer,  in  part,  by  asking:  Which  we  rather  lose? 

Which  loss  would  we  sacrifice  more  to  avoid?  We  practice  for  such  permanent 
extension — such  permanent  commitment — by  identifying  with  the  fictional 
characters  of  books  and  movies.  Their  tragedies  and  triumphs  rapidly  and 
convincingly  become  ours.  Sitting  still  in  our  seats,  we  nonetheless  act  out  a 
multitude  of  alternate  realities,  extending  ourselves  experimentally,  testing 
multiple  potential  paths,  before  specifying  the  one  we  will  actually  take. 
Engrossed  in  a  fictional  world,  we  can  even  become  things  that  don’t  “really” 
exist.  In  the  blink  of  an  eye,  in  the  magic  hall  of  a  movie  theatre,  we  can  become 
fantastical  creatures.  We  sit  in  the  dark  before  rapidly  flickering  images  and 
become  witches,  superheroes,  aliens,  vampires,  lions,  elves  or  wooden 
marionettes.  We  feel  everything  they  feel,  and  are  peculiarly  happy  to  pay  for  the 
privilege,  even  when  what  we  experience  is  sorrow,  fear  or  horror. 

Something  similar,  but  more  extreme,  happens  when  we  identify,  not  with  a 
character  in  a  fictional  drama,  but  with  a  whole  group,  in  a  competition.  Think  of 
what  happens  when  a  favourite  team  wins  or  loses  an  important  game  against  an 
arch-rival.  The  winning  goal  will  bring  the  whole  network  of  fans  to  their  feet, 
before  they  think,  in  unscripted  unison.  It  is  as  if  their  many  nervous  systems  are 
directly  wired  to  the  game  unfolding  in  front  of  them.  Fans  take  the  victories  and 
defeats  of  their  teams  very  personally,  even  wearing  the  jerseys  of  their  heroes, 
often  celebrating  their  wins  and  losses  more  than  any  such  events  that  “actually” 
occur  in  their  day-to-day  lives.  This  identification  manifests  itself  deeply — even 
biochemically  and  neurologically.  Vicarious  experiences  of  winning  and  losing, 
for  example,  raise  and  lower  testosterone  levels  among  fans  “participating”  in 
the  contest.  Our  capacity  for  identification  is  something  that  manifests  itself  at 
every  level  of  our  Being. 

To  the  degree  that  we  are  patriotic,  similarly,  our  country  is  not  just  important 
to  us.  It  is  us.  We  might  even  sacrifice  our  entire  smaller  individual  selves,  in 
battle,  to  maintain  the  integrity  of  our  country.  For  much  of  history,  such 
willingness  to  die  has  been  regarded  as  something  admirable  and  courageous,  as 


a  part  of  human  duty.  Paradoxically,  that  is  a  direct  consequence  not  of  our 
aggression  but  of  our  extreme  sociability  and  willingness  to  cooperate.  If  we  can 
become  not  only  ourselves,  but  our  families,  teams  and  countries,  cooperation 
comes  easily  to  us,  relying  on  the  same  deeply  innate  mechanisms  that  drive  us 
(and  other  creatures)  to  protect  our  very  bodies. 

The  World  Is  Simple  Only  When  It  Behaves 

It  is  very  difficult  to  make  sense  of  the  interconnected  chaos  of  reality,  just  by 
looking  at  it.  It’s  a  very  complicated  act,  requiring,  perhaps,  half  our  brains. 
Everything  shifts  and  changes  in  the  real  world.  Each  hypothetically  separate 
thing  is  made  up  of  smaller  hypothetically  separate  things,  and  is  simultaneously 
part  of  larger  hypothetically  separate  things.  The  boundaries  between  the  levels 
— and  between  different  things  themselves  at  a  given  level — are  neither  clear  nor 
self-evident,  objectively.  They  must  be  established  practically,  pragmatically, 
and  they  retain  their  validity  only  under  very  narrow  and  specified  conditions. 
The  conscious  illusion  of  complete  and  sufficient  perception  only  sustains  itself, 
for  example — only  remains  sufficient  for  our  purposes — when  everything  goes 
according  to  plan.  Under  such  circumstances,  what  we  see  is  accurate  enough,  so 
that  there  is  no  utility  in  looking  farther.  To  drive  successfully,  we  don’t  have  to 
understand,  or  even  perceive,  the  complex  machinery  of  our  automobiles.  The 
hidden  complexities  of  our  private  cars  only  intrude  on  our  consciousness  when 
that  machinery  fails,  or  when  we  collide  unexpectedly  with  something  (or 
something  with  us).  Even  in  the  case  of  mere  mechanical  failure  (to  say  nothing 
of  a  serious  accident)  such  intrusion  is  always  felt,  at  least  initially,  as  anxiety- 
provoking.  That’s  a  consequence  of  emergent  uncertainty. 

A  car,  as  we  perceive  it,  is  not  a  thing,  or  an  object.  It  is  instead  something  that 
takes  us  somewhere  we  want  to  go.  It  is  only  when  it  stops  taking  us  and  going, 
in  fact,  that  we  perceive  it  much  at  all.  It  is  only  when  a  car  quits,  suddenly — or 
is  involved  in  an  accident  and  must  be  pulled  over  to  the  side  of  the  road — that 
we  are  forced  to  apprehend  and  analyze  the  myriad  of  parts  that  “car  as  thing 
that  goes”  depends  on.  When  our  car  fails,  our  incompetence  with  regards  to  its 
complexity  is  instantly  revealed.  That  has  practical  consequences  (we  don’t  get 
to  go  to  where  we  were  going),  as  well  as  psychological:  our  peace  of  mind 
disappears  along  with  our  functioning  vehicle.  We  must  generally  turn  to  the 
experts  who  inhabit  garages  and  workshops  to  restore  both  functionality  to  our 
vehicle  and  simplicity  to  our  perceptions.  That’s  mechanic-as-psychologist. 

It  is  precisely  then  that  we  can  understand,  although  we  seldom  deeply 
consider,  the  staggeringly  low-resolution  quality  of  our  vision  and  the 


inadequacy  of  our  corresponding  understanding.  In  a  crisis,  when  our  thing  no 
longer  goes,  we  turn  to  those  whose  expertise  far  transcends  ours  to  restore  the 
match  between  our  expectant  desire  and  what  actually  happens.  This  all  means 
that  the  failure  of  our  car  can  also  force  us  to  confront  the  uncertainty  of  the 
broader  social  context,  which  is  usually  invisible  to  us,  in  which  the  machine 
(and  mechanic)  are  mere  parts.  Betrayed  by  our  car,  we  come  up  against  all  the 
things  we  don’t  know.  Is  it  time  for  a  new  vehicle?  Did  I  err  in  my  original 
purchase?  Is  the  mechanic  competent,  honest  and  reliable?  Is  the  garage  he 
works  for  trustworthy?  Sometimes,  too,  we  must  contemplate  something  worse, 
something  broader  and  deeper:  Have  the  roads  now  become  too  dangerous? 

Have  I  become  (or  always  been)  too  incompetent?  Too  scattered  and  inattentive? 
Too  old?  The  limitations  of  all  our  perceptions  of  things  and  selves  manifest 
themselves  when  something  we  can  usually  depend  on  in  our  simplified  world 
breaks  down.  Then  the  more  complex  world  that  was  always  there,  invisible  and 
conveniently  ignored,  makes  its  presence  known.  It  is  then  that  the  walled 
garden  we  archetypally  inhabit  reveals  its  hidden  but  ever-present  snakes. 

You  and  I  Are  Simple  Only  When  the  World  Behaves 

When  things  break  down,  what  has  been  ignored  rushes  in.  When  things  are  no 
longer  specified,  with  precision,  the  walls  crumble,  and  chaos  makes  its  presence 
known.  When  we’ve  been  careless,  and  let  things  slide,  what  we  have  refused  to 
attend  to  gathers  itself  up,  adopts  a  serpentine  form,  and  strikes — often  at  the 
worst  possible  moment.  It  is  then  that  we  see  what  focused  intent,  precision  of 
aim  and  careful  attention  protects  us  from. 

Imagine  a  loyal  and  honest  wife  suddenly  confronted  by  evidence  of  her 
husband’s  infidelity.  She  has  lived  alongside  him  for  years.  She  saw  him  as  she 
assumes  he  is:  reliable,  hard-working,  loving,  dependable.  In  her  marriage,  she  is 
standing  on  a  rock,  or  so  she  believes.  But  he  becomes  less  attentive  and  more 
distracted.  He  begins,  in  the  cliched  manner,  to  work  longer  hours.  Small  things 
she  says  and  does  irritate  him  unjustifiably.  One  day  she  sees  him  in  a  downtown 
cafe  with  another  woman,  interacting  with  her  in  a  manner  difficult  to  rationalize 
and  ignore.  The  limitations  and  inaccuracy  of  her  former  perceptions  become 
immediately  and  painfully  obvious. 

Her  theory  of  her  husband  collapses.  What  happens,  in  consequence?  First, 
something — someone — emerges  in  his  stead:  a  complex,  frightening  stranger. 
That’s  bad  enough.  But  it’s  only  half  the  problem.  Her  theory  of  herself 
collapses,  too,  in  the  aftermath  of  the  betrayal,  so  that  it’s  not  one  stranger  that’s 
the  problem:  it’s  two.  Her  husband  is  not  who  she  perceived  him  to  be — but 


neither  is  she,  the  betrayed  wife.  She  is  no  longer  the  “well-loved,  secure  wife, 
and  valued  partner.”  Strangely  enough,  despite  our  belief  in  the  permanent 
immutability  of  the  past,  she  may  never  have  been. 

The  past  is  not  necessarily  what  it  was,  even  though  it  has  already  been.  The 
present  is  chaotic  and  indeterminate.  The  ground  shifts  continually  around  her 
feet,  and  ours.  Equally,  the  future,  not  yet  here,  changes  into  something  it  was 
not  supposed  to  be.  Is  the  once  reasonably  content  wife  now  a  “deceived 
innocent” — or  a  “gullible  fool”?  Should  she  view  herself  as  victim,  or  as  co¬ 
conspirator  in  a  shared  delusion?  Her  husband  is — what?  An  unsatisfied  lover? 

A  target  of  seduction?  A  psychopathic  liar?  The  very  Devil  himself?  How  could 
he  be  so  cruel  ?  How  could  anyone?  What  is  this  home  she  has  been  living  in? 
How  could  she  be  so  naive?  How  could  anyone?  She  looks  in  the  mirror.  Who  is 
she?  What’s  going  on?  Are  any  of  her  relationships  real?  Have  any  of  them  ever 
been?  What  has  happened  to  the  future?  Everything  is  up  for  grabs,  when  the 
deeper  realities  of  the  world  unexpectedly  manifest  themselves. 

Everything  is  intricate  beyond  imagining.  Everything  is  affected  by  everything 
else.  We  perceive  a  very  narrow  slice  of  a  causally  interconnected  matrix, 
although  we  strive  with  all  our  might  to  avoid  being  confronted  by  knowledge  of 
that  narrowness.  The  thin  veneer  of  perceptual  sufficiency  cracks,  however, 
when  something  fundamental  goes  wrong.  The  dreadful  inadequacy  of  our 
senses  reveals  itself.  Everything  we  hold  dear  crumbles  to  dust.  We  freeze.  We 
turn  to  stone.  What  then  do  we  see?  Where  can  we  look,  when  it  is  precisely 
what  we  see  that  has  been  insufficient? 

What  Do  We  See  When  We  Don’t  Know  What  We’re  Looking  At? 

What  is  it,  that  is  the  world,  after  the  Twin  Towers  disintegrate?  What,  if 
anything,  is  left  standing?  What  dread  beast  rises  from  the  ruins  when  the 
invisible  pillars  supporting  the  world’s  financial  system  tremble  and  fall?  What 
do  we  see  when  we  are  swept  up  in  the  fire  and  drama  of  a  National  Socialist 
rally,  or  cower,  paralyzed  with  fear,  in  the  midst  of  a  massacre  in  Rwanda?  What 
is  it  that  we  see,  when  we  cannot  understand  what  is  happening  to  us,  cannot 
determine  where  we  are,  know  no  longer  who  we  are,  and  no  longer  understand 
what  surrounds  us?  What  we  don ’t  see  is  the  well-known  and  comforting  world 
of  tools — of  useful  objects — of  personalities.  We  don’t  even  see  familiar 
obstacles — sufficiently  troubling  though  they  are  in  normal  times,  already 
mastered — that  we  can  simply  step  around. 

What  we  perceive,  when  things  fall  apart,  is  no  longer  the  stage  and  settings  of 
habitable  order.  It’s  the  eternal  watery  tohu  va  bohu,  formless  emptiness,  and  the 


tehom,  the  abyss,  to  speak  biblically — the  chaos  forever  lurking  beneath  our  thin 
surfaces  of  security.  It’s  from  that  chaos  that  the  Holy  Word  of  God  Himself 
extracted  order  at  the  beginning  of  time,  according  to  the  oldest  opinions 
expressed  by  mankind  (and  it  is  in  the  image  of  that  same  Word  that  we  were 
made,  male  and  female,  according  to  the  same  opinions).  It’s  from  that  chaos 
that  whatever  stability  we  had  the  good  fortune  to  experience  emerged, 
originally — for  some  limited  time — when  we  first  learned  to  perceive.  It’s  chaos 
that  we  see,  when  things  fall  apart  (even  though  we  cannot  truly  see  it).  What 
does  all  this  mean? 

Emergency — emergence(y).  This  is  the  sudden  manifestation  from  somewhere 
unknown  of  some  previously  unknown  phenomenon  (from  the  Greek 
phainesthai,  to  “shine  forth”).  This  is  the  reappearance  of  the  eternal  dragon, 
from  its  eternal  cavern,  from  its  now-disrupted  slumber.  This  is  the  underworld, 
with  its  monsters  rising  from  the  depths.  How  do  we  prepare  for  an  emergency, 
when  we  do  not  know  what  has  emerged,  or  from  where?  How  do  we  prepare  for 
catastrophe,  when  we  do  not  know  what  to  expect,  or  how  to  act?  We  turn  from 
our  minds,  so  to  speak — too  slow,  too  ponderous — to  our  bodies.  Our  bodies 
react  much  faster  than  our  minds. 

When  things  collapse  around  us  our  perception  disappears,  and  we  act. 

Ancient  reflexive  responses,  rendered  automatic  and  efficient  over  hundreds  of 
millions  of  years,  protect  us  in  those  dire  moments  when  not  only  thought  but 
perception  itself  fails.  Under  such  circumstances,  our  bodies  ready  themselves 
for  all  possible  eventualities.  First,  we  freeze.  The  reflexes  of  the  body  then 
shade  into  emotion,  the  next  stage  of  perception.  Is  this  something  scary? 
Something  useful?  Something  that  must  be  fought?  Something  that  can  be 
ignored?  How  will  we  determine  this — and  when?  We  don’t  know.  Now  we  are 
in  a  costly  and  demanding  state  of  readiness.  Our  bodies  are  flooded  with 
cortisol  and  adrenaline.  Our  hearts  beat  faster.  Our  breath  quickens.  We  realize, 
painfully,  that  our  sense  of  competence  and  completeness  is  gone;  it  was  just  a 
dream.  We  draw  on  physical  and  psychological  resources  saved  carefully  for  just 
this  moment  (if  we  are  fortunate  enough  to  have  them).  We  prepare  for  the  worst 
— or  the  best.  We  push  the  gas  pedal  furiously  to  the  floor,  and  slam  on  the 
brakes  at  the  same  time.  We  scream,  or  laugh.  We  look  disgusted,  or  terrified. 

We  cry.  And  then  we  begin  to  parse  apart  the  chaos. 

And  so,  the  deceived  wife,  increasingly  unhinged,  feels  the  motivation  to 
reveal  all — to  herself,  her  sister,  her  best  friend,  to  a  stranger  on  a  bus — or 
retreats  into  silence,  and  ruminates  obsessively,  to  the  same  end.  What  went 
wrong?  What  did  she  do  that  was  so  unforgivable?  Who  is  this  person  she  has 
been  living  with?  What  kind  of  world  is  this,  where  such  things  can  happen? 


What  kind  of  God  would  make  such  a  place?  What  conversation  could  she 
possibly  initiate  with  this  new,  infuriating  person,  inhabiting  the  shell  of  her 
former  husband?  What  forms  of  revenge  might  satisfy  her  anger?  Who  could  she 
seduce,  in  return  for  this  insult?  She  is  by  turns  enraged,  terrified,  struck  down 
by  pain,  and  exhilarated  by  the  possibilities  of  her  new-found  freedom. 

Her  last  place  of  bedrock  security  was  in  fact  not  stable,  not  certain — not 
bedrock  at  all.  Her  house  was  built  on  a  foundation  of  sand.  The  ice  she  was 
skating  on  was  simply  too  thin.  She  fell  through,  into  the  water  below,  and  is 
drowning.  She  has  been  hit  so  hard  that  her  anger,  terror  and  grief  consume  her. 
Her  sense  of  betrayal  widens,  until  the  whole  world  caves  in.  Where  is  she?  In 
the  underworld,  with  all  its  terrors.  How  did  she  get  there?  This  experience,  this 
voyage  into  the  substructure  of  things — this  is  all  perception,  too,  in  its  nascent 
form;  this  preparation;  this  consideration  of  what-might-have-been  and  what- 
could-still-be;  this  emotion  and  fantasy.  This  is  all  the  deep  perception  now 
necessary  before  the  familiar  objects  that  she  once  knew  reappear,  if  they  ever 
do,  in  their  simplified  and  comfortable  form.  This  is  perception  before  the  chaos 
of  possibility  is  re-articulated  into  the  functional  realities  of  order. 

“Was  it  really  so  unexpected?”  she  asks  herself — she  asks  others — thinking 
back.  Should  she  now  feel  guilty  about  ignoring  the  warning  signs,  subtle  though 
they  may  have  been,  encouraged  though  she  was  to  avoid  them?  She  remembers 
when  she  first  married,  eagerly  joining  her  husband,  every  single  night,  to  make 
love.  Perhaps  that  was  too  much  to  expect — or  even  too  much  to  cope  with — but 
once,  in  the  last  six  months?  Once  every  two  or  three  months,  for  years,  before 
that?  Would  anyone  she  could  truly  respect — including  herself — put  up  with 
such  a  situation? 

There  is  a  story  for  children,  There’s  No  Such  Thing  as  a  Dragon,  by  Jack 
Kent,  that  I  really  like.  It’s  a  very  simple  tale,  at  least  on  the  surface.  I  once  read 
its  few  pages  to  a  group  of  retired  University  of  Toronto  alumni,  and  explained 
its  symbolic  meaning. fn2  It’s  about  a  small  boy,  Billy  Bixbee,  who  spies  a  dragon 
sitting  on  his  bed  one  morning.  It’s  about  the  size  of  a  house  cat,  and  friendly.  He 
tells  his  mother  about  it,  but  she  tells  him  that  there’s  no  such  thing  as  a  dragon. 
So,  it  starts  to  grow.  It  eats  all  of  Billy’s  pancakes.  Soon  it  fills  the  whole  house. 
Mom  tries  to  vacuum,  but  she  has  to  go  in  and  out  of  the  house  through  the 
windows  because  of  the  dragon  everywhere.  It  takes  her  forever.  Then,  the 
dragon  runs  off  with  the  house.  Billy’s  dad  comes  home — and  there’s  just  an 
empty  space,  where  he  used  to  live.  The  mailman  tells  him  where  the  house 
went.  He  chases  after  it,  climbs  up  the  dragon’s  head  and  neck  (now  sprawling 
out  into  the  street)  and  rejoins  his  wife  and  son.  Mom  still  insists  that  the  dragon 
does  not  exist,  but  Billy,  who’s  pretty  much  had  it  by  now,  insists,  “There  is  a 


dragon,  Mom.”  Instantly,  it  starts  to  shrink.  Soon,  it’s  cat-sized  again.  Everyone 
agrees  that  dragons  of  that  size  (1)  exist  and  (2)  are  much  preferable  to  their 
gigantic  counterparts.  Mom,  eyes  reluctantly  opened  by  this  point,  asks 
somewhat  plaintively  why  it  had  to  get  so  big.  Billy  quietly  suggests:  “maybe  it 
wanted  to  be  noticed.” 

Maybe!  That’s  the  moral  of  many,  many  stories.  Chaos  emerges  in  a 
household,  bit  by  bit.  Mutual  unhappiness  and  resentment  pile  up.  Everything 
untidy  is  swept  under  the  rug,  where  the  dragon  feasts  on  the  crumbs.  But  no  one 
says  anything,  as  the  shared  society  and  negotiated  order  of  the  household 
reveals  itself  as  inadequate,  or  disintegrates,  in  the  face  of  the  unexpected  and 
threatening.  Everybody  whistles  in  the  dark,  instead.  Communication  would 
require  admission  of  terrible  emotions:  resentment,  terror,  loneliness,  despair, 
jealousy,  frustration,  hatred,  boredom.  Moment  by  moment,  it’s  easier  to  keep 
the  peace.  But  in  the  background,  in  Billy  Bixbee’s  house,  and  in  all  that  are  like 
it,  the  dragon  grows.  One  day  it  bursts  forth,  in  a  form  that  no  one  can  ignore.  It 
lifts  the  very  household  from  its  foundations.  Then  it’s  an  affair,  or  a  decades- 
long  custody  dispute  of  ruinous  economic  and  psychological  proportions.  Then 
it’s  the  concentrated  version  of  the  acrimony  that  could  have  been  spread  out, 
tolerably,  issue  by  issue,  over  the  years  of  the  pseudo-paradise  of  the  marriage. 
Every  one  of  the  three  hundred  thousand  unrevealed  issues,  which  have  been 
lied  about,  avoided,  rationalized  away,  hidden  like  an  army  of  skeletons  in  some 
great  horrific  closet,  bursts  forth  like  Noah’s  flood,  drowning  everything.  There’s 
no  ark,  because  no  one  built  one,  even  though  everyone  felt  the  storm  gathering. 

Don’t  ever  underestimate  the  destructive  power  of  sins  of  omission. 

Maybe  the  demolished  couple  could  have  had  a  conversation,  or  two,  or  two 
hundred,  about  their  sex  lives.  Maybe  the  physical  intimacy  they  undoubtedly 
shared  should  have  been  matched,  as  it  often  is  not,  by  a  corresponding 
psychological  intimacy.  Maybe  they  could  have  fought  through  their  roles.  In 
many  households,  in  recent  decades,  the  traditional  household  division  of  labour 
has  been  demolished,  not  least  in  the  name  of  liberation  and  freedom.  That 
demolition,  however,  has  not  left  so  much  glorious  lack  of  restriction  in  its  wake 
as  chaos,  conflict  and  indeterminacy.  The  escape  from  tyranny  is  often  followed 
not  by  Paradise,  but  by  a  sojourn  in  the  desert,  aimless,  confused  and  deprived. 
Furthermore,  in  the  absence  of  agreed-upon  tradition  (and  the  constraints — often 
uncomfortable;  often  even  unreasonable — that  it  imposes)  there  exist  only  three 
difficult  options:  slavery,  tyranny  or  negotiation.  The  slave  merely  does  what  he 
or  she  is  told — happy,  perhaps,  to  shed  the  responsibility — and  solves  the 
problem  of  complexity  in  that  manner.  But  it’s  a  temporary  solution.  The  spirit 
of  the  slave  rebels.  The  tyrant  merely  tells  the  slave  what  to  do,  and  solves  the 


problem  of  complexity  in  that  manner.  But  it’s  a  temporary  solution.  The  tyrant 
tires  of  the  slave.  There’s  nothing  and  no  one  there,  except  for  predictable  and 
sullen  obedience.  Who  can  live  forever  with  that?  But  negotiation — that  requires 
forthright  admission  on  the  part  of  both  players  that  the  dragon  exists.  That’s  a 
reality  difficult  to  face,  even  when  it’s  still  too  small  to  simply  devour  the  knight 
who  dares  confront  it. 

Maybe  the  demolished  couple  could  have  more  precisely  specified  their 
desired  manner  of  Being.  Maybe  in  that  manner  they  could  have  jointly 
prevented  the  waters  of  chaos  from  springing  uncontrollably  forth  and  drowning 
them.  Maybe  they  could  have  done  that  instead  of  saying,  in  the  agreeable,  lazy 
and  cowardly  way:  “It’s  OK.  It’s  not  worth  fighting  about.”  There  is  little,  in  a 
marriage,  that  is  so  little  that  it  is  not  worth  fighting  about.  You’re  stuck  in  a 
marriage  like  the  two  proverbial  cats  in  a  barrel,  bound  by  the  oath  that  lasts  in 
theory  until  one  or  both  of  you  die.  That  oath  is  there  to  make  you  take  the  damn 
situation  seriously.  Do  you  really  want  the  same  petty  annoyance  tormenting  you 
every  single  day  of  your  marriage,  for  the  decades  of  its  existence? 

“Oh,  I  can  put  up  with  it,”  you  think.  And  maybe  you  should.  You’re  no 
paragon  of  genuine  tolerance.  And  maybe  if  you  brought  up  how  your  partner’s 
giddy  laugh  is  beginning  to  sound  like  nails  on  a  blackboard  he  (or  she)  would 
tell  you,  quite  properly,  to  go  to  hell.  And  maybe  the  fault  is  with  you,  and  you 
should  grow  up,  get  yourself  together  and  keep  quiet.  But  perhaps  braying  like  a 
donkey  in  the  midst  of  a  social  gathering  is  not  reflecting  well  on  your  partner, 
and  you  should  stick  to  your  guns.  Under  such  circumstances,  there  is  nothing 
but  a  fight — a  fight  with  peace  as  the  goal — that  will  reveal  the  truth.  But  you 
remain  silent,  and  you  convince  yourself  it’s  because  you  are  a  good,  peace- 
loving,  patient  person  (and  nothing  could  be  further  from  the  truth).  And  the 
monster  under  the  rug  gains  a  few  more  pounds. 

Maybe  a  forthright  conversation  about  sexual  dissatisfaction  might  have  been 
the  proverbial  stitch  in  time — not  that  it  would  be  easy.  Perhaps  madame  desired 
the  death  of  intimacy,  clandestinely,  because  she  was  deeply  and  secretly 
ambivalent  about  sex.  God  knows  there’s  reason  to  be.  Perhaps  monsieur  was  a 
terrible,  selfish  lover.  Maybe  they  both  were.  Sorting  that  out  is  worth  a  fight, 
isn’t  it?  That’s  a  big  part  of  life,  isn’t  it?  Perhaps  addressing  that  and  (you  never 
know)  solving  the  problem  would  be  worth  two  months  of  pure  misery  just 
telling  each  other  the  truth  (not  with  intent  to  destroy,  or  attain  victory,  because 
that’s  not  the  truth:  that’s  just  all-out  war). 

Maybe  it  wasn’t  sex.  Maybe  every  conversation  between  husband  and  wife 
had  deteriorated  into  boring  routine,  as  no  shared  adventure  animated  the  couple. 
Maybe  that  deterioration  was  easier,  moment  by  moment,  day  by  day,  than 


bearing  the  responsibility  of  keeping  the  relationship  alive.  Living  things  die, 
after  all,  without  attention.  Life  is  indistinguishable  from  effortful  maintenance. 
No  one  finds  a  match  so  perfect  that  the  need  for  continued  attention  and  work 
vanishes  (and,  besides,  if  you  found  the  perfect  person,  he  or  she  would  run 
away  from  ever-so-imperfect  you  in  justifiable  horror).  In  truth,  what  you  need 
— what  you  deserve,  after  all — is  someone  exactly  as  imperfect  as  you. 

Maybe  the  husband  who  betrayed  his  wife  was  appallingly  immature  and 
selfish.  Maybe  that  selfishness  got  the  upper  hand.  Maybe  she  did  not  oppose 
this  tendency  with  enough  force  and  vigour.  Maybe  she  could  not  agree  with  him 
on  the  proper  disciplinary  approach  to  the  children,  and  shut  him  out  of  their 
lives,  in  consequence.  Maybe  that  allowed  him  to  circumvent  what  he  saw  as  an 
unpleasant  responsibility.  Maybe  hatred  brewed  in  the  hearts  of  the  children, 
watching  this  underground  battle,  punished  by  the  resentment  of  their  mother 
and  alienated,  bit  by  bit,  from  good  old  Dad.  Maybe  the  dinners  she  prepared  for 
him — or  he  for  her — were  cold  and  bitterly  eaten.  Maybe  all  that  unaddressed 
conflict  left  both  resentful,  in  a  manner  unspoken,  but  effectively  enacted. 

Maybe  all  that  unspoken  trouble  started  to  undermine  the  invisible  networks  that 
supported  the  marriage.  Maybe  respect  slowly  turned  into  contempt,  and  no  one 
deigned  to  notice.  Maybe  love  slowly  turned  into  hate,  without  mention. 

Everything  clarified  and  articulated  becomes  visible;  maybe  neither  wife  nor 
husband  wished  to  see  or  understand.  Maybe  they  left  things  purposefully  in  the 
fog.  Maybe  they  generated  the  fog,  to  hide  what  they  did  not  want  to  see.  What 
did  missus  gain,  when  she  turned  from  mistress  to  maid  or  mother?  Was  it  a 
relief  when  her  sex  life  disappeared?  Could  she  complain  more  profitably  to  the 
neighbours  and  her  mother  when  her  husband  turned  away?  Maybe  that  was 
more  gratifying,  secretly,  than  anything  good  that  could  be  derived  from  any 
marriage,  no  matter  how  perfect.  What  can  possibly  compare  to  the  pleasures  of 
sophisticated  and  well-practised  martyrdom?  “She’s  such  a  saint,  and  married  to 
such  a  terrible  man.  She  deserved  much  better.”  That’s  a  gratifying  myth  to  live 
by,  even  if  unconsciously  chosen  (the  truth  of  the  situation  be  damned).  Maybe 
she  never  really  liked  her  husband.  Maybe  she  never  really  liked  men,  and  still 
doesn’t.  Maybe  that  was  her  mother’s  fault — or  her  grandmother’s.  Maybe  she 
mimicked  their  behaviour,  acting  out  their  trouble,  transmitted  unconsciously, 
implicitly,  down  the  generations.  Maybe  she  was  taking  revenge  on  her  father,  or 
her  brother,  or  society. 

What  did  her  husband  gain,  for  his  part,  when  his  sex  life  at  home  died?  Did 
he  willingly  play  along,  as  martyr,  and  complain  bitterly  to  his  friends?  Did  he 
use  it  as  the  excuse  he  wanted  anyway  to  search  for  a  new  lover?  Did  he  use  it  to 
justify  the  resentment  he  still  felt  towards  women,  in  general,  for  the  rejections 


he  had  faced  so  continuously  before  falling  into  his  marriage?  Did  he  seize  the 
opportunity  to  get  effortlessly  fat  and  lazy  because  he  wasn’t  desired,  in  any 
case? 

Maybe  both,  wife  and  husband  alike,  used  the  opportunity  to  mess  up  their 
marriage  to  take  revenge  upon  God  (perhaps  the  one  Being  who  could  have 
sorted  through  the  mess). 

Here’s  the  terrible  truth  about  such  matters:  every  single  voluntarily 
unprocessed  and  uncomprehended  and  ignored  reason  for  marital  failure  will 
compound  and  conspire  and  will  then  plague  that  betrayed  and  self-betrayed 
woman  for  the  rest  of  her  life.  The  same  goes  for  her  husband.  All  she — he — 
they — or  we — must  do  to  ensure  such  an  outcome  is  nothing :  don’t  notice,  don’t 
react,  don ’t  attend,  don ’t  discuss,  don ’t  consider,  don ’t  work  for  peace,  don ’t  take 
responsibility.  Don’t  confront  the  chaos  and  turn  it  into  order — just  wait, 
anything  but  naive  and  innocent,  for  the  chaos  to  rise  up  and  engulf  you  instead. 

Why  avoid,  when  avoidance  necessarily  and  inevitably  poisons  the  future? 
Because  the  possibility  of  a  monster  lurks  underneath  all  disagreements  and 
errors.  Maybe  the  fight  you  are  having  (or  not  having)  with  your  wife  or  your 
husband  signifies  the  beginning  of  the  end  of  your  relationship.  Maybe  your 
relationship  is  ending  because  you  are  a  bad  person.  It’s  likely,  at  least  in  part. 
Isn’t  it?  Having  the  argument  necessary  to  solve  a  real  problem  therefore 
necessitates  willingness  to  confront  two  forms  of  miserable  and  dangerous 
potential  simultaneously:  chaos  (the  potential  fragility  of  the  relationship — of  all 
relationships — of  life  itself)  and  Hell  (the  fact  that  you — and  your  partner — 
could  each  be  the  person  bad  enough  to  ruin  everything  with  your  laziness  and 
spite).  There’s  every  motivation  to  avoid.  But  it  doesn’t  help. 

Why  remain  vague,  when  it  renders  life  stagnant  and  murky?  Well,  if  you 
don’t  know  who  you  are,  you  can  hide  in  doubt.  Maybe  you’re  not  a  bad, 
careless,  worthless  person.  Who  knows?  Not  you.  Particularly  if  you  refuse  to 
think  about  it — and  you  have  every  reason  not  to.  But  not  thinking  about 
something  you  don’t  want  to  know  about  doesn’t  make  it  go  away.  You  are 
merely  trading  specific,  particular,  pointed  knowledge  of  the  likely  finite  list  of 
your  real  faults  and  flaws  for  a  much  longer  list  of  undefined  potential 
inadequacies  and  insufficiencies. 

Why  refuse  to  investigate,  when  knowledge  of  reality  enables  mastery  of 
reality  (and  if  not  mastery,  at  least  the  stature  of  an  honest  amateur)?  Well,  what 
if  there  truly  is  something  rotten  in  the  state  of  Denmark?  Then  what?  Isn’t  it 
better  under  such  conditions  to  live  in  willful  blindness  and  enjoy  the  bliss  of 
ignorance?  Well,  not  if  the  monster  is  real!  Do  you  truly  think  it  is  a  good  idea  to 
retreat,  to  abandon  the  possibility  of  arming  yourself  against  the  rising  sea  of 


troubles,  and  to  thereby  diminish  yourself  in  your  own  eyes?  Do  you  truly  think 
it  wise  to  let  the  catastrophe  grow  in  the  shadows,  while  you  shrink  and  decrease 
and  become  ever  more  afraid?  Isn’t  it  better  to  prepare,  to  sharpen  your  sword,  to 
peer  into  the  darkness,  and  then  to  beard  the  lion  in  its  den?  Maybe  you’ll  get 
hurt.  Probably  you’ll  get  hurt.  Life,  after  all,  is  suffering.  But  maybe  the  wound 
won’t  be  fatal. 

If  you  wait  instead  until  what  you  are  refusing  to  investigate  comes  a- 
knocking  at  your  door,  things  will  certainly  not  go  so  well  for  you.  What  you 
least  want  will  inevitably  happen — and  when  you  are  least  prepared.  What  you 
least  want  to  encounter  will  make  itself  manifest  when  you  are  weakest  and  it  is 
strongest.  And  you  will  be  defeated. 

Turning  and  turning  in  the  widening  gyre 
The  falcon  cannot  hear  the  falconer; 

Things  fall  apart;  the  centre  cannot  hold; 

Mere  anarchy  is  loosed  upon  the  world, 

The  blood-dimmed  tide  is  loosed,  and  everywhere 
The  ceremony  of  innocence  is  drowned; 

The  best  lack  all  conviction,  while  the  worst 

Are  full  of  passionate  intensity. 

(William  Butler  Yeats,  “The  Second  Coming”) 

Why  refuse  to  specify,  when  specifying  the  problem  would  enable  its  solution? 
Because  to  specify  the  problem  is  to  admit  that  it  exists.  Because  to  specify  the 
problem  is  to  allow  yourself  to  know  what  you  want,  say,  from  friend  or  lover — 
and  then  you  will  know,  precisely  and  cleanly,  when  you  don’t  get  it,  and  that 
will  hurt,  sharply  and  specifically.  But  you  will  learn  something  from  that,  and 
use  what  you  learn  in  the  future — and  the  alternative  to  that  single  sharp  pain  is 
the  dull  ache  of  continued  hopelessness  and  vague  failure  and  the  sense  that 
time,  precious  time,  is  slipping  by. 

Why  refuse  to  specify?  Because  while  you  are  failing  to  define  success  (and 
thereby  rendering  it  impossible)  you  are  also  refusing  to  define  failure,  to 
yourself,  so  that  if  and  when  you  fail  you  won’t  notice,  and  it  won’t  hurt.  But 
that  won’t  work!  You  cannot  be  fooled  so  easily — unless  you  have  gone  very  far 
down  the  road!  You  will  instead  carry  with  you  a  continual  sense  of 
disappointment  in  your  own  Being  and  the  self-contempt  that  comes  along  with 
that  and  the  increasing  hatred  for  the  world  that  all  of  that  generates  (or 
degenerates). 

Surely  some  revelation  is  at  hand; 

Surely  the  Second  Coming  is  at  hand. 

The  Second  Coming!  Hardly  are  those  words  out 
When  a  vast  image  out  of  Spiritus  Mundi 
Troubles  my  sight:  somewhere  in  sands  of  the  desert 


A  shape  with  lion  body  and  the  head  of  a  man, 

A  gaze  blank  and  pitiless  as  the  sun, 

Is  moving  its  slow  thighs,  while  all  about  it 
Reel  shadows  of  the  indignant  desert  birds. 

The  darkness  drops  again;  but  now  I  know 

That  twenty  centuries  of  stony  sleep 

Were  vexed  to  nightmare  by  a  rocking  cradle, 

And  what  rough  beast,  its  hour  come  round  at  last, 

Slouches  towards  Bethlehem  to  be  born? 

What  if  she  who  has  been  betrayed,  now  driven  by  desperation,  is  now 
determined  to  face  all  the  incoherence  of  past,  present  and  future?  What  if  she 
decided  to  sort  through  the  mess,  even  though  she  has  avoided  doing  so  until 
now,  and  is  all  the  weaker  and  more  confused  for  it?  Perhaps  the  effort  will 
nearly  kill  her  (but  she  is  now  on  a  path  worse  than  death  in  any  case).  To  re- 
emerge,  to  escape,  to  be  reborn,  she  must  thoughtfully  articulate  the  reality  she 
comfortably  but  dangerously  left  hidden  behind  a  veil  of  ignorance  and  the 
pretence  of  peace.  She  must  separate  the  particular  details  of  her  specific 
catastrophe  from  the  intolerable  general  condition  of  Being,  in  a  world  where 
everything  has  fallen  apart.  Everything — that’s  far  too  much.  It  was  specific 
things  that  fell  apart,  not  everything;  identifiable  beliefs  failed;  particular 
actions  were  false  and  inauthentic.  What  were  they?  How  can  they  be  fixed, 
now?  How  can  she  be  better,  in  the  future?  She  will  never  return  to  dry  land  if 
she  refuses  or  is  unable  to  figure  it  all  out.  She  can  put  the  world  back  together 
by  some  precision  of  thought,  some  precision  of  speech,  some  reliance  on  her 
word,  some  reliance  on  the  Word.  But  perhaps  it’s  better  to  leave  things  in  the 
fog.  Perhaps  by  now  there  just  isn’t  enough  left  of  her — perhaps  too  much  of  her 
has  been  left  unrevealed,  undeveloped.  Maybe  she  simply  no  longer  has  the 
energy.... 

Some  earlier  care  and  courage  and  honesty  in  expression  might  have  saved  her 
from  all  this  trouble.  What  if  she  had  communicated  her  unhappiness  with  the 
decline  of  her  romantic  life,  right  when  it  started  to  decline?  Precisely,  exactly, 
when  that  decline  first  bothered  her?  Or,  if  it  didn’t  bother  her — what  if  she  had 
instead  communicated  the  fact  it  didn’t  bother  her  as  much  as  it  perhaps  should 
have?  What  if  she  had  clearly  and  carefully  confronted  the  fact  of  our  husband’s 
contempt  for  her  household  efforts?  Would  she  have  discovered  her  resentment 
of  her  father  and  society  itself  (and  the  consequent  contamination  of  her 
relationships)?  What  if  she  had  fixed  all  that?  How  much  stronger  would  she 
then  have  become?  How  much  less  likely  to  avoid  facing  up  to  difficulties,  in 
consequence?  How  might  she  then  have  served  herself,  her  family,  and  the 
world? 


What  if  she  had  continually  and  honestly  risked  conflict  in  the  present,  in  the 
service  of  longer-term  truth  and  peace?  What  if  she  had  treated  the  micro¬ 
collapses  of  her  marriage  as  evidence  of  an  underlying  instability,  eminently 
worthy  of  attention,  instead  of  ignoring  them,  putting  up  with  them,  or  smiling 
through  them,  in  such  a  nice,  agreeable  manner?  Maybe  she  would  be  different, 
and  her  husband,  different  too.  Maybe  they  would  still  be  married,  formally  and 
in  spirit.  Maybe  they  would  both  be  much  younger,  physically  and  mentally,  than 
they  are  now.  Maybe  her  house  would  have  been  founded  more  on  rock  and  less 
on  sand. 

When  things  fall  apart,  and  chaos  re-emerges,  we  can  give  structure  to  it,  and 
re-establish  order,  through  our  speech.  If  we  speak  carefully  and  precisely,  we 
can  sort  things  out,  and  put  them  in  their  proper  place,  and  set  a  new  goal,  and 
navigate  to  it — often  communally,  if  we  negotiate;  if  we  reach  consensus.  If  we 
speak  carelessly  and  imprecisely,  however,  things  remain  vague.  The  destination 
remains  unproclaimed.  The  fog  of  uncertainty  does  not  lift,  and  there  is  no 
negotiating  through  the  world. 

The  Construction  of  Soul  and  World 

The  psyche  (the  soul)  and  the  world  are  both  organized,  at  the  highest  levels  of 
human  existence,  with  language,  through  communication.  Things  are  not  as  they 
appear  when  the  outcome  has  been  neither  intended  nor  desired.  Being  has  not 
been  sorted  into  its  proper  categories,  when  it  is  not  behaving.  When  something 
goes  wrong,  even  perception  itself  must  be  questioned,  along  with  evaluation, 
thought  and  action.  When  error  announces  itself,  undifferentiated  chaos  is  at 
hand.  Its  reptilian  form  paralyzes  and  confuses.  But  dragons,  which  do  exist 
(perhaps  more  than  anything  else  exists)  also  hoard  gold.  In  that  collapse  into  the 
terrible  mess  of  uncomprehended  Being  lurks  the  possibility  of  new  and 
benevolent  order.  Clarity  of  thought — courageous  clarity  of  thought — is 
necessary  to  call  it  forth. 

The  problem  itself  must  be  admitted  to,  as  close  to  the  time  of  its  emergence 
as  possible.  “I’m  unhappy,”  is  a  good  start  (not  “I  have  a  right  to  be  unhappy,” 
because  that  is  still  questionable,  at  the  beginning  of  the  problem-solving 
process).  Perhaps  your  unhappiness  is  justified,  under  the  current  circumstances. 
Perhaps  any  reasonable  person  would  be  displeased  and  miserable  to  be  where 
you  are.  Alternatively,  perhaps,  you  are  just  whiny  and  immature?  Consider  both 
at  least  equally  probable,  as  terrible  as  such  consideration  might  appear.  Just 
exactly  how  immature  might  you  be?  There’s  a  potentially  bottomless  pit.  But  at 
least  you  might  rectify  it,  if  you  can  admit  to  it. 


We  parse  the  complex,  tangled  chaos,  and  specify  the  nature  of  things, 
including  ourselves.  It  is  in  this  way  that  our  creative,  communicative 
exploration  continually  generates  and  regenerates  the  world.  We  are  shaped  and 
informed  by  what  we  voluntarily  encounter,  and  we  shape  what  we  inhabit,  as 
well,  in  that  encounter.  This  is  difficult,  but  the  difficulty  is  not  relevant,  because 
the  alternative  is  worse. 

Maybe  our  errant  husband  ignored  the  dinner  conversation  of  his  wife  because 
he  hated  his  job  and  was  tired  and  resentful.  Maybe  he  hated  his  job  because  his 
career  was  forced  on  him  by  his  father  and  he  was  too  weak  or  “loyal”  to  object. 
Maybe  she  put  up  with  his  lack  of  attention  because  she  believed  that  forthright 
objection  itself  was  rude  and  immoral.  Maybe  she  hated  her  own  father’s  anger 
and  decided,  when  very  young,  that  all  aggression  and  assertiveness  were 
morally  wrong.  Maybe  she  thought  her  husband  wouldn’t  love  her  if  she  had  any 
opinions  of  her  own.  It  is  very  difficult  to  put  such  things  in  order — but  damaged 
machinery  will  continue  to  malfunction  if  its  problems  are  neither  diagnosed  nor 
fixed. 

Wheat  from  Chaff 

Precision  specifies.  When  something  terrible  happens,  it  is  precision  that 
separates  the  unique  terrible  thing  that  has  actually  happened  from  all  the  other, 
equally  terrible  things  that  might  have  happened — but  did  not.  If  you  wake  up  in 
pain,  you  might  be  dying.  You  might  be  dying  slowly  and  terribly  from  one  of  a 
diverse  number  of  painful,  horrible  diseases.  If  you  refuse  to  tell  your  doctor 
about  your  pain,  then  what  you  have  is  unspecified:  it  could  be  any  of  those 
diseases — and  it  certainly  (since  you  have  avoided  the  diagnostic  conversation — 
the  act  of  articulation)  is  something  unspeakable.  But  if  you  talk  to  your  doctor, 
all  those  terrible  possible  diseases  will  collapse,  with  luck,  into  just  one  terrible 
(or  not  so  terrible)  disease,  or  even  into  nothing.  Then  you  can  laugh  at  your 
previous  fears,  and  if  something  really  is  wrong,  well,  you’re  prepared.  Precision 
may  leave  the  tragedy  intact,  but  it  chases  away  the  ghouls  and  the  demons. 

What  you  hear  in  the  forest  but  cannot  see  might  be  a  tiger.  It  might  even  be  a 
conspiracy  of  tigers,  each  hungrier  and  more  vicious  than  the  other,  led  by  a 
crocodile.  But  it  might  not  be,  too.  If  you  turn  and  look,  perhaps  you’ll  see  that 
it’s  just  a  squirrel.  (I  know  someone  who  was  actually  chased  by  a  squirrel.) 
Something  is  out  there  in  the  woods.  You  know  that  with  certainty.  But  often  it’s 
only  a  squirrel.  If  you  refuse  to  look,  however,  then  it’s  a  dragon,  and  you’re  no 
knight:  you’re  a  mouse  confronting  a  lion;  a  rabbit,  paralyzed  by  the  gaze  of  a 
wolf.  And  I  am  not  saying  that  it’s  always  a  squirrel.  Often  it’s  something  truly 


terrible.  But  even  what  is  terrible  in  actuality  often  pales  in  significance 
compared  to  what  is  terrible  in  imagination.  And  often  what  cannot  be 
confronted  because  of  its  horror  in  imagination  can  in  fact  be  confronted  when 
reduced  to  its-still-admittedly-terrible  actuality. 

If  you  shirk  the  responsibility  of  confronting  the  unexpected,  even  when  it 
appears  in  manageable  doses,  reality  itself  will  become  unsustainably 
disorganized  and  chaotic.  Then  it  will  grow  bigger  and  swallow  all  order,  all 
sense,  and  all  predictability.  Ignored  reality  transforms  itself  (reverts  back)  into 
the  great  Goddess  of  Chaos,  the  great  reptilian  Monster  of  the  Unknown — the 
great  predatory  beast  against  which  mankind  has  struggled  since  the  dawn  of 
time.  If  the  gap  between  pretence  and  reality  goes  unmentioned,  it  will  widen, 
you  will  fall  into  it,  and  the  consequences  will  not  be  good.  Ignored  reality 
manifests  itself  in  an  abyss  of  confusion  and  suffering. 

Be  careful  with  what  you  tell  yourself  and  others  about  what  you  have  done, 
what  you  are  doing,  and  where  you  are  going.  Search  for  the  correct  words. 
Organize  those  words  into  the  correct  sentences,  and  those  sentences  into  the 
correct  paragraphs.  The  past  can  be  redeemed,  when  reduced  by  precise 
language  to  its  essence.  The  present  can  flow  by  without  robbing  the  future  if  its 
realities  are  spoken  out  clearly.  With  careful  thought  and  language,  the  singular, 
stellar  destiny  that  justifies  existence  can  be  extracted  from  the  multitude  of 
murky  and  unpleasant  futures  that  are  far  more  likely  to  manifest  themselves  of 
their  own  accord.  This  is  how  the  Eye  and  the  Word  make  habitable  order. 

Don’t  hide  baby  monsters  under  the  carpet.  They  will  flourish.  They  will  grow 
large  in  the  dark.  Then,  when  you  least  expect  it,  they  will  jump  out  and  devour 
you.  You  will  descend  into  an  indeterminate,  confusing  hell,  instead  of  ascending 
into  the  heaven  of  virtue  and  clarity.  Courageous  and  truthful  words  will  render 
your  reality  simple,  pristine,  well-defined  and  habitable. 

If  you  identify  things,  with  careful  attention  and  language,  you  bring  them 
forward  as  viable,  obedient  objects,  detaching  them  from  their  underlying  near- 
universal  interconnectedness.  You  simplify  them.  You  make  them  specific  and 
useful,  and  reduce  their  complexity.  You  make  it  possible  to  live  with  them  and 
use  them  without  dying  from  that  complexity,  with  its  attendant  uncertainty  and 
anxiety.  If  you  leave  things  vague,  then  you’ll  never  know  what  is  one  thing  and 
what  is  another.  Everything  will  bleed  into  everything  else.  This  makes  the  world 
too  complex  to  be  managed. 

You  have  to  consciously  define  the  topic  of  a  conversation,  particularly  when 
it  is  difficult — or  it  becomes  about  everything,  and  everything  is  too  much.  This 
is  so  frequently  why  couples  cease  communicating.  Every  argument  degenerates 
into  every  problem  that  ever  emerged  in  the  past,  every  problem  that  exists  now, 


and  every  terrible  thing  that  is  likely  to  happen  in  the  future.  No  one  can  have  a 
discussion  about  “everything.”  Instead,  you  can  say,  “This  exact,  precise  thing — 
that  is  what  is  making  me  unhappy.  This  exact,  precise  thing — that  is  what  I 
want,  as  an  alternative  (although  I  am  open  to  suggestions,  if  they  are  specific). 
This  exact,  precise  thing — that  is  what  you  could  deliver,  so  that  I  will  stop 
making  your  life  and  mine  miserable.”  But  to  do  that,  you  have  to  think :  What  is 
wrong,  exactly ?  What  do  I  want,  exactly ?  You  must  speak  forthrightly  and  call 
forth  the  habitable  world  from  chaos.  You  must  use  honest  precise  speech  to  do 
that.  If  instead  you  shrink  away  and  hide,  what  you  are  hiding  from  will 
transform  itself  into  the  giant  dragon  that  lurks  under  your  bed  and  in  your  forest 
and  in  the  dark  recesses  of  your  mind — and  it  will  devour  you. 

You  must  determine  where  you  have  been  in  your  life,  so  that  you  can  know 
where  you  are  now.  If  you  don’t  know  where  you  are,  precisely,  then  you  could 
be  anywhere.  Anywhere  is  too  many  places  to  be,  and  some  of  those  places  are 
very  bad.  You  must  determine  where  you  have  been  in  your  life,  because 
otherwise  you  can’t  get  to  where  you’re  going.  You  can’t  get  from  point  A  to 
point  B  unless  you  are  already  at  point  A,  and  if  you’re  just  “anywhere”  the 
chances  you  are  at  point  A  are  very  small  indeed. 

You  must  determine  where  you  are  going  in  your  life,  because  you  cannot  get 
there  unless  you  move  in  that  direction.  Random  wandering  will  not  move  you 
forward.  It  will  instead  disappoint  and  frustrate  you  and  make  you  anxious  and 
unhappy  and  hard  to  get  along  with  (and  then  resentful,  and  then  vengeful,  and 
then  worse). 

Say  what  you  mean,  so  that  you  can  find  out  what  you  mean.  Act  out  what 
you  say,  so  you  can  find  out  what  happens.  Then  pay  attention.  Note  your  errors. 
Articulate  them.  Strive  to  correct  them.  That  is  how  you  discover  the  meaning  of 
your  life.  That  will  protect  you  from  the  tragedy  of  your  life.  How  could  it  be 
otherwise? 

Confront  the  chaos  of  Being.  Take  aim  against  a  sea  of  troubles.  Specify  your 
destination,  and  chart  your  course.  Admit  to  what  you  want.  Tell  those  around 
you  who  you  are.  Narrow,  and  gaze  attentively,  and  move  forward,  forthrightly. 

Be  precise  in  your  speech. 


RULE  11 


DO  NOT  BOTHER  CHILDREN  WHEN  THEY  ARE 
SKATEBOARDING 

DANGER  AND  MASTERY 

There  was  a  time  when  kids  skateboarded  on  the  west  side  of  Sidney  Smith  Hall, 
at  the  University  of  Toronto,  where  I  work.  Sometimes  I  stood  there  and  watched 
them.  There  are  rough,  wide,  shallow  concrete  steps  there,  leading  up  from  the 
street  to  the  front  entrance,  accompanied  by  tubular  iron  handrails,  about  two 
and  a  half  inches  in  diameter  and  twenty  feet  long.  The  crazy  kids,  almost 
always  boys,  would  pull  back  about  fifteen  yards  from  the  top  of  the  steps.  Then 
they  would  place  a  foot  on  their  boards,  and  skate  like  mad  to  get  up  some  speed. 
Just  before  they  collided  with  the  handrail,  they  would  reach  down,  grab  their 
board  with  a  single  hand  and  jump  onto  the  top  of  the  rail,  boardsliding  their  way 
down  its  length,  propelling  themselves  off  and  landing — sometimes,  gracefully, 
still  atop  their  boards,  sometimes,  painfully,  off  them.  Either  way,  they  were 
soon  back  at  it. 

Some  might  call  that  stupid.  Maybe  it  was.  But  it  was  brave,  too.  I  thought 
those  kids  were  amazing.  I  thought  they  deserved  a  pat  on  the  back  and  some 
honest  admiration.  Of  course  it  was  dangerous.  Danger  was  the  point.  They 
wanted  to  triumph  over  danger.  They  would  have  been  safer  in  protective 
equipment,  but  that  would  have  ruined  it.  They  weren’t  trying  to  be  safe.  They 
were  trying  to  become  competent — and  it’s  competence  that  makes  people  as 
safe  as  they  can  truly  be. 

I  wouldn’t  dare  do  what  those  kids  were  doing.  Not  only  that,  I  couldn’t.  I 
certainly  couldn’t  climb  a  construction  crane,  like  a  certain  type  of  modern 
daredevil,  evident  on  YouTube  (and,  of  course,  people  who  work  on  construction 
cranes).  I  don’t  like  heights,  although  the  twenty-five  thousand  feet  to  which 
airliners  ascend  is  so  high  that  it  doesn’t  bother  me.  I  have  flown  several  times  in 
a  carbon  fibre  stunt  plane — even  doing  a  hammerhead  roll — and  that  was  OK, 
although  it’s  very  physically  and  mentally  demanding.  (To  perform  a 
hammerhead  roll,  you  pilot  the  plane  straight  up  vertically,  until  the  force  of 
gravity  makes  it  stall.  Then  it  falls  backwards,  corkscrewing,  until  eventually  it 
flips  and  noses  straight  down,  after  which  you  pull  out  of  the  dive.  Or  you  don’t 
do  another  hammerhead  roll.)  But  I  can’t  skateboard — especially  down  handrails 
— and  I  can’t  climb  cranes. 


Sidney  Smith  Hall  faces  another  street  on  the  east  side.  Along  that  street, 
named  St.  George — ironically  enough — the  university  installed  a  series  of  rough, 
hard-edged,  concrete  plant  boxes,  sloping  down  to  the  roadway.  The  kids  used  to 
go  out  there,  too,  and  boardslide  along  the  box  edges,  as  they  did  along  the 
concrete  surround  of  a  sculpture  adjacent  to  the  building.  That  didn’t  last  very 
long.  Little  steel  brackets  known  as  “skatestoppers”  soon  appeared,  every  two  or 
three  feet,  along  those  edges.  When  I  first  saw  them,  I  remembered  something 
that  happened  in  Toronto  several  years  previously.  Two  weeks  before  elementary 
school  classes  started,  throughout  the  city,  all  the  playground  equipment 
disappeared.  The  legislation  governing  such  things  had  changed,  and  there  was  a 
panic  about  insurability.  The  playgrounds  were  hastily  removed,  even  though 
they  were  sufficiently  safe,  grandfathered  re  their  insurability,  and  often  paid  for 
(and  quite  recently)  by  parents.  This  meant  no  playgrounds  at  all  for  more  than  a 
year.  During  this  time,  I  often  saw  bored  but  admirable  kids  charging  around  on 
the  roof  of  our  local  school.  It  was  that  or  scrounge  about  in  the  dirt  with  the  cats 
and  the  less  adventurous  children. 

I  say  “sufficiently  safe”  about  the  demolished  playgrounds  because  when 
playgrounds  are  made  too  safe,  kids  either  stop  playing  in  them  or  start  playing 
in  unintended  ways.  Kids  need  playgrounds  dangerous  enough  to  remain 
challenging.  People,  including  children  (who  are  people  too,  after  all)  don’t  seek 
to  minimize  risk.  They  seek  to  optimize  it.  They  drive  and  walk  and  love  and 
play  so  that  they  achieve  what  they  desire,  but  they  push  themselves  a  bit  at  the 
same  time,  too,  so  they  continue  to  develop.  Thus,  if  things  are  made  too  safe, 
people  (including  children)  start  to  figure  out  ways  to  make  them  dangerous 
again. 

When  untrammeled — and  encouraged — we  prefer  to  live  on  the  edge.  There, 
we  can  still  be  both  confident  in  our  experience  and  confronting  the  chaos  that 
helps  us  develop.  We’re  hard-wired,  for  that  reason,  to  enjoy  risk  (some  of  us 
more  than  others).  We  feel  invigorated  and  excited  when  we  work  to  optimize 
our  future  performance,  while  playing  in  the  present.  Otherwise  we  lumber 
around,  sloth-like,  unconscious,  unformed  and  careless.  Overprotected,  we  will 
fail  when  something  dangerous,  unexpected  and  full  of  opportunity  suddenly 
makes  its  appearance,  as  it  inevitably  will. 

The  skatestoppers  are  unattractive.  The  surround  of  the  nearby  sculpture 
would  have  to  have  been  badly  damaged  by  diligent  boardsliders  before  it  would 
look  as  mean  as  it  does  now,  studded  with  metal  like  a  pit  bull’s  collar.  The  large 
plant  boxes  have  metal  guards  placed  at  irregular  intervals  across  their  tops,  and 
this,  in  addition  to  the  wear  caused  by  the  skateboarders,  produces  a  dismal 
impression  of  poor  design,  resentment  and  badly  executed  afterthoughts.  It  gives 


the  area,  which  was  supposed  to  be  beautified  by  the  sculpture  and  vegetation,  a 
generic  industrial/prison/mental  institution/work-camp  look  of  the  kind  that 
appears  when  builders  and  public  officials  do  not  like  or  trust  the  people  they 
serve. 

The  sheer  harsh  ugliness  of  the  solution  makes  a  lie  of  the  reasons  for  its 
implementation. 


Success  and  Resentment 

If  you  read  the  depth  psychologists — Freud  and  Jung,  for  example,  as  well  as 
their  precursor,  Friedrich  Nietzsche — you  learn  that  there  is  a  dark  side  to 
everything.  Freud  delved  deeply  into  the  latent,  implicit  content  of  dreams, 
which  were  often  aimed,  in  his  opinion,  at  the  expression  of  some  improper 
wish.  Jung  believed  that  every  act  of  social  propriety  was  accompanied  by  its 
evil  twin,  its  unconscious  shadow.  Nietzsche  investigated  the  role  played  by 
what  he  termed  ressentiment  in  motivating  what  were  ostensibly  selfless  actions 
— and,  often,  exhibited  all  too  publicly. 

For  that  man  be  delivered  from  revenge — that  is  for  me  the  bridge  to  the  highest  hope,  and  a 
rainbow  after  long  storms.  The  tarantulas,  of  course,  would  have  it  otherwise.  “What  justice 
means  to  us  is  precisely  that  the  world  be  filled  with  the  storms  of  our  revenge” — thus  they 
speak  to  each  other.  “We  shall  wreak  vengeange  and  abuse  on  all  whose  equals  we  are  not” — 
thus  do  the  tarantula-hearts  vow.  “And  ‘will  to  equality’  shall  henceforth  be  the  name  for  virtue; 
and  against  all  that  has  power  we  want  to  raise  our  clamor!”  You  preachers  of  equality,  the 
tyrant-mania  of  impotence  clamors  thus  out  of  you  for  equality:  your  most  secret  ambitions  to 
be  tyrants  thus  shroud  themselves  in  words  of  virtue. 

The  incomparable  English  essayist  George  Orwell  knew  this  sort  of  thing  well. 
In  1937,  he  wrote  The  Road  to  Wigan  Pier,  which  was  in  part  a  scathing  attack 
on  upper-class  British  socialists  (this,  despite  being  inclined  towards  socialism 
himself).  In  the  first  half  of  this  book,  Orwell  portrays  the  appalling  conditions 
faced  by  UK  miners  in  the  1930s: 

Several  dentists  have  told  me  that  in  industrial  districts  a  person  over  thirty  with  any  of  his  or 
her  own  teeth  is  coming  to  be  an  abnormality.  In  Wigan  various  people  gave  me  their  opinion 
that  it  is  best  to  get  shut  of  your  teeth  as  early  in  life  as  possible.  ‘Teeth  is  just  a  misery,’  one 
woman  said  to  me. 

A  Wigan  Pier  coal  miner  had  to  walk — crawl  would  be  a  better  word,  given  the 
height  of  the  mine  shafts — up  to  three  miles,  underground,  in  the  dark,  banging 
his  head  and  scraping  his  back,  just  to  get  to  his  seven-and-a-half-hour  shift  of 
backbreaking  work.  After  that,  he  crawled  back.  “It  is  comparable,  perhaps,  to 
climbing  a  smallish  mountain  before  and  after  your  day’s  work,”  stated  Orwell. 
None  of  the  time  spent  crawling  was  paid. 


Orwell  wrote  The  Road  to  Wigan  Pier  for  the  Left  Book  Club,  a  socialist 
publishing  group  that  released  a  select  volume  every  month.  After  reading  the 
first  half  of  his  book,  which  deals  directly  with  the  miners’  personal 
circumstances,  it  is  impossible  not  to  feel  sympathy  for  the  working  poor.  Only  a 
monster  could  keep  his  heart  hardened  through  the  accounts  of  the  lives  Orwell 
describes: 

It  is  not  long  since  conditions  in  the  mines  were  worse  than  they  are  now.  There  are  still  living  a 
few  very  old  women  who  in  their  youth  have  worked  underground,  crawling  on  all  fours  and 
dragging  tubs  of  coal.  They  used  to  go  on  doing  this  even  when  they  were  pregnant. 

In  book’s  second  half,  however,  Orwell  turned  his  gaze  to  a  different  problem: 
the  comparative  unpopularity  of  socialism  in  the  UK  at  the  time,  despite  the 
clear  and  painful  inequity  observable  everywhere.  He  concluded  that  the  tweed- 
wearing,  armchair-philosophizing,  victim-identifying,  pity-and-contempt- 
dispensing  social-reformer  types  frequently  did  not  like  the  poor,  as  they 
claimed.  Instead,  they  just  hated  the  rich.  They  disguised  their  resentment  and 
jealousy  with  piety,  sanctimony  and  self-righteousness.  Things  in  the 
unconscious — or  on  the  social  justice-dispensing  leftist  front — haven’t  changed 
much,  today.  It  is  because  of  of  Freud,  Jung,  Nietzsche — and  Orwell — that  I 
always  wonder,  “What,  then,  do  you  stand  against?”  whenever  I  hear  someone 
say,  too  loudly,  “I  stand  for  this!”  The  question  seems  particularly  relevant  if  the 
same  someone  is  complaining,  criticizing,  or  trying  to  change  someone  else’s 
behaviour. 

I  believe  it  was  Jung  who  developed  the  most  surgically  wicked  of 
psychoanalytic  dicta:  if  you  cannot  understand  why  someone  did  something,  look 
at  the  consequences — and  infer  the  motivation.  This  is  a  psychological  scalpel. 
It’s  not  always  a  suitable  instrument.  It  can  cut  too  deeply,  or  in  the  wrong 
places.  It  is,  perhaps,  a  last-resort  option.  Nonetheless,  there  are  times  when  its 
application  proves  enlightening. 

If  the  consequences  of  placing  skatestoppers  on  plant-boxes  and  sculpture 
bases,  for  example,  is  unhappy  adolescent  males  and  brutalist  aesthetic  disregard 
of  beauty  then,  perhaps,  that  was  the  aim.  When  someone  claims  to  be  acting 
from  the  highest  principles,  for  the  good  of  others,  there  is  no  reason  to  assume 
that  the  person’s  motives  are  genuine.  People  motivated  to  make  things  better 
usually  aren’t  concerned  with  changing  other  people — or,  if  they  are,  they  take 
responsibility  for  making  the  same  changes  to  themselves  (and  first).  Beneath 
the  production  of  rules  stopping  the  skateboarders  from  doing  highly  skilled, 
courageous  and  dangerous  things  I  see  the  operation  of  an  insidious  and 
profoundly  anti-human  spirit. 


More  about  Chris 

My  friend  Chris,  whom  I  wrote  about  earlier,  was  possessed  by  such  a  spirit — to 
the  serious  detriment  of  his  mental  health.  Part  of  what  plagued  him  was  guilt. 

He  attended  elementary  and  junior  high  school  in  a  number  of  towns,  up  in  the 
frigid  expanses  of  the  northernmost  Alberta  prairie,  prior  to  ending  up  in  the 
Fairview  I  wrote  about  earlier.  Fights  with  Native  kids  were  a  too-common  part 
of  his  experience,  during  those  moves.  It’s  no  overstatement  to  point  out  that 
such  kids  were,  on  average,  rougher  than  the  white  kids,  or  that  they  were 
touchier  (and  they  had  their  reasons).  I  knew  this  well  from  my  own  experience. 

I  had  a  rocky  friendship  with  a  Metis  kid,  Rene  Heck, fnl  when  I  was  in 
elementary  school.  It  was  rocky  because  the  situation  was  complex.  There  was  a 
large  cultural  divide  between  Rene  and  me.  His  clothes  were  dirtier.  He  was 
rougher  in  speech  and  attitude.  I  had  skipped  a  grade  in  school,  and  was,  in 
addition,  small  for  my  age.  Rene  was  a  big,  smart,  good-looking  kid,  and  he  was 
tough.  We  were  in  grade  six  together,  in  a  class  taught  by  my  father.  Rene  was 
caught  chewing  gum.  “Rene,”  said  my  father,  “spit  that  gum  out.  You  look  like  a 
cow.”  “Ha,  ha,”  I  laughed,  under  my  breath.  “Rene  the  cow.”  Rene  might  have 
been  a  cow,  but  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  his  hearing.  “Peterson,”  he  said, 
“after  school — you’re  dead.” 

Earlier  in  the  morning,  Rene  and  I  had  arranged  to  see  a  movie  that  night  at 
the  local  movie  theatre,  the  Gem.  It  looked  like  that  was  off.  In  any  case,  the  rest 
of  the  day  passed,  quickly  and  unpleasantly,  as  it  does  when  threat  and  pain  lurk. 
Rene  was  more  than  capable  of  giving  me  a  good  pounding.  After  school,  I  took 
off  for  the  bike  stands  outside  the  school  as  fast  as  I  could,  but  Rene  beat  me 
there.  We  circled  around  the  bikes,  him  on  one  side,  me  on  the  other.  We  were 
characters  in  a  “Keystone  Cops”  short.  As  long  as  I  kept  circling,  he  couldn’t 
catch  me,  but  my  strategy  couldn’t  work  forever.  I  yelled  out  that  I  was  sorry,  but 
he  wasn’t  mollified.  His  pride  was  hurt,  and  he  wanted  me  to  pay. 

I  crouched  down  and  hid  behind  some  bikes,  keeping  an  eye  on  Rene.  “Rene,” 
I  yelled,  “I’m  sorry  I  called  you  a  cow.  Let’s  quit  fighting.”  He  started  to 
approach  me  again.  I  said,  “Rene,  I  am  sorry  I  said  that.  Really.  And  I  still  want 
to  go  to  the  movie  with  you.”  This  wasn’t  just  a  tactic.  I  meant  it.  Otherwise 
what  happened  next  would  not  have  happened.  Rene  stopped  circling.  Then  he 
stared  at  me.  Then  he  broke  into  tears.  Then  he  ran  off.  That  was  Native-white 
relationships  in  a  nutshell,  in  our  hard  little  town.  We  never  did  go  to  a  movie 
together. 

When  my  friend  Chris  got  into  it  with  Native  kids,  he  wouldn’t  fight  back.  He 
didn’t  feel  that  his  self-defence  was  morally  justified,  so  he  took  his  beatings. 


“We  took  their  land,”  he  later  wrote.  “That  was  wrong.  No  wonder  they’re 
angry.”  Over  time,  step  by  step,  Chris  withdrew  from  the  world.  It  was  partly  his 
guilt.  He  developed  a  deep  hatred  for  masculinity  and  masculine  activity.  He  saw 
going  to  school  or  working  or  finding  a  girlfriend  as  part  of  the  same  process 
that  had  led  to  the  colonization  of  North  America,  the  horrible  nuclear  stalemate 
of  the  cold  war,  and  the  despoiling  of  the  planet.  He  had  read  some  books  about 
Buddhism,  and  felt  that  negation  of  his  own  Being  was  ethically  required,  in  the 
light  of  the  current  world  situation.  He  came  to  believe  that  the  same  applied  to 
others. 

When  I  was  an  undergraduate,  Chris  was,  for  a  while,  one  of  my  roommates. 
One  late  night  we  went  to  a  local  bar.  We  walked  home,  afterward.  He  started  to 
snap  the  side-view  mirrors  off  parked  cars,  one  after  the  other.  I  said,  “Quit  that, 
Chris.  What  possible  good  is  it  going  to  do  to  make  the  people  who  own  these 
cars  miserable?”  He  told  me  that  they  were  all  part  of  the  frenetic  human  activity 
that  was  ruining  everything,  and  that  they  deserved  whatever  they  got.  I  said  that 
taking  revenge  on  people  who  were  just  living  normal  lives  was  not  going  to 
help  anything. 

Years  later,  when  I  was  in  graduate  school  in  Montreal,  Chris  showed  up,  for 
what  was  supposed  to  be  a  visit.  He  was  aimless,  however,  and  lost.  He  asked  if  I 
could  help.  He  ended  up  moving  in.  I  was  married  by  then,  living  with  my  wife, 
Tammy,  and  our  year-old  daughter,  Mikhaila.  Chris  had  also  been  friends  with 
Tammy  back  in  Fairview  (and  held  out  hopes  of  more  than  friendship).  That 
complicated  the  situation  even  more — but  not  precisely  in  the  manner  you  might 
think.  Chris  started  by  hating  men,  but  he  ended  by  hating  women.  He  wanted 
them,  but  he  had  rejected  education,  and  career,  and  desire.  He  smoked  heavily, 
and  was  unemployed.  Unsurprisingly,  therefore,  he  was  not  of  much  interest  to 
women.  That  made  him  bitter.  I  tried  to  convince  him  that  the  path  he  had 
chosen  was  only  going  to  lead  to  further  ruin.  He  needed  to  develop  some 
humility.  He  needed  to  get  a  life. 

One  evening,  it  was  Chris’s  turn  to  make  dinner.  When  my  wife  came  home, 
the  apartment  was  filled  with  smoke.  Hamburgers  were  burning  furiously  in  the 
frying  pan.  Chris  was  on  his  hands  and  knees,  attempting  to  repair  something 
that  had  come  loose  on  the  legs  of  the  stove.  My  wife  knew  his  tricks.  She  knew 
he  was  burning  dinner  on  purpose.  He  resented  having  to  make  it.  He  resented 
the  feminine  role  (even  though  the  household  duties  were  split  in  a  reasonable 
manner;  even  though  he  knew  that  perfectly  well).  He  was  fixing  the  stove  to 
provide  a  plausible,  even  creditable  excuse  for  burning  the  food.  When  she 
pointed  out  what  he  was  doing,  he  played  the  victim,  but  he  was  deeply  and 
dangerously  furious.  Part  of  him,  and  not  the  good  part,  was  convinced  that  he 


was  smarter  than  anyone  else.  It  was  a  blow  to  his  pride  that  she  could  see 
through  his  tricks.  It  was  an  ugly  situation. 

Tammy  and  I  took  a  walk  up  towards  a  local  park  the  next  day.  We  needed  to 
get  away  from  the  apartment,  although  it  was  thirty-five  below — bitterly,  frigidly 
cold,  humid  and  foggy.  It  was  windy.  It  was  hostile  to  life.  Living  with  Chris  was 
too  much,  Tammy  said.  We  entered  the  park.  The  trees  forked  their  bare 
branches  upward  through  the  damp  grey  air.  A  black  squirrel,  tail  hairless  from 
mange,  gripped  a  leafless  branch,  shivered  violently,  struggling  to  hold  on 
against  the  wind.  What  was  it  doing  out  there  in  the  cold?  Squirrels  are  partial 
hibernators.  They  only  come  out  in  the  winter  when  it’s  warm.  Then  we  saw 
another,  and  another,  and  another,  and  another,  and  another.  There  were  squirrels 
all  around  us  in  the  park,  all  partially  hairless,  tails  and  bodies  alike,  all 
windblown  on  their  branches,  all  shaking  and  freezing  in  the  deathly  cold.  No 
one  else  was  around.  It  was  impossible.  It  was  inexplicable.  It  was  exactly 
appropriate.  We  were  on  the  stage  of  an  absurdist  play.  It  was  directed  by  God. 
Tammy  left  soon  after  with  our  daughter  for  a  few  days  elsewhere. 

Near  Christmas  time,  that  same  year,  my  younger  brother  and  his  new  wife 
came  out  to  visit  from  western  Canada.  My  brother  also  knew  Chris.  They  all  put 
on  their  winter  clothes  in  preparation  for  a  walk  around  downtown  Montreal. 
Chris  put  on  a  long  dark  winter  coat.  He  pulled  a  black  toque,  a  brimless  knitted 
cap,  far  down  over  his  head.  His  coat  was  black,  as  were  his  pants  and  boots.  He 
was  very  tall,  and  thin,  and  somewhat  stooped.  “Chris,”  I  joked.  “You  look  like  a 
serial  killer.”  Ha  bloody  ha.  The  three  came  back  from  their  walk.  Chris  was  out 
of  sorts.  There  were  strangers  in  his  territory.  Another  happy  couple.  It  was  salt 
in  his  wounds. 

We  had  dinner,  pleasantly  enough.  We  talked,  and  ended  the  evening.  But  I 
couldn’t  sleep.  Something  wasn’t  right.  It  was  in  the  air.  At  four  in  the  morning, 

I  had  had  enough.  I  crawled  out  of  bed.  I  knocked  quietly  on  Chris’s  door  and 
went  without  waiting  for  an  answer  into  his  room.  He  was  awake  on  the  bed, 
staring  at  the  ceiling,  as  I  knew  he  would  be.  I  sat  down  beside  him.  I  knew  him 
very  well.  I  talked  him  down  from  his  murderous  rage.  Then  I  went  back  to  bed, 
and  slept.  The  next  morning  my  brother  pulled  me  aside.  He  wanted  to  speak 
with  me.  We  sat  down.  He  said,  “What  the  hell  was  going  on  last  night?  I 
couldn’t  sleep  at  all.  Was  something  wrong?”  I  told  my  brother  that  Chris  wasn’t 
doing  so  well.  I  didn’t  tell  him  that  he  was  lucky  to  be  alive — that  we  all  were. 
The  spirit  of  Cain  had  visited  our  house,  but  we  were  left  unscathed. 

Maybe  I  picked  up  some  change  in  scent  that  night,  when  death  hung  in  the 
air.  Chris  had  a  very  bitter  odour.  He  showered  frequently,  but  the  towels  and  the 
sheets  picked  up  the  smell.  It  was  impossible  to  get  them  clean.  It  was  the 


product  of  a  psyche  and  a  body  that  did  not  operate  harmoniously.  A  social 
worker  I  knew,  who  also  knew  Chris,  told  me  of  her  familiarity  with  that  odour. 
Everyone  at  her  workplace  knew  of  it,  although  they  only  discussed  it  in  hushed 
tones.  They  called  it  the  smell  of  the  unemployable. 

Soon  after  this  I  finished  my  post-doctoral  studies.  Tammy  and  I  moved  away 
from  Montreal  to  Boston.  We  had  our  second  baby.  Now  and  then,  Chris  and  I 
talked  on  the  phone.  He  came  to  visit  once.  It  went  well.  He  had  found  a  job  at 
an  auto-parts  place.  He  was  trying  to  make  things  better.  He  was  OK  at  that 
point.  But  it  didn’t  last.  I  didn’t  see  him  in  Boston  again.  Almost  ten  years  later 
— the  night  before  Chris’s  fortieth  birthday,  as  it  happened — he  called  me  again. 
By  this  time,  I  had  moved  my  family  to  Toronto.  He  had  some  news.  A  story  he 
had  written  was  going  to  be  published  in  a  collection  put  together  by  a  small  but 
legitimate  press.  He  wanted  to  tell  me  that.  He  wrote  good  short  stories.  I  had 
read  them  all.  We  had  discussed  them  at  length.  He  was  a  good  photographer, 
too.  He  had  a  good,  creative  eye.  The  next  day,  Chris  drove  his  old  pickup — the 
same  battered  beast  from  Fairview — into  the  bush.  He  ran  a  hose  from  the 
exhaust  pipe  into  the  front  cab.  I  can  see  him  there,  looking  through  the  cracked 
windshield,  smoking,  waiting.  They  found  his  body  a  few  weeks  later.  I  called 
his  dad.  “My  beautiful  boy,”  he  sobbed. 

Recently,  I  was  invited  to  give  a  TEDx  talk  at  a  nearby  university.  Another 
professor  talked  first.  He  had  been  invited  to  speak  because  of  his  work — his 
genuinely  fascinating,  technical  work — with  computationally  intelligent  surfaces 
(like  computer  touchscreens,  but  capable  of  being  placed  everywhere).  He  spoke 
instead  about  the  threat  human  beings  posed  to  the  survival  of  the  planet.  Like 
Chris — like  far  too  many  people — he  had  become  anti-human,  to  the  core.  He 
had  not  walked  as  far  down  that  road  as  my  friend,  but  the  same  dread  spirit 
animated  them  both. 

He  stood  in  front  of  a  screen  displaying  an  endless  slow  pan  of  a  blocks-long 
Chinese  high-tech  factory.  Hundreds  of  white-suited  workers  stood  like  sterile, 
inhuman  robots  behind  their  assembly  lines,  soundlessly  inserting  piece  A  into 
slot  B.  He  told  the  audience — filled  with  bright  young  people — of  the  decision 
he  and  his  wife  had  made  to  limit  their  number  of  children  to  one.  He  told  them 
it  was  something  they  should  all  consider,  if  they  wanted  to  regard  themselves  as 
ethical  people.  I  felt  that  such  a  decision  was  properly  considered — but  only  in 
his  particular  case  (where  less  than  one  might  have  been  even  better).  The  many 
Chinese  students  in  attendance  sat  stolidly  through  his  moralizing.  They  thought, 
perhaps,  of  their  parents’  escape  from  the  horrors  of  Mao’s  Cultural  Revolution 
and  its  one-child  policy.  They  thought,  perhaps,  of  the  vast  improvement  in 


living  standard  and  freedom  provided  by  the  very  same  factories.  A  couple  of 
them  said  as  much  in  the  question  period  that  followed. 

Would  have  the  professor  reconsidered  his  opinions,  if  he  knew  where  such 
ideas  can  lead?  I  would  like  to  say  yes,  but  I  don’t  believe  it.  I  think  he  could 
have  known,  but  refused  to.  Worse,  perhaps:  he  knew,  but  didn’t  care — or  knew, 
and  was  headed  there,  voluntarily,  in  any  case. 

Self-Appointed  Judges  of  the  Human  Race 

It  has  not  been  long  since  the  Earth  seemed  infinitely  larger  than  the  people  who 
inhabited  it.  It  was  only  in  the  late  1800s  that  the  brilliant  biologist  Thomas 
Huxley  (1825-95) — staunch  defender  of  Darwin  and  Aldous  Huxley’s 
grandfather — told  the  British  Parliament  that  it  was  literally  impossible  for 
mankind  to  exhaust  the  oceans.  Their  power  of  generation  was  simply  too  great, 
as  far  as  he  could  determine,  compared  to  even  the  most  assiduous  human 
predations.  It’s  been  an  even  shorter  fifty  years  since  Rachel  Carson’s  Silent 
Spring  ignited  the  environmental  movement.  Fifty  years!  That’s  nothing! 
That’s  not  even  yesterday. 

We’ve  only  just  developed  the  conceptual  tools  and  technologies  that  allow  us 
to  understand  the  web  of  life,  however  imperfectly.  We  deserve  a  bit  of 
sympathy,  in  consequence,  for  the  hypothetical  outrage  of  our  destructive 
behaviour.  Sometimes  we  don’t  know  any  better.  Sometimes  we  do  know  better, 
but  haven’t  yet  formulated  any  practical  alternatives.  It’s  not  as  if  life  is  easy  for 
human  beings,  after  all,  even  now — and  it’s  only  a  few  decades  ago  that  the 
majority  of  human  beings  were  starving,  diseased  and  illiterate.  Wealthy  as 
we  are  (increasingly,  everywhere)  we  still  only  live  decades  that  can  be  counted 
on  our  fingers.  Even  at  present,  it  is  the  rare  and  fortunate  family  that  does  not 
contain  at  least  one  member  with  a  serious  illness — and  all  will  face  that 
problem  eventually.  We  do  what  we  can  to  make  the  best  of  things,  in  our 
vulnerability  and  fragility,  and  the  planet  is  harder  on  us  than  we  are  on  it.  We 
could  cut  ourselves  some  slack. 

Human  beings  are,  after  all,  seriously  remarkable  creatures.  We  have  no  peers, 
and  it’s  not  clear  that  we  have  any  real  limits.  Things  happen  now  that  appeared 
humanly  impossible  even  at  the  same  time  in  the  recent  past  when  we  began  to 
wake  up  to  our  planet-sized  responsibilities.  A  few  weeks  before  writing  this  I 
happened  across  two  videos  juxtaposed  on  YouTube.  One  showed  the  Olympic 
gold  medal  vault  from  1956;  the  other,  the  Olympic  silver  medal  vault  from 
2012.  It  didn’t  even  look  like  the  same  sport — or  the  same  animal.  What 
McKayla  Maroney  did  in  2012  would  have  been  considered  superhuman  in  the 


fifties.  Parkour,  a  sport  derived  from  French  military  obstacle  course  training,  is 
amazing,  as  is  free  running.  I  watch  compilations  of  such  performances  with 
unabashed  admiration.  Some  of  the  kids  jump  off  three-storey  buildings  without 
injury.  It’s  dangerous — and  amazing.  Crane  climbers  are  so  brave  it  rattles  the 
mind.  The  same  goes  for  extreme  mountain  bikers,  freestyle  snowboarders, 
surfers  of  fifty-foot  waves,  and  skateboarders. 

The  boys  who  shot  up  Columbine  High  School,  whom  we  discussed  earlier, 
had  appointed  themselves  judges  of  the  human  race — like  the  TEDx  professor, 
although  much  more  extreme;  like  Chris,  my  doomed  friend.  For  Eric  Harris,  the 
more  literate  of  the  two  killers,  human  beings  were  a  failed  and  corrupt  species. 
Once  a  presupposition  such  as  that  is  accepted,  its  inner  logic  will  inevitably 
manifest  itself.  If  something  is  a  plague,  as  David  Attenborough  has  it,  or  a 
cancer,  as  the  Club  of  Rome  claimed,  the  person  who  eradicates  it  is  a  hero — 

a  veritable  planetary  saviour,  in  this  case.  A  real  messiah  might  follow  through 
with  his  rigorous  moral  logic,  and  eliminate  himself,  as  well.  This  is  what  mass 
murderers,  driven  by  near-infinite  resentment,  typically  do.  Even  their  own 
Being  does  not  justify  the  existence  of  humanity.  In  fact,  they  kill  themselves 
precisely  to  demonstrate  the  purity  of  their  commitment  to  annihilation.  No  one 
in  the  modern  world  may  without  objection  express  the  opinion  that  existence 
would  be  bettered  by  the  absence  of  Jews,  blacks,  Muslims,  or  Englishmen. 

Why,  then,  is  it  virtuous  to  propose  that  the  planet  might  be  better  off,  if  there 
were  fewer  people  on  it?  I  can’t  help  but  see  a  skeletal,  grinning  face,  gleeful  at 
the  possibility  of  the  apocalypse,  hiding  not  so  very  far  behind  such  statements. 
And  why  does  it  so  often  seem  to  be  the  very  people  standing  so  visibly  against 
prejudice  who  so  often  appear  to  feel  obligated  to  denounce  humanity  itself? 

I  have  seen  university  students,  particularly  those  in  the  humanities,  suffer 
genuine  declines  in  their  mental  health  from  being  philosophically  berated  by 
such  defenders  of  the  planet  for  their  existence  as  members  of  the  human 
species.  It’s  worse,  I  think,  for  young  men.  As  privileged  beneficiaries  of  the 
patriarchy,  their  accomplishments  are  considered  unearned.  As  possible 
adherents  of  rape  culture,  they’re  sexually  suspect.  Their  ambitions  make  them 
plunderers  of  the  planet.  They’re  not  welcome.  At  the  junior  high,  high  school 
and  university  level,  they’re  falling  behind  educationally.  When  my  son  was 
fourteen,  we  discussed  his  grades.  He  was  doing  very  well,  he  said,  matter-of- 
factly,  for  a  boy.  I  inquired  further.  Everyone  knew,  he  said,  that  girls  do  better  in 
school  than  boys.  His  intonation  indicated  surprise  at  my  ignorance  of  something 
so  self-evident.  While  writing  this,  I  received  the  latest  edition  of  The 
Economist.  The  cover  story?  “The  Weaker  Sex” — meaning  males.  In  modern 


universities  women  now  make  up  more  than  50  percent  of  the  students  in  more 
than  two-thirds  of  all  disciplines. 

Boys  are  suffering,  in  the  modern  world.  They  are  more  disobedient — 
negatively — or  more  independent — positively — than  girls,  and  they  suffer  for 
this,  throughout  their  pre-university  educational  career.  They  are  less  agreeable 
(agreeableness  being  a  personality  trait  associated  with  compassion,  empathy 
and  avoidance  of  conflict)  and  less  susceptible  to  anxiety  and  depression,  at 
least  after  both  sexes  hit  puberty.  Boys’  interests  tilt  towards  things;  girls’ 
interests  tilt  towards  people.  Strikingly,  these  differences,  strongly  influenced 
by  biological  factors,  are  most  pronounced  in  the  Scandinavian  societies  where 
gender-equality  has  been  pushed  hardest:  this  is  the  opposite  of  what  would  be 
expected  by  those  who  insist,  ever  more  loudly,  that  gender  is  a  social  construct. 
It  isn’t.  This  isn’t  a  debate.  The  data  are  in. 

Boys  like  competition,  and  they  don’t  like  to  obey,  particularly  when  they  are 
adolescents.  During  that  time,  they  are  driven  to  escape  their  families,  and 
establish  their  own  independent  existence.  There  is  little  difference  between 
doing  that  and  challenging  authority.  Schools,  which  were  set  up  in  the  late 
1800s  precisely  to  inculcate  obedience,  do  not  take  kindly  to  provocative  and 
daring  behaviour,  no  matter  how  tough-minded  and  competent  it  might  show  a 
boy  (or  a  girl)  to  be.  Other  factors  play  their  role  in  the  decline  of  boys.  Girls 
will,  for  example,  play  boys’  games,  but  boys  are  much  more  reluctant  to  play 
girls’  games.  This  is  in  part  because  it  is  admirable  for  a  girl  to  win  when 
competing  with  a  boy.  It  is  also  OK  for  her  to  lose  to  a  boy.  For  a  boy  to  beat  a 
girl,  however,  it  is  often  not  OK — and  just  as  often,  it  is  even  less  OK  for  him  to 
lose.  Imagine  that  a  boy  and  a  girl,  aged  nine,  get  into  a  fight.  Just  for  engaging, 
the  boy  is  highly  suspect.  If  he  wins,  he’s  pathetic.  If  he  loses — well,  his  life 
might  as  well  be  over.  Beat  up  by  a  girl. 

Girls  can  win  by  winning  in  their  own  hierarchy — by  being  good  at  what  girls 
value,  as  girls.  They  can  add  to  this  victory  by  winning  in  the  boys’  hierarchy. 
Boys,  however,  can  only  win  by  winning  in  the  male  hierarchy.  They  will  lose 
status,  among  girls  and  boys,  by  being  good  at  what  girls  value.  It  costs  them  in 
reputation  among  the  boys,  and  in  attractiveness  among  the  girls.  Girls  aren’t 
attracted  to  boys  who  are  their  friends,  even  though  they  might  like  them, 
whatever  that  means.  They  are  attracted  to  boys  who  win  status  contests  with 
other  boys.  If  you’re  male,  however,  you  just  can’t  hammer  a  female  as  hard  as 
you  would  a  male.  Boys  can’t  (won’t)  play  truly  competitive  games  with  girls.  It 
isn’t  clear  how  they  can  win.  As  the  game  turns  into  a  girls’  game,  therefore,  the 


boys  leave.  Are  the  universities — particularly  the  humanities — about  to  become 
a  girls’  game?  Is  this  what  we  want? 

The  situation  in  the  universities  (and  in  educational  institutions  in  general)  is 
far  more  problematic  than  the  basic  statistics  indicate.  If  you  eliminate  the  so- 
called  STEM  (science,  technology,  engineering  and  mathematics)  programs 
(excluding  psychology),  the  female/male  ratio  is  even  more  skewed.  Almost 
80  percent  of  students  majoring  in  the  fields  of  healthcare,  public  administration, 
psychology  and  education,  which  comprise  one-quarter  of  all  degrees,  are 
female.  The  disparity  is  still  rapidly  increasing.  At  this  rate,  there  will  be  very 
few  men  in  most  university  disciplines  in  fifteen  years.  This  is  not  good  news  for 
men.  It  might  even  be  catastrophic  news  for  men.  But  it’s  also  not  good  news  for 
women. 

Career  and  Marriage 

The  women  at  female-dominated  institutes  of  higher  education  are  finding  it 
increasingly  difficult  to  arrange  a  dating  relationship  of  even  moderate  duration. 
In  consequence,  they  must  settle,  if  inclined,  for  a  hook-up,  or  sequential  hook¬ 
ups.  Perhaps  this  is  a  move  forward,  in  terms  of  sexual  liberation,  but  I  doubt  it.  I 
think  it’s  terrible  for  the  girls.  A  stable,  loving  relationship  is  highly  desirable, 
for  men  as  well  as  women.  For  women,  however,  it  is  often  what  is  most  wanted. 
From  1997  to  2012,  according  to  the  Pew  Research  Centre,  the  number  of 
women  aged  18  to  34  who  said  that  a  successful  marriage  is  one  of  the  most 
important  things  in  life  rose  from  28  to  37  percent  (an  increase  of  more  than  30 
percent'"2).  The  number  of  young  men  who  said  the  same  thing  declined  15 
percent  over  the  same  period  (from  35  to  29  percent'"3).  During  that  time,  the 
proportion  of  married  people  over  18  continued  to  decline,  down  from  three- 
quarters  in  1960  to  half  now.  Finally,  among  never-married  adults  aged  30  to 
59,  men  are  three  times  as  likely  as  women  to  say  they  do  not  ever  want  to  marry 
(27  vs  8  percent). 

Who  decided,  anyway,  that  career  is  more  important  than  love  and  family?  Is 
working  eighty  hours  a  week  at  a  high-end  law  firm  truly  worth  the  sacrifices 
required  for  that  kind  of  success?  And  if  it  is  worth  it,  why  is  it  worth  it?  A 
minority  of  people  (mostly  men,  who  score  low  in  the  trait  of  agreeableness, 
again)  are  hyper-competitive,  and  want  to  win  at  any  cost.  A  minority  will  find 
the  work  intrinsically  fascinating.  But  most  aren’t,  and  most  won’t,  and  money 
doesn’t  seem  to  improve  people’s  lives,  once  they  have  enough  to  avoid  the  bill 
collectors.  Furthermore,  most  high-performing  and  high-earning  females  have 


high-performing  and  high-earning  partners — and  that  matters  more  to  women. 
The  Pew  data  also  indicate  that  a  spouse  with  a  desirable  job  is  a  high  priority 
for  almost  80  percent  of  never-married  but  marriage-seeking  women  (but  for  less 
than  50  percent  of  men). 

When  they  hit  their  thirties,  most  of  the  top-rate  female  lawyers  bail  out  of 
their  high-pressure  careers.  Only  15  percent  of  equity  partners  at  the  two 
hundred  biggest  US  law  firms  are  women.  This  figure  hasn’t  changed  much  in 
the  last  fifteen  years,  even  though  female  associates  and  staff  attorneys  are 
plentiful.  It  also  isn’t  because  the  law  firms  don’t  want  the  women  to  stay  around 
and  succeed.  There  is  a  chronic  shortage  of  excellent  people,  regardless  of  sex, 
and  law  firms  are  desperate  to  retain  them. 

The  women  who  leave  want  a  job — and  a  life — that  allows  them  some  time. 
After  law  school  and  articling  and  the  few  first  years  of  work,  they  develop  other 
interests.  This  is  common  knowledge  in  the  big  firms  (although  it  is  not 
something  that  people  are  comfortable  articulating  in  public,  men  and  women 
alike).  I  recently  watched  a  McGill  University  professor,  female,  lecture  a  room 
full  of  female  law  partners  or  near-partners  about  how  lack  of  childcare  facilities 
and  “male  definitions  of  success”  impeded  their  career  progress  and  caused 
women  to  leave.  I  knew  most  of  the  women  in  the  room.  We  had  talked  at  great 
length.  I  knew  they  knew  that  none  of  this  was  at  all  the  problem.  They  had 
nannies,  and  they  could  afford  them.  They  had  already  outsourced  all  their 
domestic  obligations  and  necessities.  They  understood,  as  well — and  perfectly 
well — that  it  was  the  market  that  defined  success,  not  the  men  they  worked  with. 
If  you  are  earning  $650  an  hour  in  Toronto  as  a  top  lawyer,  and  your  client  in 
Japan  phones  you  at  4  a.m.  on  a  Sunday,  you  answer.  Now.  You  answer,  now, 
even  if  you  have  just  gone  back  to  sleep  after  feeding  the  baby.  You  answer 
because  some  hyper-ambitious  legal  associate  in  New  York  would  be  happy  to 
answer,  if  you  don’t — and  that’s  why  the  market  defines  the  work. 

The  increasingly  short  supply  of  university-educated  men  poses  a  problem  of 
increasing  severity  for  women  who  want  to  marry,  as  well  as  date.  First,  women 
have  a  strong  proclivity  to  marry  across  or  up  the  economic  dominance 
hierarchy.  They  prefer  a  partner  of  equal  or  greater  status.  This  holds  true  cross- 
culturally.  The  same  does  not  hold,  by  the  way,  for  men,  who  are  perfectly 
willing  to  marry  across  or  down  (as  the  Pew  data  indicate),  although  they  show  a 
preference  for  somewhat  younger  mates.  The  recent  trend  towards  the 
hollowing-out  of  the  middle  class  has  also  been  increasing  as  resource-rich 
women  tend  more  and  more  to  partner  with  resource-rich  men.  Because  of 
this,  and  because  of  the  decline  in  high-paying  manufacturing  jobs  for  men  (one 


of  six  men  of  employable  age  is  currently  without  work  in  the  US),  marriage  is 
now  something  increasingly  reserved  for  the  rich.  I  can’t  help  finding  that 
amusing,  in  a  blackly  ironic  manner.  The  oppressive  patriarchal  institution  of 
marriage  has  now  become  a  luxury.  Why  would  the  rich  tyrannize  themselves? 

Why  do  women  want  an  employed  partner  and,  preferably,  one  of  higher 
status?  In  no  small  part,  it’s  because  women  become  more  vulnerable  when  they 
have  children.  They  need  someone  competent  to  support  mother  and  child  when 
that  becomes  necessary.  It’s  a  perfectly  rational  compensatory  act,  although  it 
may  also  have  a  biological  basis.  Why  would  a  woman  who  decides  to  take 
responsibility  for  one  or  more  infants  want  an  adult  to  look  after  as  well?  So,  the 
unemployed  working  man  is  an  undesirable  specimen — and  single  motherhood 
an  undesirable  alternative.  Children  in  father-absent  homes  are  four  times  as 
likely  to  be  poor.  That  means  their  mothers  are  poor  too.  Fatherless  children  are 
at  much  greater  risk  for  drug  and  alcohol  abuse.  Children  living  with  married 
biological  parents  are  less  anxious,  depressed  and  delinquent  than  children  living 
with  one  or  more  non-biological  parent.  Children  in  single-parent  families  are 
also  twice  as  likely  to  commit  suicide. 

The  strong  turn  towards  political  correctness  in  universities  has  exacerbated 
the  problem.  The  voices  shouting  against  oppression  have  become  louder,  it 
seems,  in  precise  proportion  to  how  equal — even  now  increasingly  skewed 
against  men — the  schools  have  become.  There  are  whole  disciplines  in 
universities  forthrightly  hostile  towards  men.  These  are  the  areas  of  study, 
dominated  by  the  postmodern/neo-Marxist  claim  that  Western  culture,  in 
particular,  is  an  oppressive  structure,  created  by  white  men  to  dominate  and 
exclude  women  (and  other  select  groups);  successful  only  because  of  that 
domination  and  exclusion. 

The  Patriarchy:  Help  or  Hindrance? 

Of  course,  culture  is  an  oppressive  structure.  It’s  always  been  that  way.  It’s  a 
fundamental,  universal  existential  reality.  The  tyrannical  king  is  a  symbolic 
truth;  an  archetypal  constant.  What  we  inherit  from  the  past  is  willfully  blind, 
and  out  of  date.  It’s  a  ghost,  a  machine,  and  a  monster.  It  must  be  rescued, 
repaired  and  kept  at  bay  by  the  attention  and  effort  of  the  living.  It  crushes,  as  it 
hammers  us  into  socially  acceptable  shape,  and  it  wastes  great  potential.  But  it 
offers  great  gain,  too.  Every  word  we  speak  is  a  gift  from  our  ancestors.  Every 
thought  we  think  was  thought  previously  by  someone  smarter.  The  highly 
functional  infrastructure  that  surrounds  us,  particularly  in  the  West,  is  a  gift  from 
our  ancestors:  the  comparatively  uncorrupt  political  and  economic  systems,  the 


technology,  the  wealth,  the  lifespan,  the  freedom,  the  luxury,  and  the  opportunity. 
Culture  takes  with  one  hand,  but  in  some  fortunate  places  it  gives  more  with  the 
other.  To  think  about  culture  only  as  oppressive  is  ignorant  and  ungrateful,  as 
well  as  dangerous.  This  is  not  to  say  (as  I  am  hoping  the  content  of  this  book  has 
made  abundantly  clear,  so  far)  that  culture  should  not  be  subject  to  criticism. 

Consider  this,  as  well,  in  regard  to  oppression:  any  hierarchy  creates  winners 
and  losers.  The  winners  are,  of  course,  more  likely  to  justify  the  hierarchy  and 
the  losers  to  criticize  it.  But  (1)  the  collective  pursuit  of  any  valued  goal 
produces  a  hierarchy  (as  some  will  be  better  and  some  worse  at  that  pursuit  not 
matter  what  it  is)  and  (2)  it  is  the  pursuit  of  goals  that  in  large  part  lends  life  its 
sustaining  meaning.  We  experience  almost  all  the  emotions  that  make  life  deep 
and  engaging  as  a  consequence  of  moving  successfully  towards  something 
deeply  desired  and  valued.  The  price  we  pay  for  that  involvement  is  the 
inevitable  creation  of  hierarchies  of  success,  while  the  inevitable  consequence  is 
difference  in  outcome.  Absolute  equality  would  therefore  require  the  sacrifice  of 
value  itself — and  then  there  would  be  nothing  worth  living  for.  We  might  instead 
note  with  gratitude  that  a  complex,  sophisticated  culture  allows  for  many  games 
and  many  successful  players,  and  that  a  well-structured  culture  allows  the 
individuals  that  compose  it  to  play  and  to  win,  in  many  different  fashions. 

It  is  also  perverse  to  consider  culture  the  creation  of  men.  Culture  is 
symbolically,  archetypally,  mythically  male.  That’s  partly  why  the  idea  of  “the 
patriarchy”  is  so  easily  swallowed.  But  it  is  certainly  the  creation  of  humankind, 
not  the  creation  of  men  (let  alone  white  men,  who  nonetheless  contributed  their 
fair  share).  European  culture  has  only  been  dominant,  to  the  degree  that  it  is 
dominant  at  all,  for  about  four  hundred  years.  On  the  time  scale  of  cultural 
evolution — which  is  to  be  measured,  at  minimum,  in  thousands  of  years — such  a 
timespan  barely  registers.  Furthermore,  even  if  women  contributed  nothing 
substantial  to  art,  literature  and  the  sciences  prior  to  the  1960s  and  the  feminist 
revolution  (which  is  not  something  I  believe),  then  the  role  they  played  raising 
children  and  working  on  the  farms  was  still  instrumental  in  raising  boys  and 
freeing  up  men — a  very  few  men — so  that  humanity  could  propagate  itself  and 
strive  forward. 

Here’s  an  alternative  theory:  throughout  history,  men  and  women  both 
struggled  terribly  for  freedom  from  the  overwhelming  horrors  of  privation  and 
necessity.  Women  were  often  at  a  disadvantage  during  that  struggle,  as  they  had 
all  the  vulnerabilities  of  men,  with  the  extra  reproductive  burden,  and  less 
physical  strength.  In  addition  to  the  filth,  misery,  disease,  starvation,  cruelty  and 
ignorance  that  characterized  the  lives  of  both  sexes,  back  before  the  twentieth 
century  (when  even  people  in  the  Western  world  typically  existed  on  less  than  a 


dollar  a  day  in  today’s  money)  women  also  had  to  put  up  with  the  serious 
practical  inconvenience  of  menstruation,  the  high  probability  of  unwanted 
pregnancy,  the  chance  of  death  or  serious  damage  during  childbirth,  and  the 
burden  of  too  many  young  children.  Perhaps  that  is  sufficient  reason  for  the 
different  legal  and  practical  treatment  of  men  and  women  that  characterized  most 
societies  prior  to  the  recent  technological  revolutions,  including  the  invention  of 
the  birth  control  pill.  At  least  such  things  might  be  taken  into  account,  before  the 
assumption  that  men  tyrannized  women  is  accepted  as  a  truism. 

It  looks  to  me  like  the  so-called  oppression  of  the  patriarchy  was  instead  an 
imperfect  collective  attempt  by  men  and  women,  stretching  over  millennia,  to 
free  each  other  from  privation,  disease  and  drudgery.  The  recent  case  of 
Arunachalam  Muruganantham  provides  a  salutary  example.  This  man,  the 
“tampon  king”  of  India,  became  unhappy  because  his  wife  had  to  use  dirty  rags 
during  her  menstrual  period.  She  told  him  it  was  either  expensive  sanitary 
napkins,  or  milk  for  the  family.  He  spent  the  next  fourteen  years  in  a  state  of 
insanity,  by  his  neighbours’  judgment,  trying  to  rectify  the  problem.  Even  his 
wife  and  his  mother  abandoned  him,  briefly,  terrified  as  they  became  of  his 
obsession.  When  he  ran  out  of  female  volunteers  to  test  his  product,  he  took  to 
wearing  a  bladder  of  pig’s  blood  as  a  replacement.  I  can’t  see  how  this  behaviour 
would  have  improved  his  popularity  or  status.  Now  his  low-cost  and  locally 
made  napkins  are  distributed  across  India,  manufactured  by  women-run  self-help 
groups.  His  users  have  been  provided  with  freedom  they  never  previously 
experienced.  In  2014,  this  high-school  dropout  was  named  one  of  Time 
magazine’s  100  most  influential  people  in  the  world.  I  am  unwilling  to  consider 
personal  gain  Muruganantham’s  primary  motivation.  Is  he  part  of  the  patriarchy? 

In  1847,  James  Young  Simpson  used  ether  to  help  a  woman  who  had  a 
deformed  pelvis  give  birth.  Afterwards,  he  switched  to  the  better-performing 
chloroform.  The  first  baby  delivered  under  its  influence  was  named 
“Anaesthesia.”  By  1853,  chloroform  was  esteemed  enough  to  be  used  by  Queen 
Victoria,  who  delivered  her  seventh  baby  under  its  influence.  Remarkably  soon 
afterward,  the  option  of  painless  childbirth  was  available  everywhere.  A  few 
people  warned  of  the  danger  of  opposing  God’s  pronouncement  to  women  in 
Genesis  3:16:  “I  will  greatly  multiply  thy  sorrow  and  thy  conception;  in  sorrow 
thou  shalt  bring  forth  children  ...”  Some  also  opposed  its  use  among  males: 
young,  healthy,  courageous  men  simply  did  not  need  anaesthesia.  Such 
opposition  was  ineffectual.  Use  of  anaesthesia  spread  with  extreme  rapidity  (and 
far  faster  than  would  be  possible  today).  Even  prominent  churchmen  supported 
its  use. 


The  first  practical  tampon,  Tampax,  didn’t  arrive  until  the  1930s.  It  was 
invented  by  Dr.  Earle  Cleveland  Haas.  He  made  it  of  compressed  cotton,  and 
designed  an  applicator  from  paper  tubes.  This  helped  lessen  resistance  to  the 
products  by  those  who  objected  to  the  self-touching  that  might  otherwise  occur. 
By  the  early  1940s,  25  percent  of  women  were  using  them.  Thirty  years  later,  it 
was  70  percent.  Now  it’s  four  out  of  five,  with  the  remainder  relying  on  pads, 
which  are  now  hyper-absorbent,  and  held  in  place  by  effective  adhesives 
(opposed  to  the  awkwardly  placed,  bulky,  belted,  diaper-like  sanitary  napkins  of 
the  1970s).  Did  Muruganantham,  Simpson  and  Haas  oppress  women,  or  free 
them?  What  about  Gregory  Goodwin  Pincus,  who  invented  the  birth  control  pill? 
In  what  manner  were  these  practical,  enlightened,  persistent  men  part  of  a 
constricting  patriarchy? 

Why  do  we  teach  our  young  people  that  our  incredible  culture  is  the  result  of 
male  oppression?  Blinded  by  this  central  assumption  disciplines  as  diverse  as 
education,  social  work,  art  history,  gender  studies,  literature,  sociology  and, 
increasingly,  law  actively  treat  men  as  oppressors  and  men’s  activity  as 
inherently  destructive.  They  also  often  directly  promote  radical  political  action — 
radical  by  all  the  norms  of  the  societies  within  which  they  are  situated — which 
they  do  not  distinguish  from  education.  The  Pauline  Jewett  Institute  of  Women’s 
and  Gender  Studies  at  Ottawa’s  Carleton  University,  for  example,  encourages 
activism  as  part  of  their  mandate.  The  Gender  Studies  Department  at  Queen’s 
University  in  Kingston,  Ontario,  “teaches  feminist,  anti-racist,  and  queer  theories 
and  methods  that  centre  activism  for  social  change” — indicating  support  for  the 
supposition  that  university  education  should  above  all  foster  political 
engagement  of  a  particular  kind. 

Postmodernism  and  the  Long  Arm  of  Marx 

These  disciplines  draw  their  philosophy  from  multiple  sources.  All  are  heavily 
influenced  by  the  Marxist  humanists.  One  such  figure  is  Max  Horkheimer,  who 
developed  critical  theory  in  the  1930s.  Any  brief  summary  of  his  ideas  is  bound 
to  be  oversimplified,  but  Horkheimer  regarded  himself  as  a  Marxist.  He  believed 
that  Western  principles  of  individual  freedom  or  the  free  market  were  merely 
masks  that  served  to  disguise  the  true  conditions  of  the  West:  inequality, 
domination  and  exploitation.  He  believed  that  intellectual  activity  should  be 
devoted  to  social  change,  instead  of  mere  understanding,  and  hoped  to 
emancipate  humanity  from  its  enslavement.  Horkheimer  and  his  Frankfurt 
School  of  associated  thinkers — first,  in  Germany  and  later,  in  the  US — aimed  at 
a  full-scale  critique  and  transformation  of  Western  civilization. 


More  important  in  recent  years  has  been  the  work  of  French  philosopher 
Jacques  Derrida,  leader  of  the  postmodernists,  who  came  into  vogue  in  the  late 
1970s.  Derrida  described  his  own  ideas  as  a  radicalized  form  of  Marxism.  Marx 
attempted  to  reduce  history  and  society  to  economics,  considering  culture  the 
oppression  of  the  poor  by  the  rich.  When  Marxism  was  put  into  practice  in  the 
Soviet  Union,  China,  Vietnam,  Cambodia  and  elsewhere,  economic  resources 
were  brutally  redistributed.  Private  property  was  eliminated,  and  rural  people 
forcibly  collectivized.  The  result?  Tens  of  millions  of  people  died.  Hundreds  of 
millions  more  were  subject  to  oppression  rivalling  that  still  operative  in  North 
Korea,  the  last  classic  communist  holdout.  The  resulting  economic  systems  were 
corrupt  and  unsustainable.  The  world  entered  a  prolonged  and  extremely 
dangerous  cold  war.  The  citizens  of  those  societies  lived  the  life  of  the  lie, 
betraying  their  families,  informing  on  their  neighbours — existing  in  misery, 
without  complaint  (or  else). 

Marxist  ideas  were  very  attractive  to  intellectual  Utopians.  One  of  the  primary 
architects  of  the  horrors  of  the  Khmer  Rouge,  Khieu  Samphan,  received  a 
doctorate  at  the  Sorbonne  before  he  became  the  nominal  head  of  Cambodia  in 
the  mid-1970s.  In  his  doctoral  thesis,  written  in  1959,  he  argued  that  the  work 
done  by  non-farmers  in  Cambodia’s  cities  was  unproductive:  bankers, 
bureaucrats  and  businessmen  added  nothing  to  society.  Instead,  they  parasitized 
the  genuine  value  produced  through  agriculture,  small  industry  and  craft. 
Samphan’s  ideas  were  favourably  looked  upon  by  the  French  intellectuals  who 
granted  him  his  Ph.D.  Back  in  Cambodia,  he  was  provided  with  the  opportunity 
to  put  his  theories  into  practice.  The  Khmer  Rouge  evacuated  Cambodia’s  cities, 
drove  all  the  inhabitants  into  the  countryside,  closed  the  banks,  banned  the  use  of 
currency,  and  destroyed  all  the  markets.  A  quarter  of  the  Cambodian  population 
were  worked  to  death  in  the  countryside,  in  the  killing  fields. 

Lest  We  Forget:  Ideas  Have  Consequences. 

When  the  communists  established  the  Soviet  Union  after  the  First  World  War, 
people  could  be  forgiven  for  hoping  that  the  utopian  collectivist  dreams  their 
new  leaders  purveyed  were  possible.  The  decayed  social  order  of  the  late 
nineteenth  century  produced  the  trenches  and  mass  slaughters  of  the  Great  War. 
The  gap  between  rich  and  poor  was  extreme,  and  most  people  slaved  away  in 
conditions  worse  than  those  later  described  by  Orwell.  Although  the  West 
received  word  of  the  horror  perpetrated  by  Lenin  after  the  Russian  Revolution,  it 
remained  difficult  to  evaluate  his  actions  from  afar.  Russia  was  in  post- 
monarchical  chaos,  and  the  news  of  widespread  industrial  development  and 


redistribution  of  property  to  those  who  had  so  recently  been  serfs  provided 
reason  for  hope.  To  complicate  things  further,  the  USSR  (and  Mexico)  supported 
the  democratic  Republicans  when  the  Spanish  Civil  War  broke  out,  in  1936. 

They  were  fighting  against  the  essentially  fascist  Nationalists,  who  had 
overthrown  the  fragile  democracy  established  only  five  years  previously,  and 
who  found  support  with  the  Nazis  and  Italian  fascists. 

The  intelligentsia  in  America,  Great  Britain  and  elsewhere  were  severely 
frustrated  by  their  home  countries’  neutrality.  Thousands  of  foreigners  streamed 
into  Spain  to  fight  for  the  Republicans,  serving  in  the  International  Brigades. 
George  Orwell  was  one  of  them.  Ernest  Hemingway  served  there  as  a  journalist, 
and  was  a  supporter  of  the  Republicans.  Politically  concerned  young  Americans, 
Canadians  and  Brits  felt  a  moral  obligation  to  stop  talking  and  start  fighting. 

All  of  this  drew  attention  away  from  concurrent  events  in  the  Soviet  Union.  In 
the  1930s,  during  the  Great  Depression,  the  Stalinist  Soviets  sent  two  million 
kulaks,  their  richest  peasants,  to  Siberia  (those  with  a  small  number  of  cows,  a 
couple  of  hired  hands,  or  a  few  acres  more  than  was  typical).  From  the 
communist  viewpoint,  these  kulaks  had  gathered  their  wealth  by  plundering 
those  around  them,  and  deserved  their  fate.  Wealth  signified  oppression,  and 
private  property  was  theft.  It  was  time  for  some  equity.  More  than  thirty 
thousand  kulaks  were  shot  on  the  spot.  Many  more  met  their  fate  at  the  hands  of 
their  most  jealous,  resentful  and  unproductive  neighbours,  who  used  the  high 
ideals  of  communist  collectivization  to  mask  their  murderous  intent. 

The  kulaks  were  “enemies  of  the  people,”  apes,  scum,  vermin,  filth  and  swine. 
“We  will  make  soap  out  of  the  kulak,”  claimed  one  particularly  brutal  cadre  of 
city-dwellers,  mobilized  by  party  and  Soviet  executive  committees,  and  sent  out 
into  the  countryside.  The  kulaks  were  driven,  naked,  into  the  streets,  beaten,  and 
forced  to  dig  their  own  graves.  The  women  were  raped.  Their  belongings  were 
“expropriated,”  which,  in  practice,  meant  that  their  houses  were  stripped  down  to 
the  rafters  and  ceiling  beams  and  everything  was  stolen.  In  many  places,  the 
non-kulak  peasants  resisted,  particularly  the  women,  who  took  to  surrounding 
the  persecuted  families  with  their  bodies.  Such  resistance  proved  futile.  The 
kulaks  who  didn’t  die  were  exiled  to  Siberia,  often  in  the  middle  of  the  night. 

The  trains  started  in  February,  in  the  bitter  Russian  cold.  Housing  of  the  most 
substandard  kind  awaited  them  upon  arrival  on  the  desert  taiga.  Many  died, 
particularly  children,  from  typhoid,  measles  and  scarlet  fever. 

The  “parasitical”  kulaks  were,  in  general,  the  most  skillful  and  hardworking 
farmers.  A  small  minority  of  people  are  responsible  for  most  of  the  production  in 
any  field,  and  farming  proved  no  different.  Agricultural  output  crashed.  What 
little  remained  was  taken  by  force  out  of  the  countryside  and  into  the  cities. 


Rural  people  who  went  out  into  the  fields  after  the  harvest  to  glean  single  grains 
of  wheat  for  their  hungry  families  risked  execution.  Six  million  people  died  of 
starvation  in  the  Ukraine,  the  breadbasket  of  the  Soviet  Union,  in  the  1930s.  “To 
eat  your  own  children  is  a  barbarian  act,”  declared  posters  of  the  Soviet  regime. 

Despite  more  than  mere  rumours  of  such  atrocities,  attitudes  towards 
communism  remained  consistently  positive  among  many  Western  intellectuals. 
There  were  other  things  to  worry  about,  and  the  Second  World  War  allied  the 
Soviet  Union  with  the  Western  countries  opposing  Hitler,  Mussolini  and 
Hirohito.  Certain  watchful  eyes  remained  open,  nonetheless.  Malcolm 
Muggeridge  published  a  series  of  articles  describing  Soviet  demolition  of  the 
peasantry  as  early  as  1933,  for  the  Manchester  Guardian.  George  Orwell 
understood  what  was  going  on  under  Stalin,  and  he  made  it  widely  known.  He 
published  An imal  Farm,  a  fable  satirizing  the  Soviet  Union,  in  1945,  despite 
encountering  serious  resistance  to  the  book’s  release.  Many  who  should  have 
known  better  retained  their  blindness  for  long  after  this.  Nowhere  was  this  truer 
than  France,  and  nowhere  truer  in  France  than  among  the  intellectuals. 

France’s  most  famous  mid-century  philosopher,  Jean-Paul  Sartre,  was  a  well- 
known  communist,  although  not  a  card-carrier,  until  he  denounced  the  Soviet 
incursion  into  Hungary  in  1956.  He  remained  an  advocate  for  Marxism, 
nonetheless,  and  did  not  finally  break  with  the  Soviet  Union  until  1968,  when 
the  Soviets  violently  suppressed  the  Czechoslovakians  during  the  Prague  Spring. 

Not  long  after  came  the  publication  of  Aleksandr  Solzhenitsyn’s  The  Gulag 
Archipelago,  which  we  have  discussed  rather  extensively  in  previous  chapters. 
As  noted  (and  is  worth  noting  again),  this  book  utterly  demolished  communism’s 
moral  credibility — first  in  the  West,  and  then  in  the  Soviet  System  itself.  It 
circulated  in  underground  samizdat  format.  Russians  had  twenty-four  hours  to 
read  their  rare  copy  before  handing  it  to  the  next  waiting  mind.  A  Russian- 
language  reading  was  broadcast  into  the  Soviet  Union  by  Radio  Liberty. 

Solzhenitsyn  argued  that  the  Soviet  system  could  have  never  survived  without 
tyranny  and  slave  labour;  that  the  seeds  of  its  worst  excesses  were  definitively 
sowed  in  the  time  of  Lenin  (for  whom  the  Western  communists  still  served  as 
apologists);  and  that  it  was  propped  up  by  endless  lies,  both  individual  and 
public.  Its  sins  could  not  be  blamed  on  a  simple  cult  of  personality,  as  its 
supporters  continued  to  claim.  Solzhenitsyn  documented  the  Soviet  Union’s 
extensive  mistreatment  of  political  prisoners,  its  corrupt  legal  system,  and  its 
mass  murders,  and  showed  in  painstaking  detail  how  these  were  not  aberrations 
but  direct  expressions  of  the  underlying  communist  philosophy.  No  one  could 
stand  up  for  communism  after  The  Gulag  Archipelago — not  even  the 
communists  themselves. 


This  did  not  mean  that  the  fascination  Marxist  ideas  had  for  intellectuals — 
particularly  French  intellectuals — disappeared.  It  merely  transformed.  Some 
refused  outright  to  learn.  Sartre  denounced  Solzhenitsyn  as  a  “dangerous 
element.”  Derrida,  more  subtle,  substituted  the  idea  of  power  for  the  idea  of 
money,  and  continued  on  his  merry  way.  Such  linguistic  sleight-of-hand  gave  all 
the  barely  repentant  Marxists  still  inhabiting  the  intellectual  pinnacles  of  the 
West  the  means  to  retain  their  world-view.  Society  was  no  longer  repression  of 
the  poor  by  the  rich.  It  was  oppression  of  everyone  by  the  powerful. 

According  to  Derrida,  hierarchical  structures  emerged  only  to  include  (the 
beneficiaries  of  that  structure)  and  to  exclude  (everyone  else,  who  were  therefore 
oppressed).  Even  that  claim  wasn’t  sufficiently  radical.  Derrida  claimed  that 
divisiveness  and  oppression  were  built  right  into  language — built  into  the  very 
categories  we  use  to  pragmatically  simplify  and  negotiate  the  world.  There  are 
“women”  only  because  men  gain  by  excluding  them.  There  are  “males  and 
females”  only  because  members  of  that  more  heterogeneous  group  benefit  by 
excluding  the  tiny  minority  of  people  whose  biological  sexuality  is  amorphous. 
Science  only  benefits  the  scientists.  Politics  only  benefits  the  politicians.  In 
Derrida’s  view,  hierarchies  exist  because  they  gain  from  oppressing  those  who 
are  omitted.  It  is  this  ill-gotten  gain  that  allows  them  to  flourish. 

Derrida  famously  said  (although  he  denied  it,  later):  “II  n’y  a  pas  de  hors- 
texte” — often  translated  as  “there  is  nothing  outside  the  text.”  His  supporters  say 
that  is  a  mistranslation,  and  that  the  English  equivalent  should  have  been  “there 
is  no  outside-text.”  It  remains  difficult,  either  way,  to  read  the  statement  as 
saying  anything  other  than  “everything  is  interpretation,”  and  that  is  how 
Derrida’s  work  has  generally  been  interpreted. 

It  is  almost  impossible  to  over-estimate  the  nihilistic  and  destructive  nature  of 
this  philosophy.  It  puts  the  act  of  categorization  itself  in  doubt.  It  negates  the 
idea  that  distinctions  might  be  drawn  between  things  for  any  reasons  other  than 
that  of  raw  power.  Biological  distinctions  between  men  and  women?  Despite  the 
existence  of  an  overwhelming,  multi-disciplinary  scientific  literature  indicating 
that  sex  differences  are  powerfully  influenced  by  biological  factors,  science  is 
just  another  game  of  power,  for  Derrida  and  his  post-modern  Marxist  acolytes, 
making  claims  to  benefit  those  at  the  pinnacle  of  the  scientific  world.  There  are 
no  facts.  Hierarchical  position  and  reputation  as  a  consequence  of  skill  and 
competence?  All  definitions  of  skill  and  of  competence  are  merely  made  up  by 
those  who  benefit  from  them,  to  exclude  others,  and  to  benefit  personally  and 
selfishly. 

There  is  sufficient  truth  to  Derrida’s  claims  to  account,  in  part,  for  their 
insidious  nature.  Power  is  a  fundamental  motivational  force  (“a,”  not  “the”). 


People  compete  to  rise  to  the  top,  and  they  care  where  they  are  in  dominance 
hierarchies.  But  (and  this  is  where  you  separate  the  metaphorical  boys  from  the 
men,  philosophically)  the  fact  that  power  plays  a  role  in  human  motivation  does 
not  mean  that  it  plays  the  only  role,  or  even  the  primary  role.  Likewise,  the  fact 
that  we  can  never  know  everything  does  make  all  our  observations  and 
utterances  dependent  on  taking  some  things  into  account  and  leaving  other 
things  out  (as  we  discussed  extensively  in  Rule  10).  That  does  not  justify  the 
claim  that  everything  is  interpretation,  or  that  categorization  is  just  exclusion. 
Beware  of  single  cause  interpretations — and  beware  the  people  who  purvey 
them. 

Although  the  facts  cannot  speak  for  themselves  (just  as  an  expanse  of  land 
spread  out  before  a  voyager  cannot  tell  him  how  to  journey  through  it),  and 
although  there  are  a  myriad  ways  to  interact  with — even  to  perceive — even  a 
small  number  of  objects,  that  does  not  mean  that  all  interpretations  are  equally 
valid.  Some  hurt — yourself  and  others.  Others  put  you  on  a  collision  course  with 
society.  Some  are  not  sustainable  across  time.  Others  do  not  get  you  where  you 
want  to  go.  Many  of  these  constraints  are  built  in  to  us,  as  a  consequence  of 
billions  of  years  of  evolutionary  processes.  Others  emerge  as  we  are  socialized 
into  cooperating  and  competing  peacefully  and  productively  with  others.  Still 
more  interpretations  emerge  as  we  discard  counterproductive  strategies  through 
learning.  An  endless  number  of  interpretations,  certainly:  that  is  not  different 
than  saying  an  endless  number  of  problems.  But  a  seriously  bounded  number  of 
viable  solutions.  Otherwise  life  would  be  easy.  And  it’s  not. 

Now,  I  have  some  beliefs  that  might  be  regarded  as  left-leaning.  I  think,  for 
example,  that  the  tendency  for  valuable  goods  to  distribute  themselves  with 
pronounced  inequality  constitutes  an  ever-present  threat  to  the  stability  of 
society.  I  think  there  is  good  evidence  for  that.  That  does  not  mean  that  the 
solution  to  the  problem  is  self-evident.  We  don’t  know  how  to  redistribute 
wealth  without  introducing  a  whole  host  of  other  problems.  Different  Western 
societies  have  tried  different  approaches.  The  Swedes,  for  example,  push 
equality  to  its  limit.  The  US  takes  the  opposite  tack,  assuming  that  the  net 
wealth-creation  of  a  more  free-for-all  capitalism  constitutes  the  rising  tide  that 
lifts  all  boats.  The  results  of  these  experiments  are  not  all  in,  and  countries  differ 
very  much  in  relevant  ways.  Differences  in  history,  geographic  area,  population 
size  and  ethnic  diversity  make  direct  comparisons  very  difficult.  But  it  certainly 
is  the  case  that  forced  redistribution,  in  the  name  of  utopian  equality,  is  a  cure  to 
shame  the  disease. 

I  think,  as  well  (on  what  might  be  considered  the  leftish  side),  that  the 
incremental  remake  of  university  administrations  into  analogues  of  private 


corporations  is  a  mistake.  I  think  that  the  science  of  management  is  a  pseudo- 
discipline.  I  believe  that  government  can,  sometimes,  be  a  force  for  good,  as  well 
as  the  necessary  arbiter  of  a  small  set  of  necessary  rules.  Nonetheless,  I  do  not 
understand  why  our  society  is  providing  public  funding  to  institutions  and 
educators  whose  stated,  conscious  and  explicit  aim  is  the  demolition  of  the 
culture  that  supports  them.  Such  people  have  a  perfect  right  to  their  opinions  and 
actions,  if  they  remain  lawful.  But  they  have  no  reasonable  claim  to  public 
funding.  If  radical  right-wingers  were  receiving  state  funding  for  political 
operations  disguised  as  university  courses,  as  the  radical  left-wingers  clearly  are, 
the  uproar  from  progressives  across  North  America  would  be  deafening. 

There  are  other  serious  problems  lurking  in  the  radical  disciplines,  apart  from 
the  falseness  of  their  theories  and  methods,  and  their  insistence  that  collective 
political  activism  is  morally  obligatory.  There  isn’t  a  shred  of  hard  evidence  to 
support  any  of  their  central  claims:  that  Western  society  is  pathologically 
patriarchal;  that  the  prime  lesson  of  history  is  that  men,  rather  than  nature,  were 
the  primary  source  of  the  oppression  of  women  (rather  than,  as  in  most  cases, 
their  partners  and  supporters);  that  all  hierarchies  are  based  on  power  and  aimed 
at  exclusion.  Hierarchies  exist  for  many  reasons — some  arguably  valid,  some  not 
— and  are  incredibly  ancient,  evolutionarily  speaking.  Do  male  crustaceans 
oppress  female  crustaceans?  Should  their  hierarchies  be  upended? 

In  societies  that  are  well-functioning — not  in  comparison  to  a  hypothetical 
utopia,  but  contrasted  with  other  existing  or  historical  cultures — competence,  not 
power,  is  a  prime  determiner  of  status.  Competence.  Ability.  Skill.  Not  power. 
This  is  obvious  both  anecdotally  and  factually.  No  one  with  brain  cancer  is 
equity-minded  enough  to  refuse  the  service  of  the  surgeon  with  the  best 
education,  the  best  reputation  and,  perhaps,  the  highest  earnings.  Furthermore, 
the  most  valid  personality  trait  predictors  of  long-term  success  in  Western 
countries  are  intelligence  (as  measured  with  cognitive  ability  or  IQ  tests)  and 
conscientiousness  (a  trait  characterized  by  industriousness  and  orderliness). 

There  are  exceptions.  Entrepreneurs  and  artists  are  higher  in  openness  to 
experience,  another  cardinal  personality  trait,  than  in  conscientiousness.  But 
openness  is  associated  with  verbal  intelligence  and  creativity,  so  that  exception  is 
appropriate  and  understandable.  The  predictive  power  of  these  traits, 
mathematically  and  economically  speaking,  is  exceptionally  high — among  the 
highest,  in  terms  of  power,  of  anything  ever  actually  measured  at  the  harder  ends 
of  the  social  sciences.  A  good  battery  of  personality/cognitive  tests  can  increase 
the  probability  of  employing  someone  more  competent  than  average  from  50:50 
to  85:15.  These  are  the  facts,  as  well  supported  as  anything  in  the  social  sciences 


(and  this  is  saying  more  than  you  might  think,  as  the  social  sciences  are  more 
effective  disciplines  than  their  cynical  critics  appreciate).  Thus,  not  only  is  the 
state  supporting  one-sided  radicalism,  it  is  also  supporting  indoctrination.  We  do 
not  teach  our  children  that  the  world  is  flat.  Neither  should  we  teach  them 
unsupported  ideologically-predicated  theories  about  the  nature  of  men  and 
women — or  the  nature  of  hierarchy. 

It  is  not  unreasonable  to  note  (if  the  deconstructionists  would  leave  it  at  that) 
that  science  can  be  biased  by  the  interests  of  power,  and  to  warn  against  that — or 
to  point  out  that  evidence  is  too  often  what  powerful  people,  including  scientists, 
decide  it  is.  After  all,  scientists  are  people  too,  and  people  like  power,  just  like 
lobsters  like  power — just  like  deconstructionists  like  to  be  known  for  their  ideas, 
and  strive  rightly  to  sit  atop  their  academic  hierarchies.  But  that  doesn’t  mean 
that  science — or  even  deconstructionism — is  only  about  power.  Why  believe 
such  a  thing?  Why  insist  upon  it?  Perhaps  it’s  this:  if  only  power  exists,  then  the 
use  of  power  becomes  fully  justifiable.  There  is  no  bounding  such  use  by 
evidence,  method,  logic,  or  even  the  necessity  for  coherence.  There  is  no 
bounding  by  anything  “outside  the  text.”  That  leaves  opinion — and  force — and 
the  use  of  force  is  all  too  attractive,  under  such  circumstances,  just  as  its 
employment  in  the  service  of  that  opinion  is  all  too  certain.  The  insane  and 
incomprehensible  postmodern  insistence  that  all  gender  differences  are  socially 
constructed,  for  example,  becomes  all  too  understandable  when  its  moral 
imperative  is  grasped — when  its  justification  for  force  is  once  and  for  all 
understood:  Society  must  be  altered,  or  bias  eliminated,  until  all  outcomes  are 
equitable.  But  the  bedrock  of  the  social  constructionist  position  is  the  wish  for 
the  latter,  not  belief  in  the  justice  of  the  former.  Since  all  outcome  inequalities 
must  be  eliminated  (inequality  being  the  heart  of  all  evil),  then  all  gender 
differences  must  be  regarded  as  socially  constructed.  Otherwise  the  drive  for 
equality  would  be  too  radical,  and  the  doctrine  too  blatantly  propagandistic. 
Thus,  the  order  of  logic  is  reversed,  so  that  the  ideology  can  be  camouflaged. 

The  fact  that  such  statements  lead  immediately  to  internal  inconsistencies  within 
the  ideology  is  never  addressed.  Gender  is  constructed,  but  an  individual  who 
desires  gender  re-assignment  surgery  is  to  be  unarguably  considered  a  man 
trapped  in  a  woman’s  body  (or  vice  versa).  The  fact  that  both  of  these  cannot 
logically  be  true,  simultaneously,  is  just  ignored  (or  rationalized  away  with 
another  appalling  post-modern  claim:  that  logic  itself — along  with  the 
techniques  of  science — is  merely  part  of  the  oppressive  patriarchal  system). 

It  is  also  the  case,  of  course,  that  all  outcomes  cannot  be  equalized.  First, 
outcomes  must  be  measured.  Comparing  the  salaries  of  people  who  occupy  the 
same  position  is  relatively  straightforward  (although  complicated  significantly 


by  such  things  as  date  of  hire,  given  the  difference  in  demand  for  workers,  for 
example,  at  different  time  periods).  But  there  are  other  dimensions  of 
comparison  that  are  arguably  equally  relevant,  such  as  tenure,  promotion  rate, 
and  social  influence.  The  introduction  of  the  “equal  pay  for  equal  work” 
argument  immediately  complicates  even  salary  comparison  beyond  practicality, 
for  one  simple  reason:  who  decides  what  work  is  equal?  It’s  not  possible.  That’s 
why  the  marketplace  exists.  Worse  is  the  problem  of  group  comparison:  women 
should  make  as  much  as  men.  OK.  Black  women  should  make  as  much  as  white 
women.  OK.  Should  salary  then  be  adjusted  for  all  parameters  of  race?  At  what 
level  of  resolution?  What  racial  categories  are  “real”? 

The  U.S.  National  Institute  of  Health,  to  take  a  single  bureaucratic  example, 
recognizes  American  Indian  or  Alaska  Native,  Asian,  Black,  Hispanic,  Native 
Hawaiian  or  other  Pacific  Islander,  and  White.  But  there  are  more  than  five 
hundred  separate  American  Indian  tribes.  By  what  possible  logic  should 
“American  Indian”  therefore  stand  as  a  canonical  category?  Osage  tribal 
members  have  a  yearly  average  income  of  $30K,  while  Tohono  O’odham’s  make 
$11K.  Are  they  equally  oppressed?  What  about  disabilities?  Disabled  people 
should  make  as  much  as  non-disabled  people.  OK.  On  the  surface,  that’s  a  noble, 
compassionate,  fair  claim.  But  who  is  disabled?  Is  someone  living  with  a  parent 
with  Alzheimer’s  disabled?  If  not,  why  not?  What  about  someone  with  a  lower 
IQ?  Someone  less  attractive?  Someone  overweight?  Some  people  clearly  move 
through  life  markedly  overburdened  with  problems  that  are  beyond  their  control, 
but  it  is  a  rare  person  indeed  who  isn’t  suffering  from  at  least  one  serious 
catastrophe  at  any  given  time — particularly  if  you  include  their  family  in  the 
equation.  And  why  shouldn’t  you?  Here’s  the  fundamental  problem:  group 
identity  can  be  fractionated  right  down  to  the  level  of  the  individual.  That 
sentence  should  be  written  in  capital  letters.  Every  person  is  unique — and  not 
just  in  a  trivial  manner:  importantly,  significantly,  meaningfully  unique.  Group 
membership  cannot  capture  that  variability.  Period. 

None  of  this  complexity  is  ever  discussed  by  the  postmodern/Marxist  thinkers. 
Instead,  their  ideological  approach  fixes  a  point  of  truth,  like  the  North  Star,  and 
forces  everything  to  rotate  around  it.  The  claim  that  all  gender  differences  are  a 
consequence  of  socialization  is  neither  provable,  nor  disprovable,  in  some  sense, 
because  culture  can  be  brought  to  bear  with  such  force  on  groups  or  individuals 
that  virtually  any  outcome  is  attainable,  if  we  are  willing  to  bear  the  cost.  We 
know,  for  example,  from  studies  of  adopted-out  identical  twins,  that  culture 
can  produce  a  fifteen-point  (or  one  standard  deviation)  increase  in  IQ  (roughly 
the  difference  between  the  average  high  school  student  and  the  average  state 


college  student)  at  the  cost  of  a  three-standard-deviation  increase  in  wealth. 

What  this  means,  approximately,  is  that  two  identical  twins,  separated  at  birth, 
will  differ  in  IQ  by  fifteen  points  if  the  first  twin  is  raised  in  a  family  that  is 
poorer  than  85  percent  of  families  and  the  second  is  raised  in  a  family  richer  than 
95  percent  of  families.  Something  similar  has  recently  been  demonstrated  with 
education,  rather  than  wealth.  We  don’t  know  what  it  would  cost  in  wealth  or 
differential  education  to  produce  a  more  extreme  transformation. 

What  such  studies  imply  is  that  we  could  probably  minimize  the  innate 
differences  between  boys  and  girls,  if  we  were  willing  to  exert  enough  pressure. 
This  would  in  no  way  ensure  that  we  were  freeing  people  of  either  gender  to 
make  their  own  choices.  But  choice  has  no  place  in  the  ideological  picture:  if 
men  and  women  act,  voluntarily,  to  produce  gender-unequal  outcomes,  those 
very  choices  must  have  been  determined  by  cultural  bias.  In  consequence, 
everyone  is  a  brainwashed  victim,  wherever  gender  differences  exist,  and  the 
rigorous  critical  theoretician  is  morally  obligated  to  set  them  straight.  This 
means  that  those  already  equity-minded  Scandinavian  males,  who  aren’t  much 
into  nursing,  require  even  more  retraining.  The  same  goes,  in  principle,  for 
Scandinavian  females,  who  aren’t  much  into  engineering.  What  might  such 
retraining  look  like?  Where  might  its  limits  lie?  Such  things  are  often  pushed 
past  any  reasonable  limit  before  they  are  discontinued.  Mao’s  murderous 
Cultural  Revolution  should  have  taught  us  that. 

Boys  into  Girls 

It  has  become  a  tenet  of  a  certain  kind  of  social  constructionist  theory  that  the 
world  would  be  much  improved  if  boys  were  socialized  like  girls.  Those  who  put 
forward  such  theories  assume,  first,  that  aggression  is  a  learned  behaviour,  and 
can  therefore  simply  not  be  taught,  and  second  (to  take  a  particular  example) 
that,  “boys  should  be  socialized  the  way  girls  have  been  traditionally  socialized, 
and  they  should  be  encouraged  to  develop  socially  positive  qualities  such  as 
tenderness,  sensitivity  to  feelings,  nurturance,  cooperative  and  aesthetic 
appreciation.”  In  the  opinions  of  such  thinkers,  aggression  will  only  be  reduced 
when  male  adolescents  and  young  adults  “subscribe  to  the  same  standards  of 
behavior  as  have  been  traditionally  encouraged  for  women.” 

There  are  so  many  things  wrong  with  this  idea  that  it  is  difficult  to  know 
where  to  start.  First,  it  is  not  the  case  that  aggression  is  merely  learned. 
Aggression  is  there  at  the  beginning.  There  are  ancient  biological  circuits,  so  to 
speak,  that  underlie  defensive  and  predatory  aggression.  They  are  so 


fundamental  that  they  still  operate  in  what  are  known  as  decorticate  cats,  animals 
that  have  had  the  largest  and  most  recently  evolved  parts  of  their  brain — an 
overwhelmingly  large  percentage  of  the  total  structure — entirely  removed.  This 
suggests  not  only  that  aggression  is  innate,  but  that  it  is  a  consequence  of  activity 
in  extremely  fundamental,  basic  brain  areas.  If  the  brain  is  a  tree,  then  aggression 
(along  with  hunger,  thirst  and  sexual  desire)  is  there  in  the  very  trunk. 

And,  in  keeping  with  this,  it  appears  that  a  subset  of  two-year-old  boys  (about 
5  percent)  are  quite  aggressive,  by  temperament.  They  take  other  kids’  toys, 
kick,  bite  and  hit.  Most  are  nonetheless  socialized  effectively  by  the  age  of 
four.  This  is  not,  however,  because  they  have  been  encouraged  to  act  like  little 
girls.  Instead,  they  are  taught  or  otherwise  learn  in  early  childhood  to  integrate 
their  aggressive  tendencies  into  more  sophisticated  behavioural  routines. 
Aggression  underlies  the  drive  to  be  outstanding,  to  be  unstoppable,  to  compete, 
to  win — to  be  actively  virtuous,  at  least  along  one  dimension.  Determination  is 
its  admirable,  pro-social  face.  Aggressive  young  children  who  don’t  manage  to 
render  their  temperament  sophisticated  by  the  end  of  infancy  are  doomed  to 
unpopularity,  as  their  primordial  antagonism  no  longer  serves  them  socially  at 
later  ages.  Rejected  by  their  peers,  they  lack  further  socialization  opportunities 
and  tend  towards  outcast  status.  These  are  the  individuals  who  remain  much 
more  inclined  toward  antisocial  and  criminal  behavior  when  adolescent  and 
adult.  But  this  does  not  at  all  mean  that  the  aggressive  drive  lacks  either  utility  or 
value.  At  a  minimum,  it  is  necessary  for  self-protection. 

Compassion  as  a  Vice 

Many  of  the  female  clients  (perhaps  even  a  majority)  that  I  see  in  my  clinical 
practice  have  trouble  in  their  jobs  and  family  lives  not  because  they  are  too 
aggressive,  but  because  they  are  not  aggressive  enough.  Cognitive-behavioural 
therapists  call  the  treatment  of  such  people,  generally  characterized  by  the  more 
feminine  traits  of  agreeableness  (politeness  and  compassion)  and  neuroticism 
(anxiety  and  emotional  pain),  “assertiveness  training.”  Insufficiently 
aggressive  women — and  men,  although  more  rarely — do  too  much  for  others. 
They  tend  to  treat  those  around  them  as  if  they  were  distressed  children.  They 
tend  to  be  naive.  They  assume  that  cooperation  should  be  the  basis  of  all  social 
transactions,  and  they  avoid  conflict  (which  means  they  avoid  confronting 
problems  in  their  relationships  as  well  as  at  work).  They  continually  sacrifice  for 
others.  This  may  sound  virtuous — and  it  is  definitely  an  attitude  that  has  certain 
social  advantages — but  it  can  and  often  does  become  counterproductively  one¬ 
sided.  Because  too-agreeable  people  bend  over  backwards  for  other  people,  they 


do  not  stand  up  properly  for  themselves.  Assuming  that  others  think  as  they  do, 
they  expect — instead  of  ensuring — reciprocity  for  their  thoughtful  actions.  When 
this  does  not  happen,  they  don’t  speak  up.  They  do  not  or  cannot 
straightforwardly  demand  recognition.  The  dark  side  of  their  characters  emerges, 
because  of  their  subjugation,  and  they  become  resentful. 

I  teach  excessively  agreeable  people  to  note  the  emergence  of  such 
resentment,  which  is  a  very  important,  although  very  toxic,  emotion.  There  are 
only  two  major  reasons  for  resentment:  being  taken  advantage  of  (or  allowing 
yourself  to  be  taken  advantage  of),  or  whiny  refusal  to  adopt  responsibility  and 
grow  up.  If  you’re  resentful,  look  for  the  reasons.  Perhaps  discuss  the  issue  with 
someone  you  trust.  Are  you  feeling  hard  done  by,  in  an  immature  manner?  If, 
after  some  honest  consideration,  you  don’t  think  it’s  that,  perhaps  someone  is 
taking  advantage  of  you.  This  means  that  you  now  face  a  moral  obligation  to 
speak  up  for  yourself.  This  might  mean  confronting  your  boss,  or  your  husband, 
or  your  wife,  or  your  child,  or  your  parents.  It  might  mean  gathering  some 
evidence,  strategically,  so  that  when  you  confront  that  person,  you  can  give  them 
several  examples  of  their  misbehaviour  (at  least  three),  so  they  can’t  easily 
weasel  out  of  your  accusations.  It  might  mean  failing  to  concede  when  they  offer 
you  their  counterarguments.  People  rarely  have  more  than  four  at  hand.  If  you 
remain  unmoved,  they  get  angry,  or  cry,  or  run  away.  It’s  very  useful  to  attend  to 
tears  in  such  situations.  They  can  be  used  to  motivate  guilt  on  the  part  of  the 
accuser  due,  theoretically,  to  having  caused  hurt  feelings  and  pain.  But  tears  are 
often  shed  in  anger.  A  red  face  is  a  good  cue.  If  you  can  push  your  point  past  the 
first  four  responses  and  stand  fast  against  the  consequent  emotion,  you  will  gain 
your  target’s  attention — and,  perhaps,  their  respect.  This  is  genuine  conflict, 
however,  and  it’s  neither  pleasant  nor  easy. 

You  must  also  know  clearly  what  you  want  out  of  the  situation,  and  be 
prepared  to  clearly  articulate  your  desire.  It’s  a  good  idea  to  tell  the  person  you 
are  confronting  exactly  what  you  would  like  them  to  do  instead  of  what  they 
have  done  or  currently  are  doing.  You  might  think,  “if  they  loved  me,  they  would 
know  what  to  do.”  That’s  the  voice  of  resentment.  Assume  ignorance  before 
malevolence.  No  one  has  a  direct  pipeline  to  your  wants  and  needs — not  even 
you.  If  you  try  to  determine  exactly  what  you  want,  you  might  find  that  it  is 
more  difficult  than  you  think.  The  person  oppressing  you  is  likely  no  wiser  than 
you,  especially  about  you.  Tell  them  directly  what  would  be  preferable,  instead, 
after  you  have  sorted  it  out.  Make  your  request  as  small  and  reasonable  as 
possible — but  ensure  that  its  fulfillment  would  satisfy  you.  In  that  manner,  you 
come  to  the  discussion  with  a  solution,  instead  of  just  a  problem. 


Agreeable,  compassionate,  empathic,  conflict-averse  people  (all  those  traits 
group  together)  let  people  walk  on  them,  and  they  get  bitter.  They  sacrifice 
themselves  for  others,  sometimes  excessively,  and  cannot  comprehend  why  that 
is  not  reciprocated.  Agreeable  people  are  compliant,  and  this  robs  them  of  their 
independence.  The  danger  associated  with  this  can  be  amplified  by  high  trait 
neuroticism.  Agreeable  people  will  go  along  with  whoever  makes  a  suggestion, 
instead  of  insisting,  at  least  sometimes,  on  their  own  way.  So,  they  lose  their 
way,  and  become  indecisive  and  too  easily  swayed.  If  they  are,  in  addition,  easily 
frightened  and  hurt,  they  have  even  less  reason  to  strike  out  on  their  own,  as 
doing  so  exposes  them  to  threat  and  danger  (at  least  in  the  short  term).  That’s  the 
pathway  to  dependent  personality  disorder,  technically  speaking.  It  might  be 
regarded  as  the  polar  opposite  of  antisocial  personality  disorder,  the  set  of  traits 
characteristic  of  delinquency  in  childhood  and  adolescence  and  criminality  in 
adulthood.  It  would  be  lovely  if  the  opposite  of  a  criminal  was  a  saint — but  it’s 
not  the  case.  The  opposite  of  a  criminal  is  an  Oedipal  mother,  which  is  its  own 
type  of  criminal. 

The  Oedipal  mother  (and  fathers  can  play  this  role  too,  but  it’s  comparatively 
rare)  says  to  her  child,  “I  only  live  for  you.”  She  does  everything  for  her 
children.  She  ties  their  shoes,  and  cuts  up  their  food,  and  lets  them  crawl  into  bed 
with  her  and  her  partner  far  too  often.  That’s  a  good  and  conflict-avoidant 
method  for  avoiding  unwanted  sexual  attention,  as  well. 

The  Oedipal  mother  makes  a  pact  with  herself,  her  children,  and  the  devil 
himself.  The  deal  is  this:  “Above  all,  never  leave  me.  In  return,  I  will  do 
everything  for  you.  As  you  age  without  maturing,  you  will  become  worthless 
and  bitter,  but  you  will  never  have  to  take  any  responsibility,  and  everything  you 
do  that’s  wrong  will  always  be  someone  else’s  fault.”  The  children  can  accept  or 
reject  this — and  they  have  some  choice  in  the  matter. 

The  Oedipal  mother  is  the  witch  in  the  story  of  Hansel  and  Gretel.  The  two 
children  in  that  fairy  tale  have  a  new  step-mother.  She  orders  her  husband  to 
abandon  his  children  in  the  forest,  as  there  is  a  famine  and  she  thinks  they  eat  too 
much.  He  obeys  his  wife,  takes  his  children  deep  into  the  woods  and  leaves  them 
to  their  fate.  Wandering,  starving  and  lonely,  they  come  across  a  miracle.  A 
house.  And  not  just  any  house.  A  candy  house.  A  gingerbread  house.  A  person 
who  had  not  been  rendered  too  caring,  empathic,  sympathetic  and  cooperative 
might  be  skeptical,  and  ask,  “Is  this  too  good  to  be  true?”  But  the  children  are 
too  young,  and  too  desperate. 

Inside  the  house  is  a  kind  old  woman,  rescuer  of  distraught  children,  kind 
patter  of  heads  and  wiper  of  noses,  all  bosom  and  hips,  ready  to  sacrifice  herself 
to  their  every  wish,  at  a  moment’s  notice.  She  feeds  the  children  anything  they 


want,  any  time  they  want,  and  they  never  have  to  do  anything.  But  provision  of 
that  kind  of  care  makes  her  hungry.  She  puts  Hansel  into  a  cage,  to  fatten  him  up 
ever  more  efficiently.  He  fools  her  into  thinking  he’s  staying  thin  by  offering  her 
an  old  bone,  when  she  tries  to  test  his  leg  for  the  desired  tenderness.  She  gets  too 
desperate  to  wait,  eventually,  and  stokes  the  oven,  preparing  to  cook  and  eat  the 
object  of  her  doting.  Gretel,  who  has  apparently  not  been  lulled  into  full 
submission,  waits  for  a  moment  of  carelessness,  and  pushes  the  kind  old  woman 
into  the  oven.  The  kids  run  away,  and  rejoin  their  father,  who  has  thoroughly 
repented  of  his  evil  actions. 

In  a  household  like  that,  the  choicest  cut  of  child  is  the  spirit,  and  it’s  always 
consumed  first.  Too  much  protection  devastates  the  developing  soul. 

The  witch  in  the  Hansel  and  Gretel  tale  is  the  Terrible  Mother,  the  dark  half  of 
the  symbolically  feminine.  Deeply  social  as  we  are  in  our  essence,  we  tend  to 
view  the  world  as  a  story,  the  characters  of  which  are  mother,  father  and  child. 
The  feminine,  as  a  whole,  is  unknown  nature  outside  the  bounds  of  culture, 
creation  and  destruction:  she  is  the  protective  arms  of  mother  and  the  destructive 
element  of  time,  the  beautiful  virgin-mother  and  the  swamp-dwelling  hag.  This 
archetypal  entity  was  confused  with  an  objective,  historical  reality,  back  in  the 
late  1800s,  by  a  Swiss  anthropologist  named  Johann  Jakob  Bachofen.  Bachofen 
proposed  that  humanity  had  passed  through  a  series  of  developmental  stages  in 
its  history. 

The  first,  roughly  speaking  (after  a  somewhat  anarchic  and  chaotic 
beginning),  was  Das  Mutterrecht  — a  society  where  women  held  the  dominant 
positions  of  power,  respect  and  honour,  where  polyamory  and  promiscuity  ruled, 
and  where  any  certainty  of  paternity  was  absent.  The  second,  the  Dionysian,  was 
a  phase  of  transition,  during  which  these  original  matriarchal  foundations  were 
overturned  and  power  was  taken  by  men.  The  third  phase,  the  Apollonian,  still 
reigns  today.  The  patriarchy  rules,  and  each  woman  belongs  exclusively  to  one 
man.  Bachofen’s  ideas  became  profoundly  influential,  in  certain  circles,  despite 
the  absence  of  any  historical  evidence  to  support  them.  One  Marija  Gimbutas, 
for  example — an  archaeologist — famously  claimed  in  the  1980s  and  1990s  that  a 
peaceful  goddess-and-woman-centred  culture  once  characterized  Neolithic 
Europe.  She  claimed  that  it  was  supplanted  and  suppressed  by  an  invasive 
hierarchical  warrior  culture,  which  laid  the  basis  for  modern  society.  Art 
historian  Merlin  Stone  made  the  same  argument  in  his  book  When  God  Was  a 
Woman.  This  whole  series  of  essentially  archetypal/mythological  ideas 
became  touchstones  for  the  theology  of  the  women’s  movement  and  the 
matriarchal  studies  of  1970s  feminism  (Cynthia  Eller,  who  wrote  a  book 


criticizing  such  ideas — The  Myth  of  Matriarchal  Prehistory — called  this 
theology  “an  ennobling  lie”). 

Carl  Jung  had  encountered  Bachofen’s  ideas  of  primordial  matriarchy  decades 
earlier.  Jung  soon  realized,  however,  that  the  developmental  progression 
described  by  the  earlier  Swiss  thinker  represented  a  psychological  rather  than  a 
historical  reality.  He  saw  in  Bachofen’s  thought  the  same  processes  of  projection 
of  imaginative  fantasy  on  to  the  external  world  that  had  led  to  the  population  of 
the  cosmos  with  constellations  and  gods.  In  The  Origins  and  History  of 
Consciousness  and  The  Great  Mother—  ,  Jung’s  collaborator  Erich  Neumann 
extended  his  colleague’s  analysis.  Neumann  traced  the  emergence  of 
consciousness,  symbolically  masculine,  and  contrasted  it  with  its  symbolically 
feminine,  material  (mother,  matrix)  origins,  subsuming  Freud’s  theory  of 
Oedipal  parenting  into  a  broader  archetypal  model.  For  Neumann,  and  for  Jung, 
consciousness — always  symbolically  masculine,  even  in  women — struggles 
upwards  toward  the  light.  Its  development  is  painful  and  anxiety-provoking,  as  it 
carries  with  it  the  realization  of  vulnerability  and  death.  It  is  constantly  tempted 
to  sink  back  down  into  dependency  and  unconsciousness,  and  to  shed  its 
existential  burden.  It  is  aided  in  that  pathological  desire  by  anything  that  opposes 
enlightenment,  articulation,  rationality,  self-determination,  strength  and 
competence — by  anything  that  shelters  too  much,  and  therefore  smothers  and 
devours.  Such  overprotection  is  Freud’s  Oedipal  familial  nightmare,  which  we 
are  rapidly  transforming  into  social  policy. 

The  Terrible  Mother  is  an  ancient  symbol.  It  manifests  itself,  for  example,  in 
the  form  of  Tiamat,  in  the  earliest  written  story  we  have  recovered,  the 
Mesopotamian  Enuma  Elish.  Tiamat  is  the  mother  of  all  things,  gods  and  men 
alike.  She  is  the  unknown  and  chaos  and  the  nature  that  gives  rise  to  all  forms. 
But  she  is  also  the  female  dragon-deity  who  moves  to  destroy  her  own  children, 
when  they  carelessly  kill  their  father  and  attempt  to  live  on  the  corpse  that 
remains.  The  Terrible  Mother  is  the  spirit  of  careless  unconsciousness,  tempting 
the  ever-striving  spirit  of  awareness  and  enlightenment  down  into  the  protective 
womb-like  embrace  of  the  underworld.  It’s  the  terror  young  men  feel  towards 
attractive  women,  who  are  nature  itself,  ever  ready  to  reject  them,  intimately,  at 
the  deepest  possible  level.  Nothing  inspires  self-consciousness,  undermines 
courage,  and  fosters  feelings  of  nihilism  and  hatred  more  than  that — except, 
perhaps,  the  too-tight  embrace  of  too-caring  mom. 

The  Terrible  Mother  appears  in  many  fairy  tales,  and  in  many  stories  for 
adults.  In  the  Sleeping  Beauty,  she  is  the  Evil  Queen,  dark  nature  herself — 
Maleficent,  in  the  Disney  version.  The  royal  parents  of  Princess  Aurora  fail  to 


invite  this  force  of  the  night  to  their  baby  daughter’s  christening.  Thus,  they 
shelter  her  too  much  from  the  destructive  and  dangerous  side  of  reality, 
preferring  that  she  grow  up  untroubled  by  such  things.  Their  reward?  At  puberty, 
she  is  still  unconscious.  The  masculine  spirit,  her  prince,  is  both  a  man  who 
could  save  her,  by  tearing  her  from  her  parents,  and  her  own  consciousness, 
trapped  in  a  dungeon  by  the  machinations  of  the  dark  side  of  femininity.  When 
that  prince  escapes,  and  presses  the  Evil  Queen  too  hard,  she  turns  into  the 
Dragon  of  Chaos  itself.  The  symbolic  masculine  defeats  her  with  truth  and  faith, 
and  finds  the  princess,  whose  eyes  he  opens  with  a  kiss. 

It  might  be  objected  (as  it  was,  with  Disney’s  more  recent  and  deeply 
propagandistic  Frozen )  that  a  woman  does  not  need  a  man  to  rescue  her.  That 
may  be  true,  and  it  may  not.  It  may  be  that  only  the  woman  who  wants  (or  has)  a 
child  needs  a  man  to  rescue  her — or  at  least  to  support  and  aid  her.  In  any  case,  it 
is  certain  that  a  woman  needs  consciousness  be  rescued,  and,  as  noted  above, 
consciousness  is  symbolically  masculine  and  has  been  since  the  beginning  of 
time  (in  the  guise  both  of  order  and  of  the  Logos,  the  mediating  principle).  The 
Prince  could  be  a  lover,  but  could  also  be  a  woman’s  own  attentive  wakefulness, 
clarity  of  vision,  and  tough-minded  independence.  Those  are  masculine  traits — 
in  actuality,  as  well  as  symbolically,  as  men  are  actually  less  tender-minded  and 
agreeable  than  women,  on  average,  and  are  less  susceptible  to  anxiety  and 
emotional  pain.  And,  to  say  it  again:  (1)  this  is  most  true  in  those  Scandinavian 
nations  where  the  most  steps  towards  gender  equality  have  been  taken — and  (2) 
the  differences  are  not  small  by  the  standards  whereby  such  things  are  measured. 

The  relationship  between  the  masculine  and  consciousness  is  also  portrayed, 
symbolically,  in  the  Disney  movie  The  Little  Mermaid.  Ariel,  the  heroine,  is 
quite  feminine,  but  she  also  has  a  strong  spirit  of  independence.  For  this  reason, 
she  is  her  father’s  favourite,  although  she  also  causes  him  the  most  trouble.  Her 
father  Triton  is  the  king,  representing  the  known,  culture  and  order  (with  a  hint 
of  the  oppressive  rule-giver  and  tyrant).  Because  order  is  always  opposed  by 
chaos,  Triton  has  an  adversary,  Ursula,  a  tentacled  octopus — a  serpent,  a  gorgon, 
a  hydra.  Thus,  Ursula  is  in  the  same  archetypal  category  as  the  dragon/queen 
Maleficent  in  Sleeping  Beauty  (or  the  jealous  older  queen  in  Snow  White,  Lady 
Tremaine  in  Cinderella,  the  Red  Queen  in  Alice  in  Wonderland,  Cruella  de  Vil  in 
101  Dalmations,  Miss  Medusa  in  The  Rescuers  and  Mother  Gothel  in  Tangled). 

Ariel  wants  to  kindle  a  romance  with  Prince  Eric,  whom  she  previously 
rescued  from  a  shipwreck.  Ursula  tricks  Ariel  into  giving  up  her  voice  so  that 
she  can  have  three  days  as  a  human  being.  Ursula  knows  full  well,  however,  that 
a  voiceless  Ariel  will  not  be  able  to  establish  a  relationship  with  the  Prince. 


Without  her  capacity  to  speak — without  the  Logos;  without  the  Divine  Word — 
she  will  remain  underwater,  unconscious,  forever. 

When  Ariel  fails  to  form  a  union  with  Prince  Eric,  Ursula  steals  her  soul,  and 
places  it  in  her  large  collection  of  shrivelled  and  warped  semi-beings,  well- 
protected  by  her  feminine  graces.  When  King  Triton  shows  up  to  demand  the 
return  of  his  daughter,  Ursula  makes  him  a  terrible  offer:  he  can  take  Ariel’s 
place.  Of  course,  the  elimination  of  the  Wise  King  (who  represents,  to  say  it 
again,  the  benevolent  side  of  the  patriarchy)  has  been  Ursula’s  nefarious  plan  all 
along.  Ariel  is  released,  but  Triton  is  now  reduced  to  a  pathetic  shadow  of  his 
former  self.  More  importantly,  Ursula  now  has  Triton’s  magic  trident,  the  source 
of  his  godlike  power. 

Fortunately  for  everyone  concerned  (except  Ursula),  Prince  Eric  returns, 
distracting  the  evil  queen  of  the  underworld  with  a  harpoon.  This  opens  an 
opportunity  for  Ariel  to  attack  Ursula,  who  grows,  in  response,  to  monstrous 
proportions — in  the  same  manner  as  Maleficent,  Sleeping  Beauty’s  evil  queen. 
Ursula  creates  a  huge  storm,  and  raises  a  whole  navy  of  sunken  ships  from  the 
ocean  floor.  As  she  prepares  to  kill  Ariel,  Eric  commandeers  a  wrecked  ship,  and 
rams  her  with  its  broken  bowsprit.  Triton  and  the  other  captured  souls  are 
released.  The  rejuvenated  Triton  then  transforms  his  daughter  into  a  human 
being,  so  she  can  remain  with  Eric.  For  a  woman  to  become  complete,  such 
stories  claim,  she  must  form  a  relationship  with  masculine  consciousness  and 
stand  up  to  the  terrible  world  (which  sometimes  manifests  itself,  primarily,  in  the 
form  of  her  too-present  mother).  An  actual  man  can  help  her  do  that,  to  some 
degree,  but  it  is  better  for  everyone  concerned  when  no  one  is  too  dependent. 

One  day,  when  I  was  a  kid,  I  was  out  playing  softball  with  some  friends.  The 
teams  were  a  mixture  of  boys  and  girls.  We  were  all  old  enough  so  that  the  boys 
and  girls  were  starting  to  be  interested  in  one  another  in  an  unfamiliar  way. 

Status  was  becoming  more  relevant  and  important.  My  friend  Jake  and  I  were 
about  to  come  to  blows,  pushing  each  other  around  near  the  pitching  mound, 
when  my  mom  walked  by.  She  was  a  fair  distance  away,  about  thirty  yards,  but  I 
could  immediately  see  by  the  change  in  her  body  language  that  she  knew  what 
was  going  on.  Of  course,  the  other  kids  saw  her  as  well.  She  walked  right  by.  I 
knew  that  hurt  her.  Part  of  her  was  worried  that  I  would  come  home  with  a 
bloody  nose  and  a  black  eye.  It  would  have  been  easy  enough  for  her  just  to  yell, 
“Hey,  you  kids,  quit  that!”  or  even  to  come  over  and  interfere.  But  she  didn’t.  A 
few  years  later,  when  I  was  having  teenage  trouble  with  my  dad,  my  mom  said, 
“If  it  was  too  good  at  home,  you’d  never  leave.” 

My  mom  is  a  tender-hearted  person.  She’s  empathetic,  and  cooperative,  and 
agreeable.  Sometimes  she  lets  people  push  her  around.  When  she  went  back  to 


work  after  being  at  home  with  her  young  kids,  she  found  it  challenging  to  stand 
up  to  the  men.  Sometimes  that  made  her  resentful — something  she  also  feels, 
sometimes,  in  relationship  to  my  father,  who  is  strongly  inclined  to  do  what  he 
wants,  when  he  wants  to.  Despite  all  that,  she’s  no  Oedipal  mother.  She  fostered 
the  independence  of  her  children,  even  though  doing  so  was  often  hard  on  her. 
She  did  the  right  thing,  even  though  it  caused  her  emotional  distress. 

Toughen  Up,  You  Weasel 

I  spent  one  youthful  summer  on  the  prairie  of  central  Saskatchewan  working  on 
a  railway  line  crew.  Every  man  in  that  all-male  group  was  tested  by  the  others 
during  the  first  two  weeks  or  so  of  their  hiring.  Many  of  the  other  workers  were 
Northern  Cree  Indians,  quiet  guys  for  the  most  part,  easygoing,  until  they  drank 
too  much,  and  the  chips  on  their  shoulders  started  to  show.  They  had  been  in  and 
out  of  jail,  as  had  most  of  their  relatives.  They  didn’t  attach  much  shame  to  that, 
considering  it  just  another  part  of  the  white  man’s  system.  It  was  also  warm  in 
jail  in  the  winter,  and  the  food  was  regular  and  plentiful.  I  lent  one  of  the  Cree 
guys  fifty  bucks  at  one  point.  Instead  of  paying  me  back,  he  offered  me  a  pair  of 
bookends,  cut  from  some  of  the  original  rail  laid  across  western  Canada,  which  I 
still  own.  That  was  better  than  the  fifty  bucks. 

When  a  new  guy  first  showed  up,  the  other  workers  would  inevitably  provide 
him  with  an  insulting  nickname.  They  called  me  Howdy-Doody,  after  I  was 
accepted  as  a  crew  member  (something  I  am  still  slightly  embarrassed  to  admit). 
When  I  asked  the  originator  why  he  chose  that  moniker,  he  said,  wittily  and 
absurdly,  “Because  you  look  nothing  like  him.”  Working  men  are  often 
extremely  funny,  in  a  caustic,  biting,  insulting  manner  (as  discussed  in  Rule  9). 
They  are  always  harassing  each  other,  partly  for  amusement,  partly  to  score 
points  in  the  eternal  dominance  battle  between  them,  but  also  partly  to  see  what 
the  other  guy  will  do  if  he  is  subjected  to  social  stress.  It’s  part  of  the  process  of 
character  evaluation,  as  well  as  camaraderie.  When  it  works  well  (when 
everybody  gets,  and  gives  as  good  as  they  get,  and  can  give  and  take)  it’s  a  big 
part  of  what  allows  men  who  work  for  a  living  to  tolerate  or  even  enjoy  laying 
pipe  and  working  on  oil  rigs  and  lumberjacking  and  working  in  restaurant 
kitchens  and  all  the  other  hot,  dirty,  physically  demanding  and  dangerous  work 
that  is  still  done  almost  totally  by  men. 

Not  too  long  after  I  started  on  the  rail  crew,  my  name  was  changed  to  Howdy. 
This  was  a  great  improvement,  as  it  had  a  good  Western  connotation,  and  was 
not  obviously  linked  to  that  stupid  puppet.  The  next  man  hired  was  not  so 
fortunate.  He  carried  a  fancy  lunchbucket,  which  was  a  mistake,  as  brown  paper 


bags  were  the  proper,  non-pretentious  convention.  It  was  a  little  too  nice  and  too 
new.  It  looked  like  maybe  his  mother  had  bought  it  (and  packed  it)  for  him. 

Thus,  it  became  his  name.  Lunchbucket  was  not  a  good-humored  guy.  He 
bitched  about  everything,  and  had  a  bad  attitude.  Everything  was  someone  else’s 
fault.  He  was  touchy,  and  none  too  quick  on  the  draw. 

Lunchbucket  couldn’t  accept  his  name,  or  settle  into  his  job.  He  adopted  an 
attitude  of  condescending  irritation  when  addressed,  and  reacted  to  the  work  in 
the  same  manner.  He  was  not  fun  to  be  around,  and  he  couldn’t  take  a  joke. 
That’s  fatal,  on  a  work  crew.  After  about  three  days  of  carrying  on  with  his  ill- 
humour  and  general  air  of  hard-done-by  superiority,  Lunchbucket  started  to 
experience  harassment  extending  well  beyond  his  nickname.  He  would  be 
peevishly  working  away  on  the  line,  surrounded  by  about  seventy  men,  spread 
out  over  a  quarter  mile.  Suddenly  a  pebble  would  appear  out  of  nowhere,  flying 
through  the  air,  aimed  at  his  hardhat.  A  direct  hit  would  produce  a  thunking 
sound,  deeply  satisfying  to  all  the  quietly  attending  onlookers.  Even  this  failed  to 
improve  his  humour.  So,  the  pebbles  got  larger.  Lunchbucket  would  involve 
himself  in  something  and  forget  to  pay  attention.  Then,  “thunk!” — a  well-aimed 
stone  would  nail  him  on  the  noggin,  producing  a  burst  of  irritated  and  ineffectual 
fury.  Quiet  amusement  would  ripple  down  the  rail  line.  After  a  few  days  of  this, 
no  wiser,  and  carrying  a  few  bruises,  Lunchbucket  vanished. 

Men  enforce  a  code  of  behaviour  on  each  other,  when  working  together.  Do 
your  work.  Pull  your  weight.  Stay  awake  and  pay  attention.  Don’t  whine  or  be 
touchy.  Stand  up  for  your  friends.  Don’t  suck  up  and  don’t  snitch.  Don’t  be  a 
slave  to  stupid  rules.  Don’t,  in  the  immortal  words  of  Arnold  Schwarzenegger, 
be  a  girlie  man.  Don’t  be  dependent.  At  all.  Ever.  Period.  The  harassment  that  is 
part  of  acceptance  on  a  working  crew  is  a  test:  are  you  tough,  entertaining, 
competent  and  reliable?  If  not,  go  away.  Simple  as  that.  We  don’t  need  to  feel 
sorry  for  you.  We  don’t  want  to  put  up  with  your  narcissism,  and  we  don’t  want 
to  do  your  work. 

There  was  a  famous  advertisement  in  the  form  of  a  comic  strip  issued  a  few 
decades  ago  by  the  bodybuilder  Charles  Atlas.  It  was  titled  “The  Insult  that 
Made  a  Man  out  of  Mac”  and  could  be  found  in  almost  every  comic  book,  most 
of  which  were  read  by  boys.  Mac,  the  protagonist,  is  sitting  on  a  beach  blanket 
with  an  attractive  young  woman.  A  bully  runs  by,  and  kicks  sand  in  both  their 
faces.  Mac  objects.  The  much  larger  man  grabs  him  by  the  arm  and  says,  “Listen 
here.  I’d  smash  your  face  ....  Only  you’re  so  skinny  you  might  dry  up  and  blow 
away.”  The  bully  departs.  Mac  says  to  the  girl,  “The  big  bully!  I’ll  get  even  some 
day.”  She  adopts  a  provocative  pose,  and  says,  “Oh,  don’t  let  it  bother  you,  little 
boy.”  Mac  goes  home,  considers  his  pathetic  physique,  and  buys  the  Atlas 


program.  Soon,  he  has  a  new  body.  The  next  time  he  goes  to  the  beach,  he 
punches  the  bully  in  the  nose.  The  now-admiring  girl  clings  to  his  arm.  “Oh, 
Mac!”  she  says.  “You’re  a  real  man  after  all.” 

That  ad  is  famous  for  a  reason.  It  summarizes  human  sexual  psychology  in 
seven  straightforward  panels.  The  too-weak  young  man  is  embarrassed  and  self- 
conscious,  as  he  should  be.  What  good  is  he?  He  gets  put  down  by  other  men 
and,  worse,  by  desirable  women.  Instead  of  drowning  in  resentment,  and 
skulking  off  to  his  basement  to  play  video  games  in  his  underwear,  covered  with 
Cheetos  dust,  he  presents  himself  with  what  Alfred  Adler,  Freud’s  most  practical 
colleague,  called  a  “compensatory  fantasy.”  The  goal  of  such  a  fantasy  is  not 
so  much  wish-fulfillment,  as  illumination  of  a  genuine  path  forward.  Mac  takes 
serious  note  of  his  scarecrow-like  build  and  decides  that  he  should  develop  a 
stronger  body.  More  importantly,  he  puts  his  plan  into  action.  He  identifies  with 
the  part  of  himself  that  could  transcend  his  current  state,  and  becomes  the  hero 
of  his  own  adventure.  He  goes  back  to  the  beach,  and  punches  the  bully  in  the 
nose.  Mac  wins.  So  does  his  eventual  girlfriend.  So  does  everybody  else. 

It  is  to  women’s  clear  advantage  that  men  do  not  happily  put  up  with 
dependency  among  themselves.  Part  of  the  reason  that  so  many  a  working-class 
woman  does  not  marry,  now,  as  we  have  alluded  to,  is  because  she  does  not  want 
to  look  after  a  man,  struggling  for  employment,  as  well  as  her  children.  And  fair 
enough.  A  woman  should  look  after  her  children — although  that  is  not  all  she 
should  do.  And  a  man  should  look  after  a  woman  and  children — although  that  is 
not  all  he  should  do.  But  a  woman  should  not  look  after  a  man,  because  she  must 
look  after  children,  and  a  man  should  not  be  a  child.  This  means  that  he  must  not 
be  dependent.  This  is  one  of  the  reasons  that  men  have  little  patience  for 
dependent  men.  And  let  us  not  forget:  wicked  women  may  produce  dependent 
sons,  may  support  and  even  marry  dependent  men,  but  awake  and  conscious 
women  want  an  awake  and  conscious  partner. 

If  is  for  this  reason  that  Nelson  Muntz  of  The  Simpsons  is  so  necessary  to  the 
small  social  group  that  surrounds  Homer’s  antihero  son,  Bart.  Without  Nelson, 
King  of  the  Bullies,  the  school  would  soon  be  overrun  by  resentful,  touchy 
Milhouses,  narcissistic,  intellectual  Martin  Princes,  soft,  chocolate-gorging 
German  children,  and  infantile  Ralph  Wiggums.  Muntz  is  a  corrective,  a  tough, 
self-sufficient  kid  who  uses  his  own  capacity  for  contempt  to  decide  what  line  of 
immature  and  pathetic  behaviour  simply  cannot  be  crossed.  Part  of  the  genius  of 
The  Simpsons  is  its  writers’  refusal  to  simply  write  Nelson  off  as  an  irredeemable 
bully.  Abandoned  by  his  worthless  father,  neglected,  thankfully,  by  his 
thoughtless  slut  of  a  mother,  Nelson  does  pretty  well,  everything  considered. 

He’s  even  of  romantic  interest  to  the  thoroughly  progressive  Lisa,  much  to  her 


dismay  and  confusion  (for  much  the  same  reasons  that  Fifty  Shades  of  Grey 
became  a  worldwide  phenomenon). 

When  softness  and  harmlessness  become  the  only  consciously  acceptable 
virtues,  then  hardness  and  dominance  will  start  to  exert  an  unconscious 
fascination.  Partly  what  this  means  for  the  future  is  that  if  men  are  pushed  too 
hard  to  feminize,  they  will  become  more  and  more  interested  in  harsh,  fascist 
political  ideology.  Fight  Club,  perhaps  the  most  fascist  popular  film  made  in 
recent  years  by  Hollywood,  with  the  possible  exception  of  the  Iron  Man  series, 
provides  a  perfect  example  of  such  inevitable  attraction.  The  populist 
groundswell  of  support  for  Donald  Trump  in  the  US  is  part  of  the  same  process, 
as  is  (in  far  more  sinister  form)  the  recent  rise  of  far-right  political  parties  even 
in  such  moderate  and  liberal  places  as  Holland,  Sweden  and  Norway. 

Men  have  to  toughen  up.  Men  demand  it,  and  women  want  it,  even  though 
they  may  not  approve  of  the  harsh  and  contemptuous  attitude  that  is  part  and 
parcel  of  the  socially  demanding  process  that  fosters  and  then  enforces  that 
toughness.  Some  women  don’t  like  losing  their  baby  boys,  so  they  keep  them 
forever.  Some  women  don’t  like  men,  and  would  rather  have  a  submissive  mate, 
even  if  he  is  useless.  This  also  provides  them  with  plenty  to  feel  sorry  for 
themselves  about,  as  well.  The  pleasures  of  such  self-pity  should  not  be 
underestimated. 

Men  toughen  up  by  pushing  themselves,  and  by  pushing  each  other.  When  I 
was  a  teenager,  the  boys  were  much  more  likely  to  get  into  car  accidents  than  the 
girls  (as  they  still  are).  This  was  because  they  were  out  spinning  donuts  at  night 
in  icy  parking  lots.  They  were  drag  racing  and  driving  their  cars  over  the 
roadless  hills  extending  from  the  nearby  river  up  to  the  level  land  hundreds  of 
feet  higher.  They  were  more  likely  to  fight  physically,  and  to  skip  class,  and  to 
tell  the  teachers  off,  and  to  quit  school  because  they  were  tired  of  raising  their 
hands  for  permission  to  go  to  the  bathroom  when  they  were  big  and  strong 
enough  to  work  on  the  oil  rigs.  They  were  more  likely  to  race  their  motorbikes 
on  frozen  lakes  in  the  winter.  Like  the  skateboarders,  and  crane  climbers,  and 
free  runners,  they  were  doing  dangerous  things,  trying  to  make  themselves 
useful.  When  this  process  goes  too  far,  boys  (and  men)  drift  into  the  antisocial 
behavior  which  is  far  more  prevalent  in  males  than  in  females.  That  does  not 
mean  that  every  manifestation  of  daring  and  courage  is  criminal. 

When  the  boys  were  spinning  donuts,  they  were  also  testing  the  limits  of  their 
cars,  their  ability  as  drivers,  and  their  capacity  for  control,  in  an  out-of-control 
situation.  When  they  told  off  the  teachers,  they  were  pushing  against  authority,  to 
see  if  there  was  any  real  authority  there — the  kind  that  could  be  relied  on,  in 
principle,  in  a  crisis.  When  they  quit  school,  they  went  to  work  as  rig  roughnecks 


when  it  was  forty  bloody  degrees  below  zero.  It  wasn’t  weakness  that  propelled 
so  many  out  of  the  classroom,  where  a  better  future  arguably  awaited.  It  was 
strength. 

If  they’re  healthy,  women  don’t  want  boys.  They  want  men.  They  want 
someone  to  contend  with;  someone  to  grapple  with.  If  they’re  tough,  they  want 
someone  tougher.  If  they’re  smart,  they  want  someone  smarter.  They  desire 
someone  who  brings  to  the  table  something  they  can’t  already  provide.  This 
often  makes  it  hard  for  tough,  smart,  attractive  women  to  find  mates:  there  just 
aren’t  that  many  men  around  who  can  outclass  them  enough  to  be  considered 
desirable  (who  are  higher,  as  one  research  publication  put  it,  in  “income, 
education,  self-confidence,  intelligence,  dominance  and  social  position”).  The 
spirit  that  interferes  when  boys  are  trying  to  become  men  is,  therefore,  no  more 
friend  to  woman  than  it  is  to  man.  It  will  object,  just  as  vociferously  and  self- 
righteously  (“you  can’t  do  it,  it’s  too  dangerous”)  when  little  girls  try  to  stand  on 
their  own  two  feet.  It  negates  consciousness.  It’s  antihuman,  desirous  of  failure, 
jealous,  resentful  and  destructive.  No  one  truly  on  the  side  of  humanity  would 
ally  him  or  herself  with  such  a  thing.  No  one  aiming  at  moving  up  would  allow 
him  or  herself  to  become  possessed  by  such  a  thing.  And  if  you  think  tough  men 
are  dangerous,  wait  until  you  see  what  weak  men  are  capable  of. 

Leave  children  alone  when  they  are  skateboarding. 


RULE  12 


PET  A  CAT  WHEN  YOU  ENCOUNTER  ONE  ON  THE 
STREET 

DOGS  ARE  OK  TOO 

I  am  going  to  start  this  chapter  by  stating  directly  that  I  own  a  dog,  an  American 
Eskimo,  one  of  the  many  variants  of  the  basic  spitz  type.  They  were  known  as 
German  spitzes  until  the  First  World  War  made  it  verboten  to  admit  that  anything 
good  could  come  from  Germany.  American  Eskimos  are  among  the  most 
beautiful  of  dogs,  with  a  pointed,  classic  wolf  face,  upright  ears,  a  long  thick 
coat,  and  a  curly  tail.  They  are  also  very  intelligent.  Our  dog,  whose  name  is 
Sikko  (which  means  “ice”  in  an  Inuit  language,  according  to  my  daughter,  who 
named  him),  learns  tricks  very  rapidly,  and  can  do  so  even  now  that  he’s  old.  I 
taught  him  a  new  stunt,  recently,  when  he  turned  thirteen.  He  already  knew  how 
to  shake  a  paw,  and  to  balance  a  treat  on  his  nose.  I  taught  him  to  do  both  at  the 
same  time.  However,  it’s  not  at  all  clear  he  enjoys  it. 

We  bought  Sikko  for  my  daughter,  Mikhaila,  when  she  was  about  ten  years 
old.  He  was  an  unbearably  cute  pup.  Small  nose  and  ears,  rounded  face,  big 
eyes,  awkward  movements — these  features  automatically  elicit  caretaking 
behaviour  from  humans,  male  and  female  alike.  This  was  certainly  the  case 
with  Mikhaila,  who  was  also  occupied  with  the  care  of  bearded  dragons, 
gekkoes,  ball  pythons,  chameleons,  iguanas  and  a  twenty-pound,  thirty-two- 
inch-long  Flemish  Giant  rabbit  named  George,  who  nibbled  on  everything  in  the 
house  and  frequently  escaped  (to  the  great  consternation  of  those  who  then  spied 
his  improbably  large  form  in  their  tiny  mid-city  gardens).  She  had  all  these 
animals  because  she  was  allergic  to  the  more  typical  pets — excepting  Sikko,  who 
had  the  additional  advantage  of  being  hypo-allergenic. 

Sikko  garnered  fifty  nicknames  (we  counted)  which  varied  broadly  in  their 
emotional  tone,  and  reflected  both  the  affection  in  which  he  was  held  and  our 
occasional  frustration  with  his  beastly  habits.  Scumdog  was  probably  my 
favorite,  but  I  also  held  Rathound,  Furball  and  Suck-dog  in  rather  high  esteem. 
The  kids  used  Sneak  and  Squeak  (sometimes  with  an  appended  o)  most 
frequently,  but  accompanied  it  with  Snooky,  Ugdog,  and  Snorfalopogus  (horrible 
though  it  is  to  admit).  Snorbs  is  Mikhaila’s  current  moniker  of  choice.  She  uses  it 
to  greet  him  after  a  prolonged  absence.  For  full  effect,  it  must  be  uttered  in  a 
high-pitched  and  surprised  voice. 


Sikko  also  happens  to  have  his  own  Instagram  hashtag:  #JudgementalSikko. 

I  am  describing  my  dog  instead  of  writing  directly  about  cats  because  I  don’t 
wish  to  run  afoul  of  a  phenomenon  known  as  “minimal  group  identification,” 
discovered  by  the  social  psychologist  Henri  Tajfel.  Tajfel  brought  his  research 
subjects  into  his  lab  and  sat  them  down  in  front  of  a  screen,  onto  which  he 
flashed  a  number  of  dots.  The  subjects  were  asked  to  estimate  their  quantity. 
Then  he  categorized  his  subjects  as  overestimators  vs  underestimators,  as  well  as 
accurate  vs  inaccurate,  and  put  them  into  groups  corresponding  to  their 
performance.  Then  he  asked  them  to  divide  money  among  the  members  of  all  the 
groups. 

Tajfel  found  that  his  subjects  displayed  a  marked  preference  for  their  own 
group  members,  rejecting  an  egalitarian  distribution  strategy  and 
disproportionately  rewarding  those  with  whom  they  now  identified.  Other 
researchers  have  assigned  people  to  different  groups  using  ever  more  arbitrary 
strategies,  such  as  flipping  a  coin.  It  didn’t  matter,  even  when  the  subjects  were 
informed  of  the  way  the  groups  were  composed.  People  still  favoured  the  co¬ 
members  of  their  personal  group. 

Tajfel’s  studies  demonstrated  two  things:  first,  that  people  are  social;  second, 
that  people  are  antisocial.  People  are  social  because  they  like  the  members  of 
their  own  group.  People  are  antisocial  because  they  don’t  like  the  members  of 
other  groups.  Exactly  why  this  is  so  has  been  the  subject  of  continual  debate.  I 
think  it  might  be  a  solution  to  a  complex  problem  of  optimization.  Such 
problems  arise,  for  example,  when  two  or  more  factors  are  important,  but  none 
cannot  be  maximized  without  diminishing  the  others.  A  problem  of  this  sort 
emerges,  for  example,  because  of  the  antipathy  between  cooperation  and 
competition,  both  of  which  are  socially  and  psychologically  desirable. 
Cooperation  is  for  safety,  security  and  companionship.  Competition  is  for 
personal  growth  and  status.  However,  if  a  given  group  is  too  small,  it  has  no 
power  or  prestige,  and  cannot  fend  off  other  groups.  In  consequence,  being  one 
of  its  members  is  not  that  useful.  If  the  group  is  too  large,  however,  the 
probability  of  climbing  near  or  to  the  top  declines.  So,  it  becomes  too  hard  to  get 
ahead.  Perhaps  people  identify  with  groups  at  the  flip  of  a  coin  because  they 
deeply  want  to  organize  themselves,  protect  themselves,  and  still  have  some 
reasonable  probability  of  climbing  the  dominance  hierarchy.  Then  they  favour 
their  own  group,  because  favouring  it  helps  it  thrive — and  climbing  something 
that  is  failing  is  not  a  useful  strategy. 

In  any  case,  it  is  because  of  Tajfel’s  minimal-conditions  discovery  that  I  began 
this  cat-related  chapter  with  a  description  of  my  dog.  Otherwise,  the  mere 
mention  of  a  cat  in  the  title  would  be  enough  to  turn  many  dog  people  against 


me,  just  because  I  didn’t  include  canines  in  the  group  of  entities  that  should  be 
petted.  Since  I  also  like  dogs,  there  is  no  reason  for  me  to  suffer  such  a  fate.  So, 
if  you  like  to  pet  dogs  when  you  meet  them  on  the  street,  don’t  feel  obliged  to 
hate  me.  Rest  assured,  instead,  that  this  is  also  an  activity  of  which  I  approve.  I 
would  also  like  to  apologize  to  all  the  cat  people  who  now  feel  slighted,  because 
they  were  hoping  for  a  cat  story  but  had  to  read  all  this  dog-related  material. 
Perhaps  they  might  be  satisfied  by  some  assurance  that  cats  do  illustrate  the 
point  I  want  to  make  better,  and  that  I  will  eventually  discuss  them.  First, 
however,  to  other  things. 


Suffering  and  the  Limitations  of  Being 

The  idea  that  life  is  suffering  is  a  tenet,  in  one  form  or  another,  of  every  major 
religious  doctrine,  as  we  have  already  discussed.  Buddhists  state  it  directly. 
Christians  illustrate  it  with  the  cross.  Jews  commemorate  the  suffering  endured 
over  centuries.  Such  reasoning  universally  characterizes  the  great  creeds, 
because  human  beings  are  intrinsically  fragile.  We  can  be  damaged,  even 
broken,  emotionally  and  physically,  and  we  are  all  subject  to  the  depredations  of 
aging  and  loss.  This  is  a  dismal  set  of  facts,  and  it  is  reasonable  to  wonder  how 
we  can  expect  to  thrive  and  be  happy  (or  even  to  want  to  exist,  sometimes)  under 
such  conditions. 

I  was  speaking  recently  with  a  client  whose  husband  had  been  engaging  in  a 
successful  battle  with  cancer  for  an  agonizing  period  of  five  years.  They  had 
both  held  up  remarkably  and  courageously  over  this  period.  However,  he  fell 
prey  to  the  tendency  of  that  dread  condition  to  metastasize  and,  in  consequence, 
had  been  given  very  little  time  to  live.  It  is  perhaps  hardest  to  hear  terrible  news 
like  this  when  you  are  still  in  the  fragile  post-recovery  state  that  occurs  after 
dealing  successfully  with  previous  bad  news.  Tragedy  at  such  a  time  seems 
particularly  unfair.  It  is  the  sort  of  thing  that  can  make  you  distrust  even  hope 
itself.  It’s  frequently  sufficient  to  cause  genuine  trauma.  My  client  and  I 
discussed  a  number  of  issues,  some  philosophical  and  abstract,  some  more 
concrete.  I  shared  with  her  some  of  the  thoughts  that  I  had  developed  about  the 
whys  and  wherefores  of  human  vulnerability. 

When  my  son,  Julian,  was  about  three,  he  was  particularly  cute.  He’s  twenty 
years  older  than  that  now,  but  still  quite  cute  (a  compliment  I’m  sure  he’ll 
particularly  enjoy  reading).  Because  of  him,  I  thought  a  lot  about  the  fragility  of 
small  children.  A  three-year-old  is  easily  damaged.  Dogs  can  bite  him.  Cars  can 
hit  him.  Mean  kids  can  push  him  over.  He  can  get  sick  (and  sometimes  did). 
Julian  was  prone  to  high  fevers  and  the  delirium  they  sometimes  produce. 


Sometimes  I  had  to  take  him  into  the  shower  with  me  and  cool  him  off  when  he 
was  hallucinating,  or  even  fighting  with  me,  in  his  feverish  state.  There  are  few 
things  that  make  it  harder  to  accept  the  fundamental  limitations  of  human 
existence  than  a  sick  child. 

Mikhaila,  a  year  and  a  few  months  older  than  Julian,  also  had  her  problems. 
When  she  was  two,  I  would  lift  her  up  on  my  shoulders  and  carry  her  around. 
Kids  enjoy  that.  Afterwards,  however,  when  I  put  her  feet  back  on  the  ground, 
she  would  sit  down  and  cry.  So,  I  stopped  doing  it.  That  seemed  to  be  the  end  of 
the  problem — with  a  seemingly  minor  exception.  My  wife,  Tammy,  told  me  that 
something  was  wrong  with  Mikhaila’s  gait.  I  couldn’t  see  it.  Tammy  thought  it 
might  be  related  to  her  reaction  to  being  carried  on  my  shoulders. 

Mikhaila  was  a  sunny  child  and  very  easy  to  get  along  with.  One  day  when 
she  was  about  fourteen  months  old  I  took  her  along  with  Tammy  and  her 
grandparents  to  Cape  Cod,  when  we  lived  in  Boston.  When  we  got  there,  Tammy 
and  her  mom  and  dad  walked  ahead,  and  left  me  with  Mikhaila  in  the  car.  We 
were  in  the  front  seat.  She  was  lying  there  in  the  sun,  babbling  away.  I  leaned 
over  to  hear  what  she  was  saying. 

“Happy,  happy,  happy,  happy,  happy.” 

That’s  what  she  was  like. 

When  she  turned  six,  however,  she  started  to  get  mopey.  It  was  hard  to  get  her 
out  of  bed  in  the  morning.  She  put  on  her  clothes  very  slowly.  When  we  walked 
somewhere,  she  lagged  behind.  She  complained  that  her  feet  hurt  and  that  her 
shoes  didn’t  fit.  We  bought  her  ten  different  pairs,  but  it  didn’t  help.  She  went  to 
school,  and  held  her  head  up,  and  behaved  properly.  But  when  she  came  home, 
and  saw  her  Mom,  she  would  break  into  tears. 

We  had  recently  moved  from  Boston  to  Toronto,  and  attributed  these  changes 
to  the  stress  of  the  move.  But  it  didn’t  get  better.  Mikhaila  began  to  walk  up  and 
down  stairs  one  step  at  a  time.  She  began  to  move  like  someone  much  older.  She 
complained  if  you  held  her  hand.  (One  time,  much  later,  she  asked  me,  “Dad, 
when  you  played  This  little  piggy,’  with  me  when  I  was  little,  was  it  supposed  to 
hurt?”  Things  you  learn  too  late  . . .). 

A  physician  at  our  local  medical  clinic  told  us,  “Sometimes  children  have 
growing  pains.  They’re  normal.  But  you  could  think  about  taking  her  to  see  a 
physiotherapist.”  So,  we  did.  The  physiotherapist  tried  to  rotate  Mikhaila’s  heel. 
It  didn’t  move.  That  was  not  good.  The  physio  told  us,  “Your  daughter  has 
juvenile  rheumatoid  arthritis.”  This  was  not  what  we  wanted  to  hear.  We  did  not 
like  that  physiotherapist.  We  went  back  to  the  medical  clinic.  Another  physician 
there  told  us  to  take  Mikhaila  to  the  Hospital  for  Sick  Children.  The  doctor  said, 
“Take  her  to  the  emergency  room.  That  way,  you  will  be  able  to  see  a 


rheumatologist  quickly.”  Mikhaila  had  arthritis,  all  right.  The  physio,  bearer  of 
unwelcome  news,  was  correct.  Thirty-seven  affected  joints.  Severe  polyarticular 
juvenile  idiopathic  arthritis  (JIA).  Cause?  Unknown.  Prognosis?  Multiple  early 
joint  replacements. 

What  sort  of  God  would  make  a  world  where  such  a  thing  could  happen,  at 
all? — much  less  to  an  innocent  and  happy  little  girl?  It’s  a  question  of  absolutely 
fundamental  import,  for  believer  and  non-believer  alike.  It’s  an  issue  addressed 
(as  are  so  many  difficult  matters)  in  The  Brothers  Karamazov,  the  great  novel  by 
Dostoevsky  we  began  to  discuss  in  Rule  7.  Dostoevsky  expresses  his  doubts 
about  the  propriety  of  Being  through  the  character  of  Ivan  who,  if  you 
remember,  is  the  articulate,  handsome,  sophisticated  brother  (and  greatest 
adversary)  of  the  monastic  novitiate  Alyosha.  “It’s  not  God  I  don’t  accept. 
Understand  this,”  says  Ivan.  “I  do  not  accept  the  world  that  He  created,  this 
world  of  God’s,  and  cannot  agree  with  it.” 

Ivan  tells  Alyosha  a  story  about  a  small  girl  whose  parents  punished  her  by 
locking  her  in  a  freezing  outhouse  overnight  (a  story  Dostoevsky  culled  from  a 
newspaper  of  the  time).  “Can  you  just  see  those  two  snoozing  away  while  their 
daughter  was  crying  all  night?”  says  Ivan.  “And  imagine  this  little  child:  unable 
to  understand  what  was  happening  to  her,  beating  her  frozen  little  chest  and 
crying  meek  little  tears,  begging  ‘gentle  Jesus’  to  get  her  out  of  that  horrible 
place!  . . .  Alyosha:  if  you  were  somehow  promised  that  the  world  could  finally 
have  complete  and  total  peace — but  only  on  the  condition  that  you  tortured  one 
little  child  to  death — say,  that  girl  who  was  freezing  in  the  outhouse  . . .  would 
you  do  it?”  Alyosha  demurs.  “No,  I  would  not,”  he  says,  softly.  He  would  not 
do  what  God  seems  to  freely  allow. 

I  had  realized  something  relevant  to  this,  years  before,  about  three-year-old 
Julian  (remember  him?  :)).  I  thought,  “I  love  my  son.  He’s  three,  and  cute  and 
little  and  comical.  But  I  am  also  afraid  for  him,  because  he  could  be  hurt.  If  I  had 
the  power  to  change  that,  what  might  I  do?”  I  thought,  “He  could  be  twenty  feet 
tall  instead  of  forty  inches.  Nobody  could  push  him  over  then.  He  could  be  made 
of  titanium,  instead  of  flesh  and  bone.  Then,  if  some  brat  bounced  a  toy  truck  off 
his  noggin,  he  wouldn’t  care.  He  could  have  a  computer-enhanced  brain.  And 
even  if  he  was  damaged,  somehow,  his  parts  could  be  immediately  replaced. 
Problem  solved!”  But  no — not  problem  solved — and  not  just  because  such 
things  are  currently  impossible.  Artificially  fortifying  Julian  would  have  been 
the  same  as  destroying  him.  Instead  of  his  little  three-year-old  self,  he  would  be 
a  cold,  steel-hard  robot.  That  wouldn’t  be  Julian.  It  would  be  a  monster.  I  came 
to  realize  through  such  thoughts  that  what  can  be  truly  loved  about  a  person  is 
inseparable  from  their  limitations.  Julian  wouldn’t  have  been  little  and  cute  and 


lovable  if  he  wasn’t  also  prone  to  illness,  and  loss,  and  pain,  and  anxiety.  Since  I 
loved  him  a  lot,  I  decided  that  he  was  all  right  the  way  he  was,  despite  his 
fragility. 

It’s  been  harder  with  my  daughter.  As  her  disease  progressed,  I  began  to 
piggy-back  her  around  (not  on  my  shoulders)  when  we  went  for  walks.  She 
started  taking  oral  naproxen  and  methotrexate,  the  latter  a  powerful 
chemotherapy  agent.  She  had  a  number  of  cortisol  injections  (wrists,  shoulders, 
ankles,  elbows,  knees,  hips,  fingers,  toes  and  tendons),  all  under  general 
anaesthetic.  This  helped  temporarily,  but  her  decline  continued.  One  day  Tammy 
took  Mikhaila  to  the  zoo.  She  pushed  her  around  in  a  wheelchair. 

That  was  not  a  good  day. 

Her  rheumatologist  suggested  prednisone,  a  corticosteroid,  long  used  to  fight 
inflammation.  But  prednisone  has  many  side  effects,  not  the  least  of  which  is 
severe  facial  swelling.  It  wasn’t  clear  that  this  was  better  than  the  arthritis,  not 
for  a  little  girl.  Fortunately,  if  that  is  the  right  word,  the  rheumatologist  told  us  of 
a  new  drug.  It  had  been  used  previously,  but  only  on  adults.  So  Mikhaila  became 
the  first  Canadian  child  to  receive  etanercept,  a  “biological”  specifically 
designed  for  autoimmune  diseases.  Tammy  accidentally  administered  ten  times 
the  recommended  dose  the  first  few  injections.  Poof!  Mikhaila  was  fixed.  A  few 
weeks  after  the  trip  to  the  zoo,  she  was  zipping  around,  playing  little  league 
soccer.  Tammy  spent  all  summer  just  watching  her  mn. 

We  wanted  Mikhaila  to  control  as  much  of  her  life  as  she  could.  She  had 
always  been  strongly  motivated  by  money.  One  day  we  found  her  outside, 
surrounded  by  the  books  of  her  early  childhood,  selling  them  to  passersby.  I  sat 
her  down  one  evening  and  told  her  that  I  would  give  her  fifty  dollars  if  she  could 
do  the  injection  herself.  She  was  eight.  She  struggled  for  thirty-five  minutes, 
holding  the  needle  close  to  her  thigh.  Then  she  did  it.  Next  time  I  paid  her 
twenty  dollars,  but  only  gave  her  ten  minutes.  Then  it  was  ten  dollars,  and  five 
minutes.  We  stayed  at  ten  for  quite  a  while.  It  was  a  bargain. 

After  a  few  years,  Mikhaila  became  completely  symptom-free.  The 
rheumatologist  suggested  that  we  start  weaning  her  off  her  medications.  Some 
children  grow  out  of  JIA  when  they  hit  puberty.  No  one  knows  why.  She  began 
to  take  methotrexate  in  pill  form,  instead  of  injecting  it.  Things  were  good  for 
four  years.  Then,  one  day,  her  elbow  started  to  ache.  We  took  her  back  to  the 
hospital.  “You  only  have  one  actively  arthritic  joint,”  said  the  rheumatologist’s 
assistant.  It  wasn’t  “only.”  Two  isn’t  much  more  than  one,  but  one  is  a  lot  more 
than  zero.  One  meant  she  hadn’t  grown  out  of  her  arthritis,  despite  the  hiatus. 
The  news  demolished  her  for  a  month,  but  she  was  still  in  dance  class  and 
playing  ball  games  with  her  friends  on  the  street  in  front  of  our  house. 


The  rheumatologist  had  some  more  unpleasant  things  to  say  the  next 
September,  when  Mikhaila  started  grade  eleven.  An  MRI  revealed  joint 
deterioration  at  the  hip.  She  told  Mikhaila,  “Your  hip  will  have  to  be  replaced 
before  you  turn  thirty.”  Perhaps  the  damage  had  been  done,  before  the  etanercept 
worked  its  miracle?  We  didn’t  know.  It  was  ominous  news.  One  day,  a  few 
weeks  after,  Mikhaila  was  playing  ball  hockey  in  her  high  school  gym.  Her  hip 
locked  up.  She  had  to  hobble  off  the  court.  It  started  to  hurt  more  and  more.  The 
rheumatologist  said,  “Some  of  your  femur  appears  to  be  dead.  You  don’t  need  a 
hip  replacement  when  you’re  thirty.  You  need  one  now.” 

As  I  sat  with  my  client — as  she  discussed  her  husband’s  advancing  illness — 
we  discussed  the  fragility  of  life,  the  catastrophe  of  existence,  and  the  sense  of 
nihilism  evoked  by  the  spectre  of  death.  I  started  with  my  thoughts  about  my 
son.  She  had  asked,  like  everyone  in  her  situation,  “Why  my  husband?  Why  me? 
Why  this?”  My  realization  of  the  tight  interlinking  between  vulnerability  and 
Being  was  the  best  answer  I  had  for  her.  I  told  her  an  old  Jewish  story,  which  I 
believe  is  part  of  the  commentary  on  the  Torah.  It  begins  with  a  question, 
structured  like  a  Zen  koan.  Imagine  a  Being  who  is  omniscient,  omnipresent,  and 
omnipotent.  What  does  such  a  Being  lack?  The  answer?  Limitation. 

If  you  are  already  everything,  everywhere,  always,  there  is  nowhere  to  go  and 
nothing  to  be.  Everything  that  could  be  already  is,  and  everything  that  could 
happen  already  has.  And  it  is  for  this  reason,  so  the  story  goes,  that  God  created 
man.  No  limitation,  no  story.  No  story,  no  Being.  That  idea  has  helped  me  deal 
with  the  terrible  fragility  of  Being.  It  helped  my  client,  too.  I  don’t  want  to 
overstate  the  significance  of  this.  I  don’t  want  to  claim  that  this  somehow  makes 
it  all  OK.  She  still  faced  the  cancer  afflicting  her  husband,  just  as  I  still  faced  my 
daughter’s  terrible  illness.  But  there’s  something  to  be  said  for  recognizing  that 
existence  and  limitation  are  inextricably  linked. 

Though  thirty  spokes  may  form  the  wheel, 
it  is  the  hole  within  the  hub 
which  gives  the  wheel  utility. 

It  is  not  the  clay  the  potter  throws, 
which  gives  the  pot  its  usefulness, 
but  the  space  within  the  shape, 
from  which  the  pot  is  made. 

Without  a  door,  the  room  cannot  be  entered, 
and  without  its  windows  it  is  dark

Such  is  the  utility  of  non-existence: - 

A  realization  of  this  sort  emerged  more  recently,  in  the  pop  culture  world,  during 
the  evolution  of  the  DC  Comics  cultural  icon  Superman.  Superman  was  created 
in  1938  by  Jerry  Siegel  and  Joe  Shuster.  In  the  beginning,  he  could  move  cars, 


trains  and  even  ships.  He  could  run  faster  than  a  locomotive.  He  could  “leap  over 
tall  buildings  in  a  single  bound.”  As  he  developed  over  the  next  four  decades, 
however,  Superman’s  power  began  to  expand.  By  the  late  sixties,  he  could  fly 
faster  than  light.  He  had  super-hearing  and  X-ray  vision.  He  could  blast  heat- 
rays  from  his  eyes.  He  could  freeze  objects  and  generate  hurricanes  with  his 
breath.  He  could  move  entire  planets.  Nuclear  blasts  didn’t  faze  him.  And,  if  he 
did  get  hurt,  somehow,  he  would  immediately  heal.  Superman  became 
invulnerable. 

Then  a  strange  thing  happened.  He  got  boring.  The  more  amazing  his  abilities 
became,  the  harder  it  was  to  think  up  interesting  things  for  him  to  do.  DC  first 
overcame  this  problem  in  the  1940s.  Superman  became  vulnerable  to  the 
radiation  produced  by  kryptonite,  a  material  remnant  of  his  shattered  home 
planet.  Eventually,  more  than  two  dozen  variants  emerged.  Green  kryptonite 
weakened  Superman.  In  sufficient  dosage,  it  could  even  kill  him.  Red  caused 
him  to  behave  strangely.  Red-green  caused  him  to  mutate  (he  once  grew  a  third 
eye  in  the  back  of  his  head). 

Other  techniques  were  necessary  to  keep  Superman’s  story  compelling.  In 
1976,  he  was  scheduled  to  battle  Spiderman.  It  was  the  first  superhero  cross-over 
between  Stan  Lee’s  upstart  Marvel  Comics,  with  its  less  idealized  characters, 
and  DC,  the  owner  of  Superman  and  Batman.  But  Marvel  had  to  augment 
Spiderman’s  powers  for  the  battle  to  remain  plausible.  That  broke  the  rules  of  the 
game.  Spiderman  is  Spiderman  because  he  has  the  powers  of  a  spider.  If  he  is 
suddenly  granted  any  old  power,  he’s  not  Spiderman.  The  plot  falls  apart. 

By  the  1980s,  Superman  was  suffering  from  terminal  deus  ex  machina — a 
Latin  term  meaning  “god  from  a  machine.”  The  term  described  the  rescue  of  the 
imperilled  hero  in  ancient  Greek  and  Romans  plays  by  the  sudden  and 
miraculous  appearance  of  an  all-powerful  god.  In  badly  written  stories,  to  this 
very  day,  a  character  in  trouble  can  be  saved  or  a  failing  plot  redeemed  by  a  bit 
of  implausible  magic  or  other  chicanery  not  in  keeping  with  the  reader’s 
reasonable  expectations.  Sometimes  Marvel  Comics,  for  example,  saves  a  failing 
story  in  exactly  this  manner.  Lifeguard,  for  example,  is  an  X-Man  character  who 
can  develop  whatever  power  is  necessary  to  save  a  life.  He’s  very  handy  to  have 
around.  Other  examples  abound  in  popular  culture.  At  the  end  of  Stephen  King’s 
The  Stand,  for  example  (spoiler  alert),  God  Himself  destroys  the  novel’s  evil 
characters.  The  entire  ninth  season  (1985-86)  of  the  primetime  soap  Dallas  was 
later  revealed  as  a  dream.  Lans  object  to  such  things,  and  rightly  so.  They’ve 
been  ripped  off.  People  following  a  story  are  willing  to  suspend  disbelief  as  long 
as  the  limitations  making  the  story  possible  are  coherent  and  consistent.  Writers, 
for  their  part,  agree  to  abide  by  their  initial  decisions.  When  writers  cheat,  fans 


get  annoyed.  They  want  to  toss  the  book  in  the  fireplace,  and  throw  a  brick 
through  the  TV. 

And  that  became  Superman’s  problem:  he  developed  powers  so  extreme  that 
he  could  “deus”  himself  out  of  anything,  at  any  time.  In  consequence,  in  the 
1980s,  the  franchise  nearly  died.  Artist-writer  John  Byrne  successfully  rebooted 
it,  rewriting  Superman,  retaining  his  biography,  but  depriving  him  of  many  of  his 
new  powers.  He  could  no  longer  lift  planets,  or  shrug  off  an  H-bomb.  He  also 
became  dependent  on  the  sun  for  his  power,  like  a  reverse  vampire.  He  gained 
some  reasonable  limitations.  A  superhero  who  can  do  anything  turns  out  to  be  no 
hero  at  all.  He’s  nothing  specific,  so  he’s  nothing.  He  has  nothing  to  strive 
against,  so  he  can’t  be  admirable.  Being  of  any  reasonable  sort  appears  to 
require  limitation.  Perhaps  this  is  because  Being  requires  Becoming,  perhaps,  as 
well  as  mere  static  existence — and  to  become  is  to  become  something  more,  or 
at  least  something  different.  That  is  only  possible  for  something  limited. 

Fair  enough. 

But  what  about  the  suffering  caused  by  such  limits?  Perhaps  the  limits 
required  by  Being  are  so  extreme  that  the  whole  project  should  just  be  scrapped. 
Dostoevsky  expresses  this  idea  very  clearly  in  the  voice  of  the  protagonist  of 
Notes  from  Underground :  “So  you  see,  you  can  say  anything  about  world  history 
— anything  and  everything  that  the  most  morbid  imagination  can  think  up. 

Except  one  thing,  that  is.  It  cannot  be  said  that  world  history  is  reasonable.  The 
word  sticks  in  one’s  throat.”  Goethe’s  Mephistopheles,  the  adversary  of 
Being,  announces  his  opposition  explicitly  to  God’s  creation  in  Faust,  as  we 
have  seen.  Years  later,  Goethe  wrote  Faust,  Part  II.  He  has  the  Devil  repeat  his 
credo,  in  a  slightly  different  form,  just  to  hammer  home  the  point: 

Gone,  to  sheer  Nothing,  past  with  null  made  one! 

What  matters  our  creative  endless  toil, 

When,  at  a  snatch,  oblivion  ends  the  coil? 

“It  is  by-gone” — How  shall  this  riddle  run? 

As  good  as  if  things  never  had  begun, 

Yet  circle  back,  existence  to  possess: 

I’d  rather  have  Eternal  Emptiness. 

Anyone  can  understand  such  words,  when  a  dream  collapses,  a  marriage  ends,  or 
a  family  member  is  struck  down  by  a  devastating  disease.  How  can  reality  be 
structured  so  unbearably?  How  can  this  be? 

Perhaps,  as  the  Columbine  boys  suggested  (see  Rule  6),  it  would  be  better  not 
to  be  at  all.  Perhaps  it  would  be  even  better  if  there  was  no  Being  at  all.  But 
people  who  come  to  the  former  conclusion  are  flirting  with  suicide,  and  those 
who  come  to  the  latter  with  something  worse,  something  truly  monstrous. 


They’re  consorting  with  the  idea  of  the  destruction  of  everything.  They  are 
toying  with  genocide — and  worse.  Even  the  darkest  regions  have  still  darker 
corners.  And  what  is  truly  horrifying  is  that  such  conclusions  are  understandable, 
maybe  even  inevitable — although  not  inevitably  acted  upon.  What  is  a 
reasonable  person  to  think  when  faced,  for  example,  with  a  suffering  child?  Is  it 
not  precisely  the  reasonable  person,  the  compassionate  person,  who  would  find 
such  thoughts  occupying  his  mind?  How  could  a  good  God  allow  such  a  world 
as  this  to  exist? 

Logical  they  might  be.  Understandable,  they  might  be.  But  there  is  a  terrible 
catch  to  such  conclusions.  Acts  undertaken  in  keeping  with  them  (if  not  the 
thoughts  themselves)  inevitably  serve  to  make  a  bad  situation  even  worse. 

Hating  life,  despising  life — even  for  the  genuine  pain  that  life  inflicts — merely 
serves  to  make  life  itself  worse,  unbearably  worse.  There  is  no  genuine  protest  in 
that.  There  is  no  goodness  in  that,  only  the  desire  to  produce  suffering,  for  the 
sake  of  suffering.  That  is  the  very  essence  of  evil.  People  who  come  to  that  kind 
of  thinking  are  one  step  from  total  mayhem.  Sometimes  they  merely  lack  the 
tools.  Sometimes,  like  Stalin,  they  have  their  finger  on  the  nuclear  button. 

But  is  there  any  coherent  alternative,  given  the  self-evident  horrors  of 
existence?  Can  Being  itself,  with  its  malarial  mosquitoes,  child  soldiers  and 
degenerative  neurological  diseases,  truly  be  justified?  I’m  not  sure  I  could  have 
formulated  a  proper  answer  to  such  a  question  in  the  nineteenth  century,  before 
the  totalitarian  horrors  of  the  twentieth  were  monstrously  perpetrated  on  millions 
of  people.  I  don’t  know  that  it’s  possible  to  understand  why  such  doubts  are 
morally  impermissible  without  the  fact  of  the  Holocaust  and  the  Stalinist  purges 
and  Mao’s  catastrophic  Great  Leap  Lorward.  And  I  also  don’t  think  it  is 
possible  to  answer  the  question  by  thinking.  Thinking  leads  inexorably  to  the 
abyss.  It  did  not  work  for  Tolstoy.  It  might  not  even  have  worked  for  Nietzsche, 
who  arguably  thought  more  clearly  about  such  things  than  anyone  in  history.  But 
if  it  is  not  thinking  that  can  be  relied  upon  in  the  direst  of  situations,  what  is  left? 
Thought,  after  all,  is  the  highest  of  human  achievements,  is  it  not? 

Perhaps  not. 

Something  supersedes  thinking,  despite  its  truly  awesome  power.  When 
existence  reveals  itself  as  existentially  intolerable,  thinking  collapses  in  on  itself. 
In  such  situations — in  the  depths — it’s  noticing,  not  thinking,  that  does  the  trick. 
Perhaps  you  might  start  by  noticing  this:  when  you  love  someone,  it’s  not  despite 
their  limitations.  It’s  because  of  their  limitations.  Of  course,  it’s  complicated. 

You  don’t  have  to  be  in  love  with  every  shortcoming,  and  merely  accept.  You 
shouldn’t  stop  trying  to  make  life  better,  or  let  suffering  just  be.  But  there  appear 
to  be  limits  on  the  path  to  improvement  beyond  which  we  might  not  want  to  go, 


lest  we  sacrifice  our  humanity  itself.  Of  course,  it’s  one  thing  to  say,  “Being 
requires  limitation,”  and  then  to  go  about  happily,  when  the  sun  is  shining  and 
your  father  is  free  of  Alzheimer’s  disease  and  your  kids  are  healthy  and  your 
marriage  happy.  But  when  things  go  wrong? 

Disintegration  and  Pain 

Mikhaila  stayed  awake  many  nights  when  she  was  in  pain.  When  her  grandfather 
came  to  visit,  he  gave  her  a  few  of  his  Tylenol  3s,  which  contain  codeine.  Then 
she  could  sleep.  But  not  for  long.  Our  rheumatologist,  instrumental  in  producing 
Mikhaila’s  remission,  hit  the  limit  of  her  courage  when  dealing  with  our  child’s 
pain.  She  had  once  prescribed  opiates  to  a  young  girl,  who  became  addicted.  She 
swore  never  to  do  so  again.  She  said,  “Have  you  tried  ibuprofen?”  Mikhaila 
learned  then  that  doctors  don’t  know  everything.  Ibuprofen  for  her  was  a  crumb 
of  bread  for  a  starving  man. 

We  talked  to  a  new  doctor.  He  listened  carefully.  Then  he  helped  Mikhaila. 
First,  he  prescribed  T3s,  the  same  medication  her  grandfather  had  briefly  shared. 
This  was  brave.  Physicians  face  a  lot  of  pressure  to  avoid  the  prescription  of 
opiates — not  least  to  children.  But  opiates  work.  Soon,  however,  the  Tylenol  was 
insufficient.  She  started  taking  oxycontin,  an  opioid  known  pejoratively  as 
hillbilly  heroin.  This  controlled  her  pain,  but  produced  other  problems.  Tammy 
took  Mikhaila  out  for  lunch  a  week  after  the  prescription  started.  She  could  have 
been  drunk.  Her  speech  was  slurred.  Her  head  nodded.  This  was  not  good. 

My  sister-in-law  is  a  palliative  care  nurse.  She  thought  we  could  add  Ritalin, 
an  amphetamine  often  used  for  hyperactive  kids,  to  the  oxycontin.  The  Ritalin 
restored  Mikhaila’s  alertness  and  had  some  pain-suppressing  qualities  of  its  own 
(this  is  a  very  a  good  thing  to  know  if  you  are  ever  faced  with  someone’s 
intractable  suffering).  But  her  pain  became  increasingly  excruciating.  She  started 
to  fall.  Then  her  hip  seized  up  on  her  again,  this  time  in  the  subway  on  a  day 
when  the  escalator  was  not  working.  Her  boyfriend  carried  her  up  the  stairs.  She 
took  a  cab  home.  The  subway  was  no  longer  a  reliable  form  of  transportation. 
That  March  we  bought  Mikhaila  a  50cc  motor  scooter.  It  was  dangerous  to  let 
her  ride  it.  It  was  also  dangerous  for  her  to  lack  all  freedom.  We  chose  the 
former  danger.  She  passed  her  learner’s  exam,  which  allowed  her  to  pilot  the 
vehicle  during  the  day.  She  was  given  a  few  months  to  progress  towards  her 
permanent  licence. 

In  May  her  hip  was  replaced.  The  surgeon  was  even  able  to  adjust  for  a  pre¬ 
existent  half  centimetre  difference  in  leg  length.  The  bone  hadn’t  died,  either. 
That  was  only  a  shadow  on  the  x-ray.  Her  aunt  and  her  grandparents  came  to  see 


her.  We  had  some  better  days.  Immediately  after  the  surgery,  however,  Mikhaila 
was  placed  in  an  adult  rehabilitation  centre.  She  was  the  youngest  person  in  the 
place,  by  about  sixty  years.  Her  aged  roommate,  very  neurotic,  wouldn’t  allow 
the  lights  to  be  off,  even  at  night.  The  old  woman  couldn’t  make  it  to  the  toilet 
and  had  to  use  a  bedpan.  She  couldn’t  stand  to  have  the  door  to  her  room  closed. 
But  it  was  right  beside  the  nurses’  station,  with  its  continual  alarm  bells  and  loud 
conversations.  There  was  no  sleeping  there,  where  sleeping  was  required.  No 
visitors  were  allowed  after  7  p.m.  The  physio — the  very  reason  for  her 
placement — was  on  vacation.  The  only  person  who  helped  her  was  the  janitor, 
who  volunteered  to  move  her  to  a  multi-bed  ward  when  she  told  the  on-duty 
nurse  that  she  couldn’t  sleep.  This  was  the  same  nurse  who  had  laughed  when 
she’d  found  out  which  room  Mikhaila  had  been  assigned  to. 

She  was  supposed  to  be  there  for  six  weeks.  She  was  there  three  days.  When 
the  vacationing  physio  returned,  Mikhaila  climbed  the  rehab-centre  stairs  and 
immediately  mastered  her  additional  required  exercises.  While  she  was  doing 
that,  we  outfitted  our  home  with  the  necessary  handrails.  Then  we  took  her 
home.  All  that  pain  and  surgery — she  handled  that  fine.  The  appalling  rehab 
centre?  That  produced  post-traumatic  stress  symptoms. 

Mikhaila  enrolled  in  a  full-fledged  motorcycle  course  in  June,  so  she  could 
continue  legally  using  her  scooter.  We  were  all  terrified  by  this  necessity.  What  if 
she  fell?  What  if  she  had  an  accident?  On  the  first  day,  Mikhaila  trained  on  a  real 
motorcycle.  It  was  heavy.  She  dropped  it  several  times.  She  saw  another 
beginning  rider  tumble  and  roll  across  the  parking  lot  where  the  course  was  held. 
On  the  morning  of  the  second  day  of  the  course,  she  was  afraid  to  return.  She 
didn’t  want  to  leave  her  bed.  We  talked  for  a  good  while,  and  jointly  decided  that 
she  should  at  least  drive  back  with  Tammy  to  the  site  where  the  training  took 
place.  If  she  couldn’t  manage  it,  she  could  stay  in  the  car  until  the  course 
finished.  En  route,  her  courage  returned.  When  she  received  her  certificate, 
everyone  else  enrolled  stood  and  applauded. 

Then  her  right  ankle  disintegrated.  Her  doctors  wanted  to  fuse  the  large 
affected  bones  into  one  piece.  But  that  would  have  caused  the  other,  smaller 
bones  in  her  foot — now  facing  additional  pressure — to  deteriorate.  That’s  not  so 
intolerable,  perhaps,  when  you’re  eighty  (although  it’s  no  picnic  then  either).  But 
it’s  no  solution  when  you’re  in  your  teens.  We  insisted  upon  an  artificial 
replacement,  although  the  technology  was  new.  There  was  a  three  year-waiting 
list.  This  was  simply  not  manageable.  The  damaged  ankle  produced  much  more 
pain  than  her  previously  failing  hip.  One  bad  night  she  became  erratic  and 
illogical.  I  couldn’t  calm  her  down.  I  knew  she  was  at  her  breaking  point.  To  call 
that  stressful  is  to  say  almost  nothing. 


We  spent  weeks  and  then  months  desperately  investigating  all  sorts  of 
replacement  devices,  trying  to  assess  their  suitability.  We  looked  everywhere  for 
quicker  surgery:  India,  China,  Spain,  the  UK,  Costa  Rica,  Florida.  We  contacted 
the  Ontario  Provincial  Ministry  of  Health.  They  were  very  helpful.  They  located 
a  specialist  across  the  country,  in  Vancouver.  Mikhaila’s  ankle  was  replaced  in 
November.  Post-surgery,  she  was  in  absolute  agony.  Her  foot  was  mispositioned. 
The  cast  was  compressing  skin  against  bone.  The  clinic  was  unwilling  to  give 
her  enough  oxycontin  to  control  her  pain.  She  had  built  up  a  high  level  of 
tolerance  because  of  her  previous  use. 

When  she  returned  home,  in  less  pain,  Mikhaila  started  to  taper  off  the 
opiates.  She  hated  oxycontin,  despite  its  evident  utility.  She  said  it  turned  her  life 
grey.  Perhaps  that  was  a  good  thing,  under  the  circumstances.  She  stopped  using 
it  as  soon  as  possible.  She  suffered  through  withdrawal  for  months,  with  night 
sweating  and  formication  (the  sensation  of  ants  crawling  upside  down  under  her 
skin).  She  became  unable  to  experience  any  pleasure.  That  was  another  effect  of 
opiate  withdrawal. 

During  much  of  this  period,  we  were  overwhelmed.  The  demands  of  everyday 
life  don’t  stop,  just  because  you  have  been  laid  low  by  a  catastrophe.  Everything 
that  you  always  do  still  has  to  be  done.  So  how  do  you  manage?  Here  are  some 
things  we  learned: 

Set  aside  some  time  to  talk  and  to  think  about  the  illness  or  other  crisis  and 
how  it  should  be  managed  every  day.  Do  not  talk  or  think  about  it  otherwise.  If 
you  do  not  limit  its  effect,  you  will  become  exhausted,  and  everything  will  spiral 
into  the  ground.  This  is  not  helpful.  Conserve  your  strength.  You’re  in  a  war,  not 
a  battle,  and  a  war  is  composed  of  many  battles.  You  must  stay  functional 
through  all  of  them.  When  worries  associated  with  the  crisis  arise  at  other  times, 
remind  yourself  that  you  will  think  them  through,  during  the  scheduled  period. 
This  usually  works.  The  parts  of  your  brain  that  generate  anxiety  are  more 
interested  in  the  fact  that  there  is  a  plan  than  in  the  details  of  the  plan.  Don’t 
schedule  your  time  to  think  in  the  evening  or  at  night.  Then  you  won’t  be  able  to 
sleep.  If  you  can’t  sleep,  then  everything  will  go  rapidly  downhill. 

Shift  the  unit  of  time  you  use  to  frame  your  life.  When  the  sun  is  shining,  and 
times  are  good,  and  the  crops  are  bountiful,  you  can  make  your  plans  for  the  next 
month,  and  the  next  year,  and  the  next  five  years.  You  can  even  dream  a  decade 
ahead.  But  you  can’t  do  that  when  your  leg  is  clamped  firmly  in  a  crocodile’s 
jaws.  “Sufficient  unto  the  day  are  the  evils  thereof” — that  is  Matthew  6:34.  It  is 
often  interpreted  as  “live  in  the  present,  without  a  care  for  tomorrow.”  This  is  not 
what  it  means.  That  injunction  must  be  interpreted  in  the  context  of  the  Sermon 
on  the  Mount,  of  which  it  is  an  integral  part.  That  sermon  distills  the  ten  “Thou- 


shalt-nots”  of  the  Commandments  of  Moses  into  a  single  prescriptive  “Thou 
shalt.”  Christ  enjoins  His  followers  to  place  faith  in  God’s  Heavenly  Kingdom, 
and  the  truth.  That’s  a  conscious  decision  to  presume  the  primary  goodness  of 
Being.  That’s  an  act  of  courage.  Aim  high,  like  Pinocchio’s  Geppetto.  Wish  upon 
a  star,  and  then  act  properly,  in  accordance  with  that  aim.  Once  you  are  aligned 
with  the  heavens,  you  can  concentrate  on  the  day.  Be  careful.  Put  the  things  you 
can  control  in  order.  Repair  what  is  in  disorder,  and  make  what  is  already  good 
better.  It  is  possible  that  you  can  manage,  if  you  are  careful.  People  are  very 
tough.  People  can  survive  through  much  pain  and  loss.  But  to  persevere  they 
must  see  the  good  in  Being.  If  they  lose  that,  they  are  truly  lost. 

Dogs,  Again — But  Finally,  Cats 

Dogs  are  like  people.  They  are  the  friends  and  allies  of  human  beings.  They  are 
social,  hierarchical,  and  domesticated.  They  are  happy  at  the  bottom  of  the 
family  pyramid.  They  pay  for  the  attention  they  receive  with  loyalty,  admiration, 
and  love.  Dogs  are  great. 

Cats,  however,  are  their  own  creatures.  They  aren’t  social  or  hierarchical 
(except  in  passing).  They  are  only  semi-domesticated.  They  don’t  do  tricks. 

They  are  friendly  on  their  own  terms.  Dogs  have  been  tamed,  but  cats  have  made 
a  decision.  They  appear  willing  to  interact  with  people,  for  some  strange  reasons 
of  their  own.  To  me,  cats  are  a  manifestation  of  nature,  of  Being,  in  an  almost 
pure  form.  Furthermore,  they  are  a  form  of  Being  that  looks  at  human  beings  and 
approves. 

When  you  meet  a  cat  on  a  street,  many  things  can  happen.  If  I  see  a  cat  at  a 
distance,  for  example,  the  evil  part  of  me  wants  to  startle  it  with  a  loud  pfft! 
sound — front  teeth  over  bottom  lip.  That  will  make  a  nervous  cat  puff  up  its  fur 
and  stand  sideways  so  it  looks  larger.  Maybe  I  shouldn’t  laugh  at  cats,  but  it’s 
hard  to  resist.  The  fact  that  they  can  be  startled  is  one  of  the  best  things  about 
them  (along  with  the  fact  that  they  are  instantly  disgruntled  and  embarrassed  by 
their  overreaction).  But  when  I  have  myself  under  proper  control,  I’ll  bend 
down,  and  call  the  cat  over,  so  I  can  pet  it.  Sometimes,  it  will  run  away. 
Sometimes,  it  will  ignore  me  completely,  because  it’s  a  cat.  But  sometimes  the 
cat  will  come  over  to  me,  push  its  head  against  my  waiting  hand,  and  be  pleased 
about  it.  Sometimes  it  will  even  roll  over,  and  arch  its  back  against  the  dusty 
concrete  (although  cats  positioned  in  that  manner  will  often  bite  and  claw  even  a 
friendly  hand). 

Across  the  street  on  which  I  live  is  a  cat  named  Ginger.  Ginger  is  a  Siamese,  a 
beautiful  cat,  very  calm  and  self-possessed.  She  is  low  in  the  Big  Five 


personality  trait  of  neuroticism,  which  is  an  index  of  anxiety,  fear  and  emotional 
pain.  Ginger  is  not  at  all  bothered  by  dogs.  Our  dog,  Sikko,  is  her  friend. 
Sometimes  when  you  call  her — sometimes  of  her  own  accord — Ginger  will  trot 
across  the  street,  tail  held  high,  with  a  little  kink  at  the  end.  Then  she  will  roll  on 
her  back  in  front  of  Sikko,  who  wags  his  tail  happily  as  a  consequence. 
Afterward,  if  she  feels  like  it,  she  might  come  visit  you,  for  a  half  a  minute.  It’s  a 
nice  break.  It’s  a  little  extra  light,  on  a  good  day,  and  a  tiny  respite,  on  a  bad  day. 

If  you  pay  careful  attention,  even  on  a  bad  day,  you  may  be  fortunate  enough 
to  be  confronted  with  small  opportunities  of  just  that  sort.  Maybe  you  will  see  a 
little  girl  dancing  on  the  street  because  she  is  all  dressed  up  in  a  ballet  costume. 
Maybe  you  will  have  a  particularly  good  cup  of  coffee  in  a  cafe  that  cares  about 
their  customers.  Maybe  you  can  steal  ten  or  twenty  minutes  to  do  some  little 
ridiculous  thing  that  distracts  you  or  reminds  you  that  you  can  laugh  at  the 
absurdity  of  existence.  Personally,  I  like  to  watch  a  Simpsons  episode  at  1.5 
times  regular  speed:  all  the  laughs;  two-thirds  the  time. 

And  maybe  when  you  are  going  for  a  walk  and  your  head  is  spinning  a  cat 
will  show  up  and  if  you  pay  attention  to  it  then  you  will  get  a  reminder  for  just 
fifteen  seconds  that  the  wonder  of  Being  might  make  up  for  the  ineradicable 
suffering  that  accompanies  it. 

Pet  a  cat  when  you  encounter  one  on  the  street. 

P.S.  Soon  after  I  wrote  this  chapter,  Mikhaila’s  surgeon  told  her  that  her 
artificial  ankle  would  have  to  be  removed,  and  her  ankle  fused.  Amputation 
waited  down  that  road.  She  had  been  in  pain  for  eight  years,  since  the 
replacement  surgery,  and  her  mobility  remained  significantly  impaired,  although 
both  were  much  better  than  before.  Four  days  later  she  happened  upon  a  new 
physiotherapist.  He  was  a  large,  powerful,  attentive  person.  He  had  specialized 
in  ankle  treatment  in  the  UK,  in  London.  He  placed  his  hands  around  her  ankle 
and  compressed  it  for  forty  seconds,  while  Mikhaila  moved  her  foot  back  and 
forth.  A  mispositioned  bone  slipped  back  where  it  belonged.  Her  pain 
disappeared.  She  never  cries  in  front  of  medical  personnel,  but  she  burst  into 
tears.  Her  knee  straightened  up.  Now  she  can  walk  long  distances,  and  traipse 
around  in  her  bare  feet.  The  calf  muscle  on  her  damaged  leg  is  growing  back. 

She  has  much  more  flexion  in  the  artificial  joint.  This  year,  she  got  married  and 
had  a  baby  girl,  Elizabeth,  named  after  my  wife’s  departed  mother. 

Things  are  good. 

For  now.

WHAT  SHALL  I  DO  WITH  MY  NEWFOUND  PEN  OF  LIGHT? 

In  late  2016  I  travelled  to  northern  California  to  meet  a  friend  and  business 
associate.  We  spent  an  evening  together  thinking  and  talking.  At  one  point  he 
took  a  pen  from  his  jacket  and  took  a  few  notes.  It  was  LED-equipped  and 
beamed  light  out  its  tip,  so  that  writing  in  the  dark  was  made  easier.  “Just 
another  gadget,”  I  thought.  Later,  however,  in  a  more  metaphorical  frame  of 
mind,  I  was  struck  quite  deeply  by  the  idea  of  a  pen  of  light.  There  was 
something  symbolic  about  it,  something  metaphysical.  We’re  all  in  the  dark, 
after  all,  much  of  the  time.  We  could  all  use  something  written  with  light  to 
guide  us  along  our  way.  I  told  him  I  wanted  to  do  some  writing,  while  we  sat  and 
conversed,  and  I  asked  him  if  he  would  give  me  the  pen,  as  a  gift.  When  he 
handed  it  over,  I  found  myself  inordinately  pleased.  Now  I  could  write 
illuminated  words  in  the  darkness!  Obviously,  it  was  important  to  do  such  a 
thing  properly.  So  I  said  to  myself,  in  all  seriousness,  “What  shall  I  do  with  my 
newfound  pen  of  light?”  There  are  two  verses  in  the  New  Testament  that  pertain 
to  such  things.  I’ve  thought  about  them  a  lot: 

Ask,  and  it  shall  given  to  you;  Seek,  and  ye  shall  find;  Knock,  and  it  shall  be  open  unto  you:  For 
everyone  who  asks  receives;  the  one  who  seeks  finds;  and  to  the  one  who  knocks,  the  door  will 
be  opened  (Matthew  7:7-7:8) 

At  first  glance,  this  seems  like  nothing  but  a  testament  to  the  magic  of  prayer,  in 
the  sense  of  entreating  God  to  grant  favours.  But  God,  whatever  or  whoever  He 
may  be,  is  no  simple  granter  of  wishes.  When  tempted  by  the  Devil  himself,  in 
the  desert — as  we  saw  in  Rule  7  (Pursue  what  is  meaningful  [not  what  is 
expedient]) — even  Christ  Himself  was  not  willing  to  call  upon  his  Father  for  a 
favour;  furthermore,  every  day,  the  prayers  of  desperate  people  go  unanswered. 
But  maybe  this  is  because  the  questions  they  contain  are  not  phrased  in  the 
proper  manner.  Perhaps  it’s  not  reasonable  to  ask  God  to  break  the  rules  of 
physics  every  time  we  fall  by  the  wayside  or  make  a  serious  error.  Perhaps,  in 
such  times,  you  can’t  put  the  cart  before  the  horse  and  simply  wish  for  your 
problem  to  be  solved  in  some  magical  manner.  Perhaps  you  could  ask,  instead, 
what  you  might  have  to  do  right  now  to  increase  your  resolve,  buttress  your 


character,  and  find  the  strength  to  go  on.  Perhaps  you  could  instead  ask  to  see  the 
truth. 

On  many  occasions  in  our  nearly  thirty  years  of  marriage  my  wife  and  I  have 
had  a  disagreement — sometimes  a  deep  disagreement.  Our  unity  appeared  to  be 
broken,  at  some  unknowably  profound  level,  and  we  were  not  able  to  easily 
resolve  the  rupture  by  talking.  We  became  trapped,  instead,  in  emotional,  angry 
and  anxious  argument.  We  agreed  that  when  such  circumstances  arose  we  would 
separate,  briefly:  she  to  one  room,  me  to  another.  This  was  often  quite  difficult, 
because  it  is  hard  to  disengage  in  the  heat  of  an  argument,  when  anger  generates 
the  desire  to  defeat  and  win.  But  it  seemed  better  than  risking  the  consequences 
of  a  dispute  that  threatened  to  spiral  out  of  control. 

Alone,  trying  to  calm  down,  we  would  each  ask  ourselves  the  same  single 
question:  What  had  we  each  done  to  contribute  to  the  situation  we  were  arguing 
about?  However  small,  however  distant ...  we  had  each  made  some  error.  Then 
we  would  reunite,  and  share  the  results  of  our  questioning:  Here’s  how  I  was 
wrong . . .. 

The  problem  with  asking  yourself  such  a  question  is  that  you  must  truly  want 
the  answer.  And  the  problem  with  doing  that  is  that  you  won’t  like  the  answer. 
When  you  are  arguing  with  someone,  you  want  to  be  right,  and  you  want  the 
other  person  to  be  wrong.  Then  it’s  them  that  has  to  sacrifice  something  and 
change,  not  you,  and  that’s  much  preferable.  If  it’s  you  that’s  wrong  and  you  that 
must  change,  then  you  have  to  reconsider  yourself — your  memories  of  the  past, 
your  manner  of  being  in  the  present,  and  your  plans  for  the  future.  Then  you 
must  resolve  to  improve  and  figure  out  how  to  do  that.  Then  you  actually  have  to 
do  it.  That’s  exhausting.  It  takes  repeated  practice,  to  instantiate  the  new 
perceptions  and  make  the  new  actions  habitual.  It’s  much  easier  just  not  to 
realize,  admit  and  engage.  It’s  much  easier  to  turn  your  attention  away  from  the 
truth  and  remain  wilfully  blind. 

But  it’s  at  such  a  point  that  you  must  decide  whether  you  want  to  be  right  or 
you  want  to  have  peace.  You  must  decide  whether  to  insist  upon  the  absolute 
correctness  of  your  view,  or  to  listen  and  negotiate.  You  don’t  get  peace  by  being 
right.  You  just  get  to  be  right,  while  your  partner  gets  to  be  wrong — defeated  and 
wrong.  Do  that  ten  thousand  times  and  your  marriage  will  be  over  (or  you  will 
wish  it  was).  To  choose  the  alternative — to  seek  peace — you  have  to  decide  that 
you  want  the  answer,  more  than  you  want  to  be  right.  That’s  the  way  out  of  the 
prison  of  your  stubborn  preconceptions.  That’s  the  prerequisite  for  negotiation. 
That’s  to  truly  abide  by  principle  of  Rule  2  (Treat  yourself  like  someone  you  are 
responsible  for  helping). 

My  wife  and  I  learned  that  if  you  ask  yourself  such  a  question,  and  you 


genuinely  desire  the  answer  (no  matter  how  disgraceful  and  terrible  and 
shameful),  then  a  memory  of  something  you  did  that  was  stupid  and  wrong  at 
some  point  in  the  generally  not-distant-enough  past  will  arise  from  the  depths  of 
your  mind.  Then  you  can  go  back  to  your  partner  and  reveal  why  you’re  an  idiot, 
and  apologize  (sincerely)  and  that  person  can  do  the  same  for  you,  and  then 
apologize  (sincerely),  and  then  you  two  idiots  will  be  able  to  talk  again.  Perhaps 
that  is  true  prayer:  the  question,  “What  have  I  done  wrong,  and  what  can  I  do 
now  to  set  things  at  least  a  little  bit  more  right?”  But  your  heart  must  be  open  to 
the  terrible  truth.  You  must  be  receptive  to  that  which  you  do  not  want  to  hear. 
When  you  decide  to  learn  about  your  faults,  so  that  they  can  be  rectified,  you 
open  a  line  of  communication  with  the  source  of  all  revelatory  thought.  Maybe 
that’s  the  same  thing  as  consulting  your  conscience.  Maybe  that’s  the  same  thing, 
in  some  manner,  as  a  discussion  with  God. 

It  was  in  that  spirit,  with  some  paper  in  front  of  me,  that  I  asked  my  question: 
What  shall  I  do  with  my  newfound  pen  of  light?  I  asked,  as  if  I  truly  wanted  the 
answer.  I  waited  for  a  reply.  I  was  holding  a  conversation  between  two  different 
elements  of  myself.  I  was  genuinely  thinking — or  listening,  in  the  sense 
described  in  Rule  9  (Assume  that  the  person  you  are  listening  to  might  know 
something  you  don’t).  That  rule  can  apply  as  much  to  yourself  as  to  others.  It 
was  me,  of  course,  who  asked  the  question — and  it  was  me,  of  course,  who 
replied.  But  those  two  me’s  were  not  the  same.  I  did  not  know  what  the  answer 
would  be.  I  was  waiting  for  it  to  appear  in  the  theatre  of  my  imagination.  I  was 
waiting  for  the  words  to  spring  out  of  the  void.  How  can  a  person  think  up 
something  that  surprises  him?  How  can  he  already  not  know  what  he  thinks? 
Where  do  new  thoughts  come  from?  Who  or  what  thinks  them? 

Since  I  had  just  been  given,  of  all  things,  a  Pen  of  Light,  which  could  write 
Illuminated  Words  in  the  darkness,  I  wanted  to  do  the  best  thing  I  could  with  it. 
So,  I  asked  the  appropriate  question — and,  almost  immediately,  an  answer 
revealed  itself:  Write  down  the  words  you  want  inscribed  on  your  soul.  I  wrote 
that  down.  That  seemed  pretty  good — a  little  on  the  romantic  side,  granted — but 
that  was  in  keeping  with  the  game.  Then  I  upped  the  ante.  I  decided  to  ask 
myself  the  hardest  questions  I  could  think  up,  and  await  their  answers.  If  you 
have  a  Pen  of  Light,  after  all,  you  should  use  it  to  answer  Difficult  Questions. 
Here  was  the  first:  What  shall  I  do  tomorrow?  The  answer  came:  The  most  good 
possible  in  the  shortest  period  of  time.  That  was  satisfying,  as  well — conjoining 
an  ambitious  aim  with  the  demands  of  maximal  efficiency.  A  worthy  challenge. 
The  second  question  was  in  the  same  vein:  What  shall  I  do  next  year?  Try  to 
ensure  that  the  good  I  do  then  will  be  exceeded  only  by  the  good  I  do  the  year 
after  that.  That  seemed  solid,  too — a  nice  extension  of  the  ambitions  detailed  in 


the  previous  answer.  I  told  my  friend  that  I  was  trying  a  serious  experiment  in 
writing  with  the  pen  he  had  given  to  me.  I  asked  if  I  could  read  aloud  what  I  had 
composed  so  far.  The  questions — and  the  answers — struck  a  chord  with  him,  too. 
That  was  good.  That  was  impetus  to  continue. 

The  next  question  ended  the  first  set:  What  shall  I  do  with  my  life?  Aim  for 
Paradise,  and  concentrate  on  today.  Hah!  I  knew  what  that  meant.  It’s  what 
Geppetto  does  in  the  Disney  movie  Pinocchio,  when  he  wishes  upon  a  star.  The 
grandfatherly  woodcarver  lifts  up  his  eyes  to  the  twinkling  diamond  set  high 
above  the  mundane  world  of  day-to-day  human  concerns  and  articulates  his 
deepest  desire:  that  the  marionette  he  created  lose  the  strings  by  which  he  is 
manipulated  by  others  and  transform  himself  into  a  real  boy.  It’s  also  the  central 
message  of  the  Sermon  on  the  Mount,  as  we  saw  in  Rule  4  (Compare  yourself  to 
who  you  were  yesterday  . . .),  but  which  deserve  repeating  here: 

And  why  take  ye  thought  for  raiment?  Consider  the  lilies  of  the  field,  how  they  grow;  they  toil 
not,  neither  do  they  spin:  And  yet  I  say  unto  you,  That  even  Solomon  in  all  his  glory  was  not 
arrayed  like  one  of  these.  Wherefore,  if  God  so  clothe  the  grass  of  the  field,  which  to  day  is,  and 
to  morrow  is  cast  into  the  oven,  shall  he  not  much  more  clothe  you,  O  ye  of  little  faith? 

Therefore  take  no  thought,  saying,  What  shall  we  eat?  or,  What  shall  we  drink?  or,  Wherewithal 
shall  we  be  clothed?  For  your  heavenly  Father  knoweth  that  ye  have  need  of  all  these  things. 

But  seek  ye  first  the  kingdom  of  God,  and  his  righteousness;  and  all  these  things  shall  be  added 
unto  you  (Matthew  6:28-6:33). 

What  does  all  that  mean?  Orient  yourself  properly.  Then — and  only  then — 
concentrate  on  the  day.  Set  your  sights  at  the  Good,  the  Beautiful,  and  the  True, 
and  then  focus  pointedly  and  carefully  on  the  concerns  of  each  moment.  Aim 
continually  at  Heaven  while  you  work  diligently  on  Earth.  Attend  fully  to  the 
future,  in  that  manner,  while  attending  fully  to  the  present.  Then  you  have  the 
best  chance  of  perfecting  both. 

I  turned,  then,  from  the  use  of  time  to  my  relationships  with  people,  and  wrote 
down  and  then  read  these  questions  and  answers  to  my  friend:  What  shall  I  do 
with  my  wife?  Treat  her  as  if  she  is  the  Holy  Mother  of  God,  so  that  she  may  give 
birth  to  the  world-redeeming  hero.  What  shall  I  do  with  my  daughter?  Stand 
behind  her,  listen  to  her,  guard  her,  train  her  mind,  and  let  her  know  it’s  OK  if 
she  wants  to  be  a  mother.  What  shall  I  do  with  my  parents?  Act  such  that  your 
actions  justify  the  suffering  they  endured.  What  shall  I  do  with  my  son  ? 
Encourage  him  to  be  a  true  Son  of  God. 

To  honour  your  wife  as  a  Mother  of  God  is  to  notice  and  support  the  sacred 
element  of  her  role  as  mother  (not  just  of  your  children,  but  as  such).  A  society 
that  forgets  this  cannot  survive.  Hitler’s  mother  gave  birth  to  Hitler,  and  Stalin’s 
mother  to  Stalin.  Was  something  amiss  in  their  crucial  relationships?  It  seems 
likely,  given  the  importance  of  the  maternal  role  in  establishing  trust  — to  take 


a  single  vital  example.  Perhaps  the  importance  of  their  motherly  duties,  and  of 
their  relationship  with  their  children,  was  not  properly  stressed;  perhaps  what  the 
women  were  doing  in  their  maternal  guise  was  not  properly  regarded  by 
husband,  father  and  society  alike.  Who  instead  might  a  woman  produce  if  she 
was  treated  properly,  honourably  and  carefully?  After  all,  the  fate  of  the  world 
rests  on  each  new  infant — tiny,  fragile  and  threatened  but,  in  time,  capable  of 
uttering  the  words  and  doing  the  deeds  that  maintain  the  eternal,  delicate  balance 
between  chaos  and  order. 

To  stand  behind  my  daughter?  That’s  to  encourage  her,  in  everything  she 
wants  courageously  to  do,  but  to  include  in  that  genuine  appreciation  for  the  fact 
of  her  femininity:  to  recognize  the  importance  of  having  a  family  and  children 
and  to  forego  the  temptation  to  denigrate  or  devalue  that  in  comparison  to 
accomplishment  of  personal  ambition  or  career.  It’s  not  for  nothing  that  the  Holy 
Mother  and  Infant  is  a  divine  image — as  we  just  discussed.  Societies  that  cease 
to  honour  that  image — that  cease  to  see  that  relationship  as  of  transcendent  and 
fundamental  importance — also  cease  to  be. 

To  act  to  justify  the  suffering  of  your  parents  is  to  remember  all  the  sacrifices 
that  all  the  others  who  lived  before  you  (not  least  your  parents)  have  made  for 
you  in  all  the  course  of  the  terrible  past,  to  be  grateful  for  all  the  progress  that 
has  been  thereby  made,  and  then  to  act  in  accordance  with  that  remembrance  and 
gratitude.  People  sacrificed  immensely  to  bring  about  what  we  have  now.  In 
many  cases,  they  literally  died  for  it — and  we  should  act  with  some  respect  for 
that  fact. 

To  encourage  my  son  to  be  a  true  Son  of  God  ?  That  is  to  want  him  above  all 
to  do  what  is  right,  and  to  strive  to  have  his  back  while  he  is  doing  so.  That  is,  I 
think,  part  of  the  sacrificial  message:  to  value  and  support  your  son’s 
commitment  to  transcendent  good  above  all  things  (including  his  worldly 
progress,  so  to  speak,  and  his  safety — and,  perhaps,  even  his  life). 

I  continued  asking  questions.  The  answers  came  within  seconds.  What  shall  I 
do  with  the  stranger?  Invite  him  into  my  house,  and  treat  him  like  a  brother,  so 
that  he  may  become  one.  That’s  to  extend  the  hand  of  trust  to  someone  so  that 
his  or  her  best  part  can  step  forward  and  reciprocate.  That’s  to  manifest  the 
sacred  hospitality  that  makes  life  between  those  who  do  not  yet  know  each  other 
possible.  What  shall  I  do  with  a  fallen  soul?  Offer  a  genuine  and  cautious  hand, 
but  do  not  join  it  in  the  mire.  That’s  a  good  summary  of  what  we  covered  in  Rule 
3  (Make  friends  with  people  who  want  the  best  for  you).  That’s  an  injunction  to 
refrain  both  from  casting  pearls  before  swine,  and  from  camouflaging  your  vice 
with  virtue.  What  shall  I  do  with  the  world?  Conduct  myself  as  if  Being  is  more 
valuable  than  Non-Being.  Act  so  that  you  are  not  made  bitter  and  corrupt  by  the 


tragedy  of  existence.  That’s  the  essence  of  Rule  1  (Stand  up  straight  with  your 
shoulders  back):  confront  the  uncertainty  of  the  world  voluntarily,  and  with  faith 
and  courage. 

How  shall  I  educate  my  people?  Share  with  them  those  things  I  regard  as  truly 
important.  That’s  Rule  8  (Tell  the  truth — or,  at  least,  don’t  lie).  That  is  to  aim  for 
wisdom,  to  distill  that  wisdom  into  words,  and  to  speak  forth  those  words  as  if 
they  matter,  with  true  concern  and  care.  That’s  all  relevant,  as  well,  to  the  next 
question  (and  answer):  What  shall  I  do  with  a  torn  nation?  Stitch  it  back  together 
with  careful  words  of  truth.  The  importance  of  this  injunction  has,  if  anything, 
become  clearer  over  the  past  few  years:  we  are  dividing,  and  polarizing,  and 
drifting  toward  chaos.  It  is  necessary,  under  such  conditions,  if  we  are  to  avoid 
catastrophe,  for  each  of  us  to  bring  forward  the  truth,  as  we  see  it:  not  the 
arguments  that  justify  our  ideologies,  not  the  machinations  that  further  our 
ambitions,  but  the  stark  pure  facts  of  our  existence,  revealed  for  others  to  see  and 
contemplate,  so  that  we  can  find  common  ground  and  proceed  together. 

What  shall  I  do  for  God  my  Father?  Sacrifice  everything  I  hold  dear  to  yet 
greater  perfection.  Let  the  deadwood  burn  off,  so  that  new  growth  can  prevail. 
That’s  the  terrible  lesson  of  Cain  and  Abel,  detailed  in  the  discussion  of  meaning 
surrounding  Rule  7.  What  shall  I  do  with  a  lying  man?  Let  him  speak  so  that  he 
may  reveal  himself.  Rule  9  (Listen  ...)  is  once  again  relevant  here,  as  is  another 
section  of  the  New  Testament: 

Ye  shall  know  them  by  their  fruits.  Do  men  gather  grapes  of  thorns,  or  figs  of  thistles?  Even  so 
every  good  tree  bringeth  forth  good  fruit;  but  a  corrupt  tree  bringeth  forth  evil  fruit.  A  good  tree 
cannot  bring  forth  evil  fruit,  neither  can  a  corrupt  tree  bring  forth  good  fruit.  Every  tree  that 
bringeth  not  forth  good  fruit  is  hewn  down,  and  cast  into  the  fire.  Wherefore  by  their  fruits  ye 
shall  know  them  (Matthew  7:16-7:20). 

The  rot  must  be  revealed  before  something  sound  can  be  put  in  its  place,  as  was 
also  indicated  in  Rule  7’s  elaboration — and  all  of  this  is  pertinent  to 
understanding  the  following  question  and  answer:  How  shall  I  deal  with  the 
enlightened  one?  Replace  him  with  the  true  seeker  of  enlightenment.  There  is  no 
enlightened  one.  There  is  only  the  one  who  is  seeking  further  enlightenment. 
Proper  Being  is  process,  not  a  state;  a  journey,  not  a  destination.  It’s  the 
continual  transformation  of  what  you  know,  through  encounter  with  what  you 
don’t  know,  rather  than  the  desperate  clinging  to  the  certainty  that  is  eternally 
insufficient  in  any  case.  That  accounts  for  the  importance  of  Rule  4  (Compare 
yourself  ...).  Always  place  your  becoming  above  your  current  being.  That  means 
it  is  necessary  to  recognize  and  accept  your  insufficiency,  so  that  it  can  be 
continually  rectified.  That’s  painful,  certainly — but  it’s  a  good  deal. 


The  next  few  Q  &  A’s  made  another  coherent  group,  focused  this  time  on 
ingratitude:  What  shall  I  do  when  I  despise  what  I  have?  Remember  those  who 
have  nothing  and  strive  to  be  grateful.  Take  stock  of  what  is  right  in  front  of  you 
Consider  Rule  12 — somewhat  tongue-in-cheek — (Pet  a  cat  when  you  encounter 
one  on  the  street).  Consider,  as  well,  that  you  may  be  blocked  in  your  progress 
not  because  you  lack  opportunity,  but  because  you  have  been  too  arrogant  to 
make  full  use  of  what  already  lies  in  front  of  you.  That’s  Rule  6  (Set  your  house 
in  perfect  order  before  you  criticize  the  world). 

I  spoke  recently  with  a  young  man  about  such  things.  He  had  barely  ever  left 
his  family  and  never  his  home  state — but  he  journeyed  to  Toronto  to  attend  one 
of  my  lectures  and  to  meet  with  me  at  my  home.  He  had  isolated  himself  far  too 
severely  in  the  short  course  of  his  life  to  date  and  was  badly  plagued  by  anxiety. 
When  we  first  met,  he  could  hardly  speak.  He  had  nonetheless  determined  in  the 
last  year  to  do  something  about  all  of  that.  He  started  by  taking  on  the  lowly  job 
of  dishwasher.  He  decided  to  do  it  well,  when  he  could  have  treated  it 
contemptuously.  Intelligent  enough  to  be  embittered  by  a  world  that  did  not 
recognize  his  gifts,  he  decided  instead  to  accept  with  the  genuine  humility  that  is 
the  true  precursor  to  wisdom  whatever  opportunity  he  could  find.  Now  he  lives 
on  his  own.  That’s  better  than  living  at  home.  Now  he  has  some  money.  Not 
much.  But  more  than  none.  And  he  earned  it.  Now  he  is  confronting  the  social 
world,  and  benefitting  from  the  ensuing  conflict: 

Knowledge  frequently  results 
from  knowing  others, 
but  the  man  who  is  awakened, 
has  seen  the  uncarved  block. 

Others  might  be  mastered  by  force, 
but  to  master  one ’s  self 
requires  the  Tao. 

He  who  has  many  material  things, 

may  be  described  as  rich, 

but  he  who  knows  he  has  enough, 

and  is  at  one  with  the  Tao, 

might  have  enough  of  material  things 

11  O 

and  have  self-being  as  well. 

As  long  as  my  still-anxious  but  self-transforming  and  determined  visitor 
continues  down  his  current  path,  he  will  become  far  more  competent  and 
accomplished,  and  it  won’t  take  long.  But  this  will  only  be  because  he  accepted 
his  lowly  state  and  was  sufficiently  grateful  to  take  the  first  equally  lowly  step 
away  from  it.  That’s  far  preferable  to  waiting,  endlessly,  for  the  magical  arrival 
of  Godot.  That’s  far  preferable  to  arrogant,  static,  unchanging  existence,  while 
the  demons  of  rage,  resentment  and  unlived  life  gather  around. 


What  shall  I  do  when  greed  consumes  me?  Remember  that  it  is  truly  better  to 
give  than  to  receive.  The  world  is  a  forum  of  sharing  and  trading  (that’s  Rule  7, 
again),  not  a  treasure-house  for  the  plundering.  To  give  is  to  do  what  you  can  to 
make  things  better.  The  good  in  people  will  respond  to  that,  and  support  it,  and 
imitate  it,  and  multiply  it,  and  return  it,  and  foster  it,  so  that  everything  improves 
and  moves  forward. 

What  shall  I  do  when  I  ruin  my  rivers?  Seek  for  the  living  water  and  let  it 
cleanse  the  Earth.  I  found  this  question,  as  well  as  its  answer,  particularly 
unexpected.  It  seems  most  associated  with  Rule  6  (Set  your  house  . . .).  Perhaps 
our  environmental  problems  are  not  best  construed  technically.  Maybe  they’re 
best  considered  psychologically.  The  more  people  sort  themselves  out,  the  more 
responsibility  they  will  take  for  the  world  around  them  and  the  more  problems 
they  will  solve.  It  is  better,  proverbially,  to  rule  your  own  spirit  than  to  rule  a 
city.  It’s  easier  to  subdue  an  enemy  without  than  one  within.  Maybe  the 
environmental  problem  is  ultimately  spiritual.  If  we  put  ourselves  in  order, 
perhaps  we  will  do  the  same  for  the  world.  Of  course,  what  else  would  a 
psychologist  think? 

The  next  set  were  associated  with  proper  response  to  crisis  and  exhaustion: 

What  shall  I  do  when  my  enemy  succeeds?  Aim  a  little  higher  and  be  grateful 
for  the  lesson.  Back  to  Matthew:  “Ye  have  heard  that  it  hath  been  said,  Thou 
shalt  love  thy  neighbour,  and  hate  thine  enemy.  But  I  say  unto  you,  Love  your 
enemies,  bless  them  that  curse  you,  do  good  to  them  that  hate  you,  and  pray  for 
them  which  despitefully  use  you,  and  persecute  you;  That  ye  may  be  the  children 
of  your  Father  which  is  in  heaven”  (5:43-5:45).  What  does  this  mean?  Learn, 
from  the  success  of  your  enemies;  listen  (Rule  9)  to  their  critique,  so  that  you 
can  glean  from  their  opposition  whatever  fragments  of  wisdom  you  might 
incorporate,  to  your  betterment;  adopt  as  your  ambition  the  creation  of  a  world  in 
which  those  who  work  against  you  see  the  light  and  wake  up  and  succeed,  so 
that  the  better  at  which  you  are  aiming  can  encompass  them,  too. 

What  shall  I  do  when  I’m  tired  and  impatient?  Gratefully  accept  an 
outstretched  helping  hand.  This  is  something  with  a  twofold  meaning.  It’s  an 
injunction,  first,  to  note  the  reality  of  the  limitations  of  individual  being  and, 
second,  to  accept  and  be  thankful  for  the  support  of  others — family,  friends, 
acquaintances  and  strangers  alike.  Exhaustion  and  impatience  are  inevitable. 
There  is  too  much  to  be  done  and  too  little  time  in  which  to  do  it.  But  we  don’t 
have  to  strive  alone,  and  there  is  nothing  but  good  in  distributing  the 
responsibilities,  cooperating  in  the  efforts,  and  sharing  credit  for  the  productive 
and  meaningful  work  thereby  undertaken. 

What  shall  I  do  with  the  fact  of  aging?  Replace  the  potential  of  my  youth  with 


the  accomplishments  of  my  maturity.  This  hearkens  back  to  the  discussion  of 
friendship  surrounding  Rule  3,  and  the  story  of  Socrates’  trial  and  death — which 
might  be  summarized,  as  follows:  A  life  lived  thoroughly  justifies  its  own 
limitations.  The  young  man  with  nothing  has  his  possibilities  to  set  against  the 
accomplishments  of  his  elders.  It’s  not  clear  that  it’s  necessarily  a  bad  deal,  for 
either.  “An  aged  man  is  but  a  paltry  thing,”  wrote  William  Butler  Yeats,  “A 
tattered  coat  upon  a  stick,  unless/Soul  clap  its  hands  and  sing,  and  louder 
sing/For  every  tatter  in  its  mortal  dress  . .  ..”220 

What  shall  I  do  with  my  infant’s  death?  Hold  my  other  loved  ones  and  heal 
their  pain.  It  is  necessary  to  be  strong  in  the  face  of  death,  because  death  is 
intrinsic  to  life.  It  is  for  this  reason  that  I  tell  my  students:  aim  to  be  the  person  at 
your  father’s  funeral  that  everyone,  in  their  grief  and  misery,  can  rely  on.  There’s 
a  worthy  and  noble  ambition:  strength  in  the  face  of  adversity.  That  is  very 
different  from  the  wish  for  a  life  free  of  trouble. 

What  shall  I  do  in  the  next  dire  moment?  Focus  my  attention  on  the  next  right 
move.  The  flood  is  coming.  The  flood  is  always  coming.  The  apocalypse  is 
always  upon  us.  That’s  why  the  story  of  Noah  is  archetypal.  Things  fall  apart — 
we  stressed  that  in  the  discussion  surrounding  Rule  10  (Be  precise  in  your 
speech) — and  the  centre  cannot  hold.  When  everything  has  become  chaotic  and 
uncertain,  all  that  remains  to  guide  you  might  be  the  character  you  constructed, 
previously,  by  aiming  up  and  concentrating  on  the  moment  at  hand.  If  you  have 
failed  in  that,  you  will  fail  in  the  moment  of  crisis,  and  then  God  help  you. 

That  last  set  contained  what  I  thought  were  the  most  difficult  of  all  the 
questions  I  asked  that  night.  The  death  of  a  child  is,  perhaps,  the  worst  of 
catastrophes.  Many  relationships  fail  in  the  aftermath  of  such  a  tragedy.  But 
dissolution  in  the  face  of  such  horror  is  not  inevitable,  although  it  is 
understandable.  I  have  seen  people  immensely  strengthen  their  remaining  family 
bonds  when  someone  close  to  them  has  died.  I  have  seen  them  turn  to  those  who 
remained  and  redouble  their  efforts  to  connect  with  them  and  support  them. 
Because  of  that,  all  regained  at  least  some  of  what  had  been  so  terribly  torn  away 
by  death.  We  must  therefore  commiserate  in  our  grief.  We  must  come  together  in 
the  face  of  the  tragedy  of  existence.  Our  families  can  be  the  living  room  with  the 
fireplace  that  is  cozy  and  welcoming  and  warm  while  the  storms  of  winter  rage 
outside. 

The  heightened  knowledge  of  fragility  and  mortality  produced  by  death  can 
terrify,  embitter  and  separate.  It  can  also  awaken.  It  can  remind  those  who  grieve 
not  to  take  the  people  who  love  them  for  granted.  Once  I  did  some  chilling 
calculations  regarding  my  parents,  who  are  in  their  eighties.  It  was  an  example 
of  the  hated  arithmetic  we  encountered  in  the  discussion  of  Rule  5  (Do  not  let 


your  children  do  anything  that  makes  you  dislike  them) — and  I  walked  through 
the  equations  so  that  I  would  stay  properly  conscious.  I  see  my  Mom  and  Dad 
about  twice  a  year.  We  generally  spend  several  weeks  together.  We  talk  on  the 
phone  in  the  interim  between  visits.  But  the  life  expectancy  of  people  in  their 
eighties  is  under  ten  years.  That  means  I  am  likely  to  see  my  parents,  if  I  am 
fortunate,  fewer  than  twenty  more  times.  That’s  a  terrible  thing  to  know.  But 
knowing  it  puts  a  stop  to  my  taking  those  opportunities  for  granted. 

The  next  set  of  questions — and  answers — had  to  do  with  the  development  of 
character.  What  shall  I  say  to  a  faithless  brother?  The  King  of  the  Damned  is  a 
poor  judge  of  Being.  It  is  my  firm  belief  that  the  best  way  to  fix  the  world — a 
handyman’s  dream,  if  ever  there  was  one — is  to  fix  yourself,  as  we  discussed  in 
Rule  6.  Anything  else  is  presumptuous.  Anything  else  risks  harm,  stemming 
from  your  ignorance  and  lack  of  skill.  But  that’s  OK.  There’s  plenty  to  do,  right 
where  you  are.  After  all,  your  specific  personal  faults  detrimentally  affect  the 
world.  Your  conscious,  voluntary  sins  (because  no  other  word  really  works) 
makes  things  worse  than  they  have  to  be.  Your  inaction,  inertia  and  cynicism 
removes  from  the  world  that  part  of  you  that  could  learn  to  quell  suffering  and 
make  peace.  That’s  not  good.  There  are  endless  reasons  to  despair  of  the  world, 
and  to  become  angry  and  resentful  and  to  seek  revenge. 

Failure  to  make  the  proper  sacrifices,  failure  to  reveal  yourself,  failure  to  live 
and  tell  the  truth — all  that  weakens  you.  In  that  weakened  state,  you  will  be 
unable  to  thrive  in  the  world,  and  you  will  be  of  no  benefit  to  yourself  or  to 
others.  You  will  fail  and  suffer,  stupidly.  That  will  corrupt  your  soul.  How  could 
it  be  otherwise?  Life  is  hard  enough  when  it  is  going  well.  But  when  it’s  going 
badly?  And  I  have  learned  through  painful  experience  that  nothing  is  going  so 
badly  that  it  can’t  be  made  worse.  This  is  why  Hell  is  a  bottomless  pit.  This  is 
why  Hell  is  associated  with  that  aforementioned  sin.  In  the  most  awful  of  cases, 
the  terrible  suffering  of  unfortunate  souls  becomes  attributable,  by  their  own 
judgment,  to  mistakes  they  made  knowingly  in  the  past:  acts  of  betrayal, 
deception,  cruelty,  carelessness,  cowardice  and,  most  commonly  of  all,  willful 
blindness.  To  suffer  terribly  and  to  know  yourself  as  the  cause:  that  is  Hell.  And 
once  in  Hell  it  is  very  easy  to  curse  Being  itself.  And  no  wonder.  But  it’s  not 
justifiable.  And  that’s  why  the  King  of  the  Damned  is  a  poor  judge  of  Being. 

How  do  you  build  yourself  into  someone  on  whom  you  can  rely,  in  the  best  of 
times  and  the  worst — in  peace  and  in  war?  How  do  you  build  for  yourself  the 
kind  of  character  that  will  not  ally  itself,  in  its  suffering  and  misery,  with  all  who 
dwell  in  Hell?  The  questions  and  answers  continued,  all  pertinent,  in  one  way  or 
another,  to  the  rules  I  have  outlined  in  this  book: 


What  shall  I  do  to  strengthen  my  spirit?  Do  not  tell  lies,  or  do  what  you 
despise. 

What  shall  I  do  to  ennoble  my  body?  Use  it  only  in  the  service  of  my  soul. 

What  shall  I  do  with  the  most  difficult  of  questions?  Consider  them  the 
gateway  to  the  path  of  life. 

What  shall  I  do  with  the  poor  man’s  plight?  Strive  through  right  example  to  lift 
his  broken  heart. 

What  shall  I  do  when  the  great  crowd  beckons?  Stand  tall  and  utter  my  broken 
truths. 

And  that  was  that.  I  still  have  my  Pen  of  Light.  I  haven’t  written  anything  with 
it  since.  Maybe  I  will  again  when  the  mood  strikes  and  something  wells  up  from 
deep  below.  But,  even  if  I  don’t,  it  helped  me  find  the  words  to  properly  close 
this  book. 

I  hope  that  my  writing  has  proved  useful  to  you.  I  hope  it  revealed  things  you 
knew  that  you  did  not  know  you  knew.  I  hope  the  ancient  wisdom  I  discussed 
provides  you  with  strength.  I  hope  it  brightened  the  spark  within  you.  I  hope  you 
can  straighten  up,  sort  out  your  family,  and  bring  peace  and  prosperity  to  your 
community.  I  hope,  in  accordance  with  Rule  11  (Do  not  bother  children  when 
they  are  skateboarding),  that  you  strengthen  and  encourage  those  who  are 
committed  to  your  care  instead  of  protecting  them  to  the  point  of  weakness. 

I  wish  you  all  the  best,  and  hope  that  you  can  wish  the  best  for  others. 

What  will  you  write  with  your  pen  of  light?

passes  not  through  states,  nor  between  classes,  nor  between  political  parties 
either — but  right  through  every  human  heart — and  through  all  human 
hearts.  This  line  shifts.  Inside  us,  it  oscillates  with  the  years.  And  even 
within  hearts  overwhelmed  by  evil,  one  small  bridgehead  of  good  is 
retained.  And  even  in  the  best  of  all  hearts,  there  remains  ...  an  unuprooted 
small  corner  of  evil.  Since  then  I  have  come  to  understand  the  truth  of  all 
the  religions  of  the  world:  They  struggle  with  the  evil  inside  a  human  being 
(inside  every  human  being).  It  is  impossible  to  expel  evil  from  the  world  in 
its  entirety,  but  it  is  possible  to  constrict  it  within  each  person.”

shame,  the  devouring  mother  and  the  tyrannical  father.

grace  are  ye  saved  through  faith;  and  that  not  of  yourselves:  it  is  the  gift  of 
God:  Not  of  works,  lest  any  man  should  boast.  A  similar  sentiment  is 
echoed  in  Romans  9:15-9:16:  I  will  have  mercy  on  whom  I  will  have 
mercy,  and  I  will  have  compassion  on  whom  I  will  have  compassion.  So 
then  it  is  not  of  him  that  willeth,  nor  of  him  that  runneth,  but  of  God  that 
sheweth  mercy.  The  New  International  Version  restates  9:16  this  way:  It 
does  not,  therefore,  depend  on  human  desire  or  effort,  but  on  God’s  mercy.

Acknowledgements 


I  lived  through  a  tumultuous  time  when  I  was  writing  this  book,  to  say  the  least. 

I  had  more  than  my  fair  share  of  reliable,  competent,  trustworthy  people  standing 
with  me,  however,  and  thank  God  for  that.  I  would  particularly  like  to  thank  my 
wife,  Tammy,  my  great  and  good  friend  for  almost  fifty  years.  She  has  been  an 
absolute  pillar  of  honesty,  stability,  support,  practical  help,  organization  and 
patience  during  the  years  of  writing  that  continued  during  anything  and 
everything  else  that  has  happened  in  our  lives,  no  matter  how  pressing  or 
important.  My  daughter,  Mikhaila,  and  my  son,  Julian,  as  well  as  my  parents, 
Walter  and  Beverley,  were  also  right  there  beside  me,  paying  careful  attention, 
discussing  complicated  issues  with  me,  and  aiding  me  in  the  organization  of  my 
thoughts,  words  and  actions.  The  same  is  true  of  my  brother-in-law,  Jim  Keller, 
computer  chip  architect  extraordinaire,  and  my  always  reliable  and  adventurous 
sister,  Bonnie.  The  friendship  of  Wodek  Szemberg  and  Estera  Bekier  has  proved 
invaluable  to  me,  in  many  ways,  for  many  years,  as  has  the  behind-the-scenes 
and  subtle  support  of  Professor  William  Cunningham.  Dr.  Norman  Doidge  went 
beyond  the  call  of  duty  writing  and  revising  the  foreword  to  this  book,  which 
took  far  more  effort  than  I  had  originally  estimated,  and  the  friendship  and 
warmth  he  and  his  wife,  Karen,  continually  provide  has  been  very  much 
appreciated  by  my  entire  family.  It  was  a  pleasure  to  collaborate  with  Craig 
Pyette,  my  editor  at  Random  House  Canada.  Craig’s  careful  attention  to  detail 
and  ability  to  diplomatically  rein  in  excess  bursts  of  passion  (and  sometimes 
irritation)  in  my  many  drafts  made  for  a  much  more  measured  and  balanced 
book. 

Gregg  Hurwitz,  novelist,  screen-writer  and  friend,  used  many  of  my  rules  for 
life  in  his  bestseller  Orphan  X,  well  before  my  book  was  written,  which  was  a 
great  compliment  and  indicator  of  their  potential  value  and  public  appeal.  Gregg 
also  volunteered  as  a  dedicated,  thorough,  viciously  incisive  and  comically 
cynical  editor  and  commentator  while  I  was  writing  and  editing.  He  helped  me 
cut  unnecessary  verbiage  (some  of  it  at  least)  and  stay  on  the  narrative  track. 
Gregg  also  recommended  Ethan  van  Scriver,  who  provided  the  fine  illustrations 
that  begin  each  chapter,  and  I  would  like  to  acknowledge  him  for  that,  as  well  as 


tipping  my  hat  to  Ethan  himself,  whose  drawings  add  a  necessary  touch  of 
lightness,  whimsy  and  warmth  to  what  might  otherwise  have  been  a  too-dark  and 
dramatic  tome. 

Finally,  I  would  like  to  thank  Sally  Harding,  my  agent,  and  the  fine  people  she 
works  with  at  CookeMcDermid.  Without  Sally,  this  book  would  have  never  been 
written.

fnl  Some  argue — mistakenly — that  Freud  (often  mentioned  in  these  pages)  contributed  to  our 
current  longing  for  a  culture,  schools  and  institutions  that  are  “non-judgmental.”  It  is  true  that 
he  recommended  that  when  psychoanalysts  listen  to  their  patients  in  therapy,  they  be  tolerant, 
empathic,  and  not  voice  critical,  moralistic  judgments.  But  this  was  for  the  express  purposes 
of  helping  patients  feel  comfortable  in  being  totally  honest,  and  not  diminish  their  problems. 
This  encouraged  self-reflection,  and  allowed  them  to  explore  warded  off  feelings,  wishes, 
even  shameful  anti-social  urges.  It  also — and  this  was  the  masterstroke — allowed  them  to 
discover  their  own  unconscious  conscience  (and  its  judgments),  and  their  own  harsh  self- 
criticism  of  their  “lapses,”  and  their  own  unconscious  guilt  which  they  had  often  hidden  from 
themselves,  but  which  often  formed  the  basis  of  their  low  self-esteem,  depression  and  anxiety. 
If  anything,  Freud  showed  that  we  are  both  more  immoral  and  more  moral  than  we  are  aware 
of.  This  kind  of  “non-judgmentalism,”  in  therapy,  is  a  powerful  and  liberating  technique  or 
tactic — an  ideal  attitude  when  you  want  to  better  understand  yourself.  But  Freud  never  argued 
(as  do  some  who  want  all  culture  to  become  one  huge  group  therapy  session)  that  one  can  live 
one’s  entire  life  without  ever  making  judgments,  or  without  morality.  In  fact,  his  point  in 
Civilization  and  its  Discontents  is  that  civilization  only  arises  when  some  restraining  rules 
and  morality  are  in  place. 


CUBES 


fnl  The  yin/yang  symbol  is  the  second  part  of  the  more  comprehensive  five-part  tajitu,  a 
diagram  representing  both  the  original  absolute  unity  and  its  division  into  the  multiplicity  of 
the  observed  world.  This  is  discussed  in  more  detail  in  Rule  2,  below,  as  well  as  elsewhere  in 
the  book. 

I  use  the  term  Being  (with  a  capital  “B”)  in  part  because  of  my  exposure  to  the  ideas  of 
the  20th-century  German  philosopher  Martin  Heidegger.  Heidegger  tried  to  distinguish 
between  reality,  as  conceived  objectively,  and  the  totality  of  human  experience  (which  is  his 
“Being”).  Being  (with  a  capital  “B”)  is  what  each  of  us  experiences,  subjectively,  personally 
and  individually,  as  well  as  what  we  each  experience  jointly  with  others.  As  such,  it  includes 
emotions,  drives,  dreams,  visions  and  revelations,  as  well  as  our  private  thoughts  and 
perceptions.  Being  is  also,  finally,  something  that  is  brought  into  existence  by  action,  so  its 
nature  is  to  an  indeterminate  degree  a  consequence  of  our  decisions  and  choices — something 
shaped  by  our  hypothetically  free  will.  Construed  in  this  manner,  Being  is  (1)  not  something 
easily  and  directly  reducible  to  the  material  and  objective  and  (2)  something  that  most 
definitely  requires  its  own  term,  as  Heidegger  labored  for  decades  to  indicate. 


RULE  2:  TREAT  YOURSELF  LIKE  SOMEONE  YOU  ARE  RESPONSIBLE  FOR  HELPING 


fill 


It  is  of  great  interest,  in  this  regard,  that  the  five-part  taijitu  (referred  to  in  Chapter  1  and 
the  source  of  the  simpler  yin/yang  symbol)  expresses  the  origin  of  the  cosmos  as,  first, 
originating  in  the  undifferentiated  absolute,  then  dividing  into  yin  and  yang  (chaos/order, 
feminine/masculine),  and  then  into  the  five  agents  (wood,  fire,  earth,  metal,  water)  and  then, 
simply  put,  “the  ten  thousand  things.”  The  Star  of  David  (chaos/order,  feminine/masculine) 
gives  rise  in  the  same  way  to  the  four  basic  elements:  fire,  air,  water  and  earth  (out  of  which 
everything  else  is  built).  A  similar  hexagram  is  used  by  the  Hindus.  The  downward  triangle 
symbolizes  Shakti,  the  feminine;  the  upward  triangle,  Shiva,  the  masculine.  The  two 
components  are  known  as  om  and  hrim  in  Sanskrit.  Remarkable  examples  of  conceptual 
parallelism. 

Or,  in  another  interpretation,  He  split  the  original  androgynous  individual  into  two  parts, 
male  and  female.  According  to  this  line  of  thinking,  Christ,  the  “second  Adam,”  is  also  the 
original  Man,  before  the  sexual  subdivision.  The  symbolic  meaning  of  this  should  be  clear  to 
those  who  have  followed  the  argument  thus  far. 


RULE  5:  DO  NOT  LET  YOUR  CHILDREN  DO  ANYTHING  THAT  MAKES  YOU  DISLIKE 


fnl  I  draw  here  and  will  many  times  again  in  the  course  of  this  book  on  my  clinical 
experience  (as  I  have,  already,  on  my  personal  history).  I  have  tried  to  keep  the  moral  of  the 
stories  intact,  while  disguising  the  details  for  the  sake  of  the  privacy  of  those  involved.  I  hope 
I  got  the  balance  right. 


RULE  7:  PURSUE  WHAT  IS  MEANINGFUL  (NOT  WHAT  IS  EXPEDIENT) 


fnl  And  this  is  all  true,  note,  whether  there  is — or  is  not — actually  such  a  powerful  figure,  “in 
the  sky”  :) 

In  keeping  with  this  observation  is  the  fact  that  the  word  Set  is  an  etymological  precursor 
to  the  word  Satan.  See  Murdock,  D.M.  (2009).  Christ  in  Egypt:  the  Horus-Jesus  connection. 
Seattle,  WA:  Stellar  House,  p.  75. 

For  anyone  who  thinks  this  is  somehow  unrealistic,  given  the  concrete  material  reality 
and  genuine  suffering  that  is  associated  with  privation,  I  would  once  again  recommend 
Solzhenitsyn’s  Gulag  Archipelago,  which  contains  a  series  of  exceptionally  profound 
discussions  about  proper  ethical  behavior  and  its  exaggerated  rather  than  diminished 
importance  in  situations  of  extreme  want  and  suffering. 


RULE  9:  ASSUME  THAT  THE  PERSON  YOU  ARE  LISTENING  TO  MIGHT  KNOW| 
^^^^^^^^^^^■SOMETHING  YOU  DON’T 


fnl  Here,  again,  I  have  disguised  many  of  the  details  of  this  case,  to  maintain  the  privacy  of 
those  involved,  while  attempting  to  maintain  the  central  meaning  of  the  events. 

The  strategy  of  speaking  to  individuals  is  not  only  vital  to  the  delivery  of  any  message, 
it’s  a  useful  antidote  to  fear  of  public  speaking.  No  one  wants  to  be  stared  at  by  hundreds  of 
unfriendly,  judgmental  eyes.  However,  almost  everybody  can  talk  to  just  one  attentive  person. 
So,  if  you  have  to  deliver  a  speech  (another  terrible  phrase)  then  do  that.  Talk  to  the 
individuals  in  the  audience — and  don’t  hide:  not  behind  the  podium,  not  with  downcast  eyes, 
not  by  speaking  too  quietly  or  mumbling,  not  by  apologizing  for  your  lack  of  brilliance  or 
preparedness,  not  behind  ideas  that  are  not  yours,  and  not  behind  cliches. 


RULE  10:  BE  PRECISE  IN  YOUR  SPEECH 


fnl  This  is  why,  for  example,  it  has  taken  us  far  longer  than  we  originally  assumed  to  make 
robots  that  could  function  autonomously  in  the  world.  The  problem  of  perception  is  far  more 
difficult  than  our  immediate  effortless  access  to  our  own  perceptions  predisposes  us  to  infer. 
In  fact,  the  problem  of  perception  is  so  difficult  that  it  stalled  the  early  progress  of  artificial 
intelligence  almost  fatally  (from  the  perspective  of  that  time),  as  we  discovered  that 
disembodied  abstract  reason  could  not  solve  even  simple  real-world  problems.  Pioneers  such 
as  Rodney  Brooks  proposed  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  ’90s  that  bodies  in  action  were 
necessary  preconditions  to  the  parsing  of  the  world  into  manageable  things,  and  the  AI 
revolution  regained  its  confidence  and  momentum. 


RULE  11:  DO  NOT  BOTHER  CHILDREN  WHEN  THEY  ARE  SKATEBOARDING

(Matthew 13:35) 



Preface 

DESCENSUS AD INFEROS 

Something we cannot see protects us from something we do not 
understand. The thing we cannot see is culture, in its intrapsychic or 
internal manifestation. The thing we do not understand is the chaos that 
gave rise to culture. If the structure of culture is disrupted, unwittingly, 
chaos returns. We will do anything-anything-to defend ourselves against 
that return. 

“The very fact that a general problem has gripped and assimilated 
the whole of a person is a guarantee that the speaker has really 
experienced it, and perhaps gained something from his 
sufferings. He will then reflect the problem for us in his 
personal life and thereby show us a truth.” 

I was raised under the protective auspices, so to speak, of the Christian church. This does 
not mean that my family was explicitly religious. I attended conservative Protestant 
services during childhood with my mother, but she was not a dogmatic or authoritarian 
believer, and we never discussed religious issues at home. My father appeared essentially 
agnostic, at least in the traditional sense. He refused to even set foot in a church, except 
during weddings and funerals. Nonetheless, the historical remnants of Christian morality 
permeated our household, conditioning our expectations and interpersonal responses, in 
the most intimate of manners. When I grew up, after all, most people still attended 
church; furthermore, all the rules and expectations that made up middle-class society 
were Judeo-Christian in nature. Even the increasing number of those who could not 
tolerate formal ritual and belief still implicitly accepted—still acted out—the rules that 
made up the Christian game. 

When I was twelve or so my mother enrolled me in confirmation classes, which served 
as introduction to adult membership in the church. I did not like attending. I did not like 
the attitude of my overtly religious classmates (who were few in number) and did not 
desire their lack of social standing. I did not like the school-like atmosphere of the 
confirmation classes. More importantly, however, I could not swallow what I was being 
taught. I asked the minister, at one point, how he reconciled the story of Genesis with the 
creation theories of modern science. He had not undertaken such a reconciliation; 
furthermore, he seemed more convinced, in his heart, of the evolutionary viewpoint. I 
was looking for an excuse to leave, anyway, and that was the last straw. Religion was for 
the ignorant, weak and superstitious. I stopped attending church and joined the modern 
world. 

Although I had grown up in a Christian environment—and had a successful and happy 
childhood, in at least partial consequence—I was more than willing to throw aside the 
structure that had fostered me. No one really opposed my rebellious efforts, either, in 



church or at home—in part because those who were deeply religious (or who might have 
wanted to be) had no intellectually acceptable counter-arguments at their disposal. After 
all, many of the basic tenets of Christian belief were incomprehensible, if not clearly 
absurd. The virgin birth was an impossibility; likewise, the notion that someone could 
rise from the dead. 

Did my act of rebellion precipitate a familial or a social crisis? No. My actions were so 
predictable, in a sense, that they upset no one, with the exception of my mother (and even 
she was soon resigned to the inevitable). The other members of the church—my 
“community”—had become absolutely habituated to the increasingly more frequent act 
of defection, and did not even notice. 

Did my act of rebellion upset me, personally? Only in a manner I was not able to 
perceive, until many years later. I developed a premature concern with large-scale 
political and social issues, at about the same time I quit attending church. Why were 
some countries, some people, rich, happy and successful, while others were doomed to 
misery? Why were the forces of NATO and the Soviet Union continually at each other’s 
throats? How was it possible for people to act the way the Nazis had during World War 
II? Underlying these specific considerations was a broader, but at the time ill- 
conceptualized question: how did evil—particularly group-fostered evil—come to play 
its role in the world? 

I abandoned the traditions that supported me, at about the same time I left childhood. 
This meant that I had no broader socially constructed “philosophy” at hand to aid my 
understanding as I became aware of the existential problems that accompany maturity. 
The final consequences of that lack took years to become hilly manifest. In the meantime, 
however, my nascent concern with questions of moral justice found immediate 
resolution. I started working as a volunteer for a mildly socialist political party, and 
adopted the party line. 

Economic injustice was at the root of all evil, as far as I was concerned. Such injustice 
could be rectified, as a consequence of the rearrangement of social organizations. I could 
play a part in that admirable revolution, carrying out my ideological beliefs. Doubt 
vanished; my role was clear. Looking back, I am amazed at how stereotypical my 
actions—reactions—really were. I could not rationally accept the premises of religion as 
I understood them. I turned, in consequence, to dreams of political utopia, and personal 
power. The same ideological trap caught millions of others, in recent centuries. 

When I was seventeen I left the town I grew up in. I moved nearby and attended a 
small college, which offered the first two years of undergraduate education. I involved 
myself there in university politics—which were more or less left wing at that time—and 
was elected to the college board of governors. The board was composed of politically and 
ideologically conservative people: lawyers, doctors, and businessmen. They were all well 
(or at least practically) educated, pragmatic, confident, outspoken; they had all 
accomplished something worthwhile and difficult. I could not help but admire them, even 
though I did not share their political stance. I found the fact of my admiration unsettling. 

I had attended several left-wing party congresses, as a student politician and active 
party worker. I hoped to emulate the socialist leaders. The left had a long and honorable 
history in Canada, and attracted some truly competent and caring people. However, I 
could not generate much respect for the numerous low-level party activists I encountered 
at these meetings. They seemed to live to complain. They had no career, frequently, and 



no family, no completed education—nothing but ideology. They were peevish, irritable, 
and little, in every sense of the word. I was faced, in consequence, with the mirror image 
of the problem I encountered on the college board: I did not admire many of the 
individuals who believed the same things I did. This additional complication furthered 
my existential confusion. 

My college roommate, an insightful cynic, expressed skepticism regarding my 
ideological beliefs. He told me that the world could not be completely encapsulated 
within the boundaries of socialist philosophy. I had more or less come to this conclusion 
on my own, but had not admitted so much in words. Soon afterward, however, I read 
George Orwell’s Road to Wigan Pier. This book finally undermined me—not only my 
socialist ideology, but my faith in ideological stances themselves. In the famous essay 
concluding that book (written for—and much to the dismay of—the British Left Book 
Club) Orwell described the great flaw of socialism, and the reason for its frequent failure 
to attract and maintain democratic power (at least in Britain). Orwell said, essentially, 
that socialists did not really like the poor. They merely hated the rich." His idea struck 
home instantly. Socialist ideology served to mask resentment and hatred, bred by failure. 
Many of the party activists I had encountered were using the ideals of social justice to 
rationalize their pursuit of personal revenge. 

Whose fault was it that I was poor or uneducated and unadmired? Obviously, the fault 
of the rich, well-schooled and respected. How convenient, then, that the demands of 
revenge and abstract justice dovetailed! It was only right to obtain recompense from 
those more fortunate than me. 

Of course, my socialist colleagues and I weren’t out to hurt anyone. Quite the reverse. 
We were out to improve things—but we were going to start with other people. I came to 
see the temptation in this logic, the obvious flaw, the danger—but could also see that it 
did not exclusively characterize socialism. Anyone who was out to change the world by 
changing others was to be regarded with suspicion. The temptations of such a position 
were too great to be resisted. 

It was not socialist ideology that posed the problem, then, but ideology as such. 
Ideology divided the world up simplistically into those who thought and acted properly, 
and those who did not. Ideology enabled the believer to hide from his own unpleasant and 
inadmissible fantasies and wishes. Such realizations upset my beliefs (even my faith in 
beliefs), and the plans I had formulated as a consequence of these beliefs. I could no 
longer tell who was good and who was bad, so to speak—so I no longer knew whom to 
support, or whom to fight. This state of affairs proved very troublesome, pragmatically as 
well as philosophically. I wanted to become a corporate lawyer—had written the Law 
School Admissions Test, had taken two years of appropriate preliminary courses. I 
wanted to learn the ways of my enemies, and embark on a political career. This plan 
disintegrated. The world obviously did not need another lawyer, and I no longer believed 
that I knew enough to masquerade as a leader. 

I became simultaneously disenchanted with the study of political science, my 
erstwhile major. I had adopted that discipline so I could learn more about the structure of 
human beliefs (and for the practical, career-oriented reasons described previously). It 
remained very interesting to me when I was at junior college, where I was introduced to 
the history of political philosophy. When I moved to the main campus at the University 
of Alberta, however, my interest disappeared. I was taught that people were motivated by 



rational forces; that human beliefs and actions were determined by economic pressures. 
This did not seem sufficient explanation. I could not believe (and still do not) that 
commodities—“natural resources,” for example—had intrinsic and self-evident value. In 
the absence of such value, the worth of things had to be socially or culturally (or even 
individually) determined. This act of determination appeared to me moral —appeared to 
me to be a consequence of the moral philosophy adopted by the society, culture or person 
in question. What people valued, economically, merely reflected what they believed to be 
important. This meant that real motivation had to lie in the domain of value, of morality. 
The political scientists I studied with did not see this, or did not think it was relevant. 

My religious convictions, ill-formed to begin with, disappeared when I was very 
young. My confidence in socialism (that is, in political utopia) vanished when I realized 
that the world was not merely a place of economics. My faith in ideology departed, when 
I began to see that ideological identification itself posed a profound and mysterious 
problem. I could not accept the theoretical explanations my chosen field of study had to 
offer, and no longer had any practical reasons to continue in my original direction. I 
finished my three-year bachelor’s degree, and left university. All my beliefs—which had 
lent order to the chaos of my existence, at least temporarily—had proved illusory; I could 
no longer see the sense in things. I was cast adrift; I did not know what to do or what to 
think. 

But what of others? Was there evidence anywhere that the problems I now faced had 
been solved, by anyone, in any acceptable manner? The customary behavior and attitudes 
of my friends and family members offered no solution. The people I knew well were no 
more resolutely goal-directed or satisfied than I was. Their beliefs and modes of being 
seemed merely to disguise frequent doubt and profound disquietude. More disturbingly, 
on the more gener-al plane, something truly insane was taking place. The great societies 
of the world were feverishly constructing a nuclear machine, with unimaginably 
destructive capabilities. Someone or something was making terrible plans. Why? 
Theoretically normal and well-adapted people were going about their business 
prosaically, as if nothing were the matter. Why weren’t they disturbed? Weren’t they 
paying attention? Wasn’t I? 

My concern with the general social and political insanity and evil of the world— 
sublimated by temporary infatuation with utopian socialism and political machination— 
returned with a vengeance. The mysterious fact of the Cold War increasingly occupied 
the forefront of my consciousness. How could things have come to such a point? 

History is just a madhouse 
it’s turned over all the stones 
and its very careful reading 
leaves you little that’s unknown 

I couldn’t understand the nuclear race: what could possibly be worth risking 
annihilation—not merely of the present, but of the past and the future? What could 
possibly justify the threat of total destruction? 

Bereft of solutions, I had at least been granted the gift of a problem. 

I returned to university and began to study psychology. I visited a maximum security 
prison on the outskirts of Edmonton, under the supervision of an eccentric adjunct 



professor at the University of Alberta. His primary job was the psychological care of 
convicts. The prison was foil of murderers, rapists and armed robbers. I ended up in the 
gym, near the weight room, on my first reconnaissance. I was wearing a long wool cape, 
circa 1890, which I had bought in Portugal, and a pair of tall leather boots. The 
psychologist who was accompanying me disappeared, unexpectedly, and left me alone. 
Soon I was surrounded by unfamiliar men, some of whom were extremely large and 
tough-looking. One in particular stands out in my memory. He was exceptionally 
muscular, and tattooed over his bare chest. He had a vicious scar running from his 
collarbone to his midsection. Maybe he had survived open-heart surgery. Or maybe it 
was an ax wound. The injury would have killed a lesser man, anyway—someone like me. 

Some of the prisoners, who weren’t dressed particularly well, offered to trade their 
clothes for mine. This did not strike me as a great bargain, but I wasn’t sure how to 
refuse. Fate rescued me, in the form of a short, skinny, bearded man. He said that the 
psychologist had sent him, and he asked me to accompany him. He was only one person, 
and many others (much larger) currently surrounded me and my cape. So I took him at 
his word. He led me outside the gym doors, and into the prison yard, talking quietly but 
reasonably about something innocuous (I don’t recall what) all the while. I kept glancing 
back hopefully at the open doors behind us as we got further and further away. Finally 
my supervisor appeared, and motioned me back. We left the bearded prisoner, and went 
to a private office. The psychologist told me that the harmless-appearing little man who 
had escorted me out of the gym had murdered two policemen after he had forced them to 
dig their own graves. One of the policemen had little children and had begged for his life 
on their behalf while he was digging—at least according to the murderer’s own 
testimony. 

This really shocked me. 

I had read about this sort of event, of course—but it had never been made real for me. 
I had never met someone even tangentially affected by something like this, and had 
certainly not encountered anyone who had actually done something so terrible. How 
could the man I had talked to—who was so apparently normal (and so seemingly 
inconsequential)—have done such an awfol thing? 

Some of the courses I was attending at this time were taught in large lecture theaters, 
where the students were seated in descending rows, row after row. In one of these 
courses —Introduction to Clinical Psychology, appropriately enough—I experienced a 
recurrent compulsion. I would take my seat behind some unwitting individual and listen 
to the professor speak. At some point during the lecture, I would unfailingly feel the urge 
to stab the point of my pen into the neck of the person in front of me. This impulse was 
not overwhelming—luckily—but it was powerful enough to disturb me. What sort of 
terrible person would have an impulse like that? Not me. I had never been aggressive. I 
had been smaller and younger than my classmates for most of my life. 

I went back to the prison, a month or so after my first visit. During my absence, two 
prisoners had attacked a third, a suspected informer. They held or tied him down and 
pulverized one of his legs with a lead pipe. I was taken aback, once again, but this time I 
tried something different. I tried to imagine, really imagine, what I would have to be like 
to do such a thing. I concentrated on this task for days and days—and experienced a 
frightening revelation. The truly appalling aspect of such atrocity did not lie in its 
impossibility or remoteness, as I had naively assumed, but in its ease. I was not much 



different from the violent prisoners—not qualitatively different. I could do what they 
could do (although I hadn’t). 

This discovery truly upset me. I was not who I thought I was. Surprisingly, however, 
the desire to stab someone with my pen disappeared. In retrospect, I would say that the 
behavioral urge had manifested itself in explicit knowledge—had been translated from 
emotion and image to concrete realization—and had no further “reason” to exist. The 
“impulse” had only occurred, because of the question I was attempting to answer: “How 
can men do terrible things to one another?” I meant other men, of course— bad men —but 
I had still asked the question. There was no reason for me to assume that I would receive 
a predictable or personally meaningless answer. 

At the same time, something odd was happening to my ability to converse. I had 
always enjoyed engaging in arguments, regardless of topic. I regarded them as a sort of 
game (not that this is in any way unique). Suddenly, however, I couldn’t talk—more 
accurately, I couldn’t stand listening to myself talk. I started to hear a “voice” inside my 
head, commenting on my opinions. Every time I said something, it said something— 
something critical. The voice employed a standard refrain, delivered in a somewhat bored 
and matter-of-fact tone: 

You don’t believe that. 

That isn’t true. 

You don’t believe that. 

That isn’t true. 

The “voice” applied such comments to almost every phrase I spoke. 

I couldn’t understand what to make of this. I knew the source of the commentary was 
part of me, but this knowledge only increased my confusion. Winch part, precisely, was 
me— the talking part or the criticizing part? If it was the talking part, then what was the 
criticizing part? If it was the criticizing part—well, then: how could virtually everything I 
said be untrue? In my ignorance and confusion, I decided to experiment. I tried only to 
say things that my internal reviewer would pass unchallenged. This meant that I really 
had to listen to what I was saying, that I spoke much less often, and that I would 
frequently stop, midway through a sentence, feel embarrassed, and reformulate my 
thoughts. I soon noticed that I felt much less agitated and more confident when I only 
said things that the “voice” did not object to. This came as a definite relief. My 
experiment had been a success; I was the criticizing part. Nonetheless, it took me a long 
time to reconcile myself to the idea that almost all my thoughts weren’t real, weren’t 
true—or, at least, weren’t mine. 

All the things I “believed” were things I thought sounded good, admirable, 
respectable, courageous. They weren’t my things, however—I had stolen them. Most of 
them I had taken from books. Having “understood” them, abstractly, I presumed I had a 
right to them—presumed that I could adopt them, as if they were mine: presumed that 
they were me. My head was stuffed frill of the ideas of others; stuffed frill of arguments I 
could not logically refute. I did not know then that an irrefutable argument is not 
necessarily true, nor that the right to identify with certain ideas had to be earned. 

I read something by Carl Jung, at about this time, that helped me understand what I 
was experiencing. It was Jung who formulated the concept of persona : the mask that 



“feigned individuality.” 3 Adoption of such a mask, according to Jung, allowed each of 
us—and those around us—to believe that we were authentic. Jung said: 

When we analyse the persona we strip off the mask, and discover that 
what seemed to be individual is at bottom collective; in other words, that 
the persona was only a mask of the collective psyche. Fundamentally the 
persona is nothing real: it is a compromise between individual and society 
as to what a man should appear to be. He takes a name, earns a title, 
exercises a function, he is this or that. In a certain sense all this is real, yet 
in relation to the essential individuality of the person concerned it is only 
a secondary reality, a compromise formation, in making which others 
often have a greater share than he. The persona is a semblance, a two- 
dimensional reality, to give it a nickname. 4 

Despite my verbal facility, I was not real. I found this painful to admit. 

I began to dream absolutely unbearable dreams. My dream life, up to this point, had 
been relatively uneventful, as far as I can remember; furthermore, I have never had a 
particularly good visual imagination. Nonetheless, my dreams became so horrible and so 
emotionally gripping that I was often afraid to go to sleep. I dreamt dreams vivid as 
reality. I could not escape from them or ignore them. They circulated, in general, around 
a single theme: that of nuclear war, and total devastation—around the worst evils that I, 
or something in me, could imagine: 

My parents lived in a standard ranch-style house, in a middle-class 
neighborhood, in a small town in northern Alberta. I was sitting in the 
darkened basement of this house, in the family room, watching TV, with 
my cousin Diane, who was in truth—in waking life—the most beautiful 
woman I had ever seen. A newscaster suddenly interrupted the program. 

The television picture and sound distorted, and static filled the screen. My 
cousin stood up and went behind the TV to check the electrical cord. She 
touched it, and started convulsing and frothing at the mouth, frozen 
upright by intense current. 

A brilliant flash of light from a small window flooded the basement. I 
rushed upstairs. There was nothing left of the ground floor of the house. It 
had been completely and cleanly sheared away, leaving only the floor, 
which now served the basement as a roof. Red and orange flames filled 
the sky>, from horizon to horizon. Nothing was left as far as I could see, 
except skeletal black ruins sticking up here and there: no houses, no trees, 
no signs of other human beings or of any life whatsoever. The entire town 
and everything that surrounded it on the flat prairie had been completely 
obliterated. 

It started to rain mud, heavily. The mud blotted out everything, and left 
the earth brown, wet, flat and dull, and the sky> leaden, even gray. A few 
distraught and shell-shocked people started to gather together. They were 
carrying unlabeled and dented cans of food, which contained nothing but 
mush and vegetables. They stood in the mud looking exhausted and 



disheveled. Some dogs emerged, out from under the basement stairs, 
where they had inexplicably taken residence. They were standing upright, 
on their hind legs. They were thin, like greyhounds, and had pointed 
noses. They looked like creatures of ritual—like Anubis, from the 
Egyptian tombs. They were carrying plates in front of them, which 
contained pieces of seared meat. They wanted to trade the meat for the 
cans. I took a plate. In the center of it was a circular slab of flesh four 
inches in diameter and one inch thick, foully cooked, oily, with a marrow 
bone in the center of it. Where did it come from? 

I had a terrible thought. I rushed downstairs to my cousin. The dogs 
had butchered her, and were offering the meat to the survivors of the 
disaster. 

I dreamed apocalyptic dreams of this intensity two or three times a week for a year or 
more, while I attended university classes and worked—as if nothing out of the ordinary 
was going on in my mind. Something I had no familiarity with was happening, however. 
I was being affected, simultaneously, by events on two “planes.” On the first plane were 
the normal, predictable, everyday occurrences that I shared with everybody else. On the 
second plane, however (unique to me, or so I thought) existed dreadftil images and 
unbearably intense emotional states. This idiosyncratic, subjective world—which 
everyone normally treated as illusory—seemed to me at that time to lie somehow behind 
the world everyone knew and regarded as real. But what did real mean? The closer I 
looked, the less comprehensible things became. Where was the real? What was at the 
bottom of it all? I did not feel I could live without knowing. 

My interest in the Cold War transformed itself into a true obsession. I thought about 
the suicidal and murderous preparation of that war every minute of every day, from the 
moment I woke up until the second I went to bed. How could such a state of affairs come 
about? Wlio was responsible? 

I dreamed that I was running through a mall parking lot, trying to escape 
from something. I was running through the parked cars, opening one 
door, crawling across the front seat, opening the other, moving to the 
next. The doors on one car suddenly slammed shut. I was in the passenger 
seat. The car started to move by itself. A voice said harshly, “there is no 
way out of here. ’’ I was on a journey, going somewhere I did not want to 
go. I was not the driver. 

I became very depressed and anxious. I had vaguely suicidal thoughts, but mostly wished 
that everything would just go away. I wanted to lie down on my couch, and sink into it, 
literally, until only my nose was showing—like the snorkel of a diver above the surface 
of the water. I found my awareness of things unbearable. 

I came home late one night from a college drinking party, self-disgusted and angry. I 
took a canvas board and some paints. I sketched a harsh, crude picture of a crucified 
Christ—glaring and demonic—with a cobra wrapped around his naked waist, like a belt. 
The picture disturbed me—struck me, despite my agnosticism, as sacrilegious. I did not 
know what it meant, however, or why I had painted it. Where in the world had it come 



from? 5 I hadn’t paid any attention to religious ideas for years. I hid the painting under 
some old clothes in my closet and sat cross-legged on the floor. I put my head down. It 
became obvious to me at that moment that I had not developed any real understanding of 
myself or of others. Everything I had once believed about the nature of society and 
myself had proved false, the world had apparently gone insane, and something strange 
and frightening was happening in my head. James Joyce said, “History is a nightmare 
from which I am trying to awake.” 6 For me, history literally was a nightmare. I wanted 
above all else at that moment to wake up and make my terrible dreams go away. 

I have been trying ever since then to make sense of the human capacity, my capacity, 
for evil—particularly for those evils associated with belief. I started by trying to make 
sense of my dreams. I couldn’t ignore them, after all. Perhaps they were trying to tell me 
something? I had nothing to lose by admitting the possibility. I read Freud’s 
Interpretation of Dreams and found it useful. Freud at least took the topic seriously—but 
I could not regard my nightmares as wish-fulfillments. Furthermore, they seemed more 
religions than sexual in nature. I knew, vaguely, that Jung had developed specialized 
knowledge of myth and religion, so I started through his writings. His thinking was 
granted little credence by the academics I knew, but they weren’t particularly concerned 
with dreams. I couldn’t help being concerned by mine. They were so intense I thought 
they might derange me. (What was the alternative? To believe that the terrors and pains 
they caused me were not real?) 

Much of the time I could not understand what Jung was getting at. He was making a 
point I could not grasp, speaking a language I did not comprehend. Now and then, 
however, his statements struck home. He offered this observation, for example: 

It must be admitted that the archetypal contents of the collective 
unconscious can often assume grotesque and horrible forms in dreams and 
fantasies, so that even the most hard-boiled rationalist is not immune from 
shattering nightmares and haunting fears. 7 

The second part of that statement certainly seemed applicable to me, although the first 
(“the archetypal contents of the collective unconscious”) remained mysterious and 
obscure. Still, this was promising. Jung at least recognized that the things that were 
happening to me could happen. Furthermore, he offered some hints as to their cause. So I 
kept reading. I soon came across the following hypothesis. Here was a potential solution 
to the problems I was facing—or at least the description of a place to look for such a 
solution: 

The psychological elucidation of...[dream and fantasy] images, which 
cannot be passed over in silence or blindly ignored, leads logically into 
the depths of religious phenomenology. The history of religion in its 
widest sense (including therefore mythology, folklore, and primitive 
psychology) is a treasure-house of archetypal forms from which the doctor 
can draw helpful parallels and enlightening comparisons for the purpose 
of calming and clarifying a consciousness that is all at sea. It is absolutely 
necessary to supply these fantastic images that rise up so strange and 
threatening before the mind’s eye with some kind of context so as to make 



them more intelligible. Experience has shown that the best way to do this 
is by means of comparative mythological material. 8 

The study of “comparative mythological material” in fact made my horrible dreams 
disappear. The cure wrought by this study, however, was purchased at the price of 
complete and often painful transformation: what I believe about the world, now—and 
how I act, in consequence—is so much at variance with what I believed when I was 
younger that I might as well be a completely different person. 

I discovered that beliefs make the world, in a very real way—that beliefs are the 
world, in a more than metaphysical sense. This discovery has not turned me into a moral 
relativist, however: quite the contrary. I have become convinced that the world-that-is- 
belief is orderly; that there are universal moral absolutes (although these are structured 
such that a diverse range of human opinion remains both possible and beneficial). I 
believe that individuals and societies who flout these absolutes—in ignorance or in 
willful opposition—are doomed to misery and eventual dissolution. 

f learned that the meanings of the most profound substrata of belief systems can be 
rendered explicitly comprehensible, even to the skeptical rational thinker—and that, so 
rendered, can be experienced as fascinating, profound and necessary. I learned why 
people wage war—why the desire to maintain, protect and expand the domain of belief 
motivates even the most incomprehensible acts of group-fostered oppression and 
cruelty—and what might be done to ameliorate this tendency, despite its universality. I 
learned, finally, that the terrible aspect of life might actually be a necessary precondition 
for the existence of life—and that it is possible to regard that precondition, in 
consequence, as comprehensible and acceptable, f hope that I can bring those who read 
this book to the same conclusions, without demanding any unreasonable “suspension of 
critical judgment”—excepting that necessary to initially encounter and consider the 
arguments I present. These can be summarized as follows: 

The world can be validly construed as a forum for action, as well as 
a place of things. We describe the world as a place of things, using 
the formal methods of science. The techniques of narrative, 
however—myth, literature and drama—portray the world as a 
forum for action. The two forms of representation have been 
unnecessarily set at odds, because we have not yet formed a clear 
picture of their respective domains. The domain of the former is the 
objective world—what is, from the perspective of intersubjective 
perception. The domain of the latter is the world of value—what is 
and what should be, from the perspective of emotion and action. 

The world as forum for action is composed, essentially, of three 
constituent elements, which tend to manifest themselves in typical 
patterns of metaphoric representation. First is unexplored 
territory—the Great Mother, nature, creative and destructive, 
source and final resting place of all determinate things. Second is 
explored territory—the Great Father, culture, protective and 
tyrannical, cumulative ancestral wisdom. Third is the process that 
mediates between unexplored and explored territory—the Divine 



Son, the archetypal individual, creative exploratory Word and 
vengeful adversary. We are adapted to this world of divine 
characters, much as to the objective world. The fact of this 
adaptation implies that the environment is in “reality” a forum for 
action, as well as a place of things. 

Unprotected exposure to unexplored territory produces fear. The 
individual is protected from such fear as a consequence of ritual 
imitation of the Great Father—as a consequence of the adoption of 
group identity, which restricts the meaning of things, and confers 
predictability on social interactions. When identification with the 
group is made absolute, however—when everything has to be 
controlled, when the unknown is no longer allowed to exist—the 
creative exploratory process that updates the group can no longer 
manifest itself. This restriction of adaptive capacity dramatically 
increases the probability of social aggression. 

Rejection of the unknown is tantamount to “identification with the 
devil,” the mythological counterpart and eternal adversary of the 
world-creating exploratory hero. Such rejection and identification is 
a consequence of Luciferian pride, which states: all that I know is 
all that is necessary to know. This pride is totalitarian assumption of 
omniscience—is adoption of God’s place by “reason”—is 
something that inevitably generates a state of personal and social 
being indistinguishable from hell. This hell develops because 
creative exploration—impossible, without (humble) 

acknowledgment of the unknown—constitutes the process that 
constructs and maintains the protective adaptive structure that 
gives life much of its acceptable meaning. 

“Identification with the devil” amplifies the dangers inherent in 
group identification, which tends of its own accord towards 
pathological stultification. Loyalty to personal interest-subjective 
meaning—can serve as an antidote to the overwhelming 
temptation constantly posed by the possibility of denying anomaly. 
Personal interest—subjective meaning—reveals itself at the 
juncture of explored and unexplored territory, and is indicative of 
participation in the process that ensures continued healthy 
individual and societal adaptation. 

Loyalty to personal interest is equivalent to identification with the 
archetypal hero—the “savior”—who upholds his association with 
the creative Word in the face of death, and despite group pressure 
to conform. Identification with the hero serves to decrease the 
unbearable motivational valence of the unknown; furthermore, 
provides the individual with a standpoint that simultaneously 
transcends and maintains the group. 


Similar summaries precede each chapter (and subchapter). Read as a unit, they comprise 
a complete but compressed picture of the book. These should be read first, after this 



preface. In this manner, the whole of the argument I am offering might come quickly to 
aid comprehension of the parts.

MAPS OF EXPERIENCE 

Object and Meaning 

The world can be validly construed as forum for action, or as place of 
things. 

The former manner of interpretation-more primordial, and less 
clearly understood-finds its expression in the arts or humanities, in 
ritual, drama, literature and mythology. The world as forum for 
action is a place of value, a place where all things have meaning. 
This meaning, which is shaped as a consequence of social 
interaction, is implication for action, or-at a higher level of analysis- 
implication for the configuration of the interpretive schema that 
produces or guides action. 

The latter manner of interpretation-the world as place of things- 
finds its formal expression in the methods and theories of science. 
Science allows for increasingly precise determination of the 
consensually validatable properties of things, and for efficient 
utilization of precisely determined things as tools (once the 
direction such use is to take has been determined, through 
application of more fundamental narrative processes). 

No complete world-picture can be generated without use of both 
modes of construal. The fact that one mode is generally set at odds 
with the other means only that the nature of their respective 
domains remains insufficiently discriminated. Adherents of the 
mythological worldview tend to regard the statements of their 
creeds as indistinguishable from empirical “fact,” even though such 
statements were generally formulated long before the notion of 
objective reality emerged. Those who, by contrast, accept the 
scientific perspective—who assume that it is, or might become, 
complete-forget that an impassable gulf currently divides what is 
from what should be. 

We need to know four things: 
what there is, 

what to do about what there is, 

that there is a difference between knowing what there is, and know 
ing what to do about what there is 
and what that difference is.

To explore something, to “discover what it is”—that means most importantly to discover 
its significance for motor output, within a particular social context, and only more 
particularly to determine its precise objective sensory or material nature. This is 
knowledge in the most basic of senses—and often constitutes sufficient knowledge. 

Imagine that a baby girl, toddling around in the course of her initial tentative 
investigations, reaches up onto a countertop to touch a fragile and expensive glass 
sculpture. She observes its color, sees its shine, feels that it is smooth and cold and heavy 
to the touch. Suddenly her mother interferes, grasps her hand, tells her not to ever touch 
that object. The child has just learned a number of specifically consequential things about 
the sculpture—has identified its sensory properties, certainly. More importantly, 
however, she has determined that approached in the wrong manner, the sculpture is 
dangerous (at least in the presence of mother); has discovered as well that the sculpture is 
regarded more highly, in its present unaltered configuration, than the exploratory 
tendency—at least (once again) by mother. The baby girl has simultaneously encountered 
an object, from the empirical perspective, and its socioculturally determined status. The 
empirical object might be regarded as those sensory properties “intrinsic” to the object. 
The status of the object, by contrast, consists of its meaning—consists of its implication 
for behavior. Everything a child encounters has this dual nature, experienced by the child 
as part of a unified totality. Everything is something, and means something—and the 
distinction between essence and significance is not necessarily drawn. 

The significance of something—specified in actuality as a consequence of exploratory 
activity undertaken in its vicinity—tends “naturally” to become assimilated to the object 
itself. The object, after all, is the proximal cause or the stimulus that “gives rise” to action 
conducted in its presence. For people operating naturally, like the child, what something 
signifies is more or less inextricably part of the thing, part of its magic. The magic is of 
course due to apprehension of the specific cultural and intrapsychic significance of the 
thing, and not to its objectively determinable sensory qualities. Everyone understands the 
child who says, for example, “I saw a scary man”; the child’s description is immediate 
and concrete, even though he or she has attibuted to the object of perception a quality that 
is in fact context-dependent and subjective. It is difficult, after all, to realize the 
subjective nature of fear, and not to feel threat as part of the “real” world. 

The automatic attribution of meaning to things—or the failure to distinguish between 
them initially—is a characteristic of narrative, of myth, not of scientific thought. 
Narrative accurately captures the nature of raw experience. Things are scary, people are 
irritating, events are promising, food is satisfying—at least in terms of our basic 
experience. The modern mind, which regards itself as having transcended the domain of 
the magical, is nonetheless still endlessly capable of “irrational” (read motivated) 
reactions. We fall under the spell of experience whenever we attribute our frustration, 
aggression, devotion or lust to the person or situation that exists as the proximal “cause” 
of such agitation. We are not yet “objective,” even in our most clear-headed moments 
(and thank God for that). We become immediately immersed in a motion picture or a 
novel, and willingly suspend disbelief. We become impressed or terrified, despite 
ourselves, in the presence of a sufficiently powerful cultural figurehead (an intellectual 
idol, a sports superstar, a movie actor, a political leader, the pope, a famous beauty, even 
our superior at work)—in the presence, that is, of anyone who sufficiently embodies the 
oil-implicit values and ideals that protect us from disorder and lead us on. Like the 



Maps of experience 3 


medieval individual, we do not even need the person to generate such affect. The icon 
will suffice. We will pay vast sums of money for articles of clothing worn or personal 
items used or created by the famous and infamous of our time. 9 

The “natural,” pre-experimental, or mythical mind is in fact primarily concerned with 
meaning—which is essentially implication for action—and not with “objective” nature. 
The formal object, as conceptualized by modern scientifically oriented consciousness, 
might appear to those still possessed by the mythic imagination—if they could “see” it at 
all—as an irrelevant shell, as all that was left after everything intrinsically intriguing had 
been stripped away. For the pre-experimentalist, the thing is most truly the significance 
of its sensory properties, as they are experienced in subjective experience—in affect, or 
emotion. And, in truth—in real life—to know what something is still means to know two 
things about it: its motivational relevance, and the specific nature of its sensory qualities. 
The two forms of knowing are not identical; furthermore, experience and registration of 
the former necessarily precedes development of the latter. Something must have 
emotional impact before it will attract enough attention to be explored and mapped in 
accordance with its sensory properties. Those sensory properties—of prime import to the 
experimentalist or empiricist—are meaningful only insofar as they serve as cues for 
determining specific affective relevance or behavioral significance. We need to know 
what things are not to know what they are but to keep track of what they mean —to 
understand what they signify for our behavior. 

It has taken centuries of firm discipline and intellectual training, religious, proto- 
scientific and scientific, to produce a mind capable of concentrating on phenomena that 
are not yet or are no longer immediately intrinsically gripping—to produce a mind that 
regards real as something separable from relevant. Alternatively, it might be suggested 
that all the myth has not yet vanished from science, devoted as it is to human progress, 
and that it is this nontrivial remainder that enables the scientist to retain undimmed 
enthusiasm while endlessly studying his ffuitflies. 

How, precisely, did people think, not so very long ago, before they were 
experimentalists? What were things before they were objective things? These are very 
difficult questions. The “things” that existed prior to the development of experimental 
science do not appear valid either as things or as the meaning of things to the modern 
mind. The question of the nature of the substance of sol —the sun—(to take a single 
example) occupied the minds of those who practiced the pre-experimental “science” of 
alchemy for many hundreds of years. We would no longer presume even that the sun has 
a uniform substance, unique to it, and would certainly take exception to the properties 
attributed to this hypothetical element by the medieval alchemist, if we allowed its 
existence. Carl Jung, who spent much of the latter part of his life studying medieval 
thought patterns, characterized sol: 

The sun signifies first of all gold, whose [alchemical] sign it shares. But 
just as the “philosophical” gold is not the “common” gold, so the sun is 
neither just the metallic gold nor the heavenly orb. Sometimes the sun is 
an active substance hidden in the gold and is extracted [alchemically] as 
the tinctura rubea (red tincture). Sometimes, as the heavenly body, it is 
the possessor of magically effective and transformative rays. As gold and 
a heavenly body it contains an active sulphur of a red colour, hot and dry. 



Maps of meaning 4 


Because of this red sulphur the alchemical sun, like the corresponding 
gold, is red. As every alchemist knew, gold owes its red color to the 
admixture of Cu (copper), which he interpreted as Kypris (the Cyprian, 

Venus), mentioned in Greek alchemy as the transformative substance. 
Redness, heat, and dryness are the classical qualities of the Egyptian Set 
(Greek Typhon), the evil principle which, like the alchemical sulphur, is 
closely connected with the devil. And just as Typhon has his kingdom in 
the forbidden sea, so the sun, as sol centralis, has its sea, its “crude 
perceptible water,” and as sol coelestis its “subtle imperceptible water.” 

This sea water (aquapontica) is extracted from sun and moon.... 

The active sun-substance also has favourable effects. As the so-called 
“balsam” it drips from the sun and produces lemons, oranges, wine, and, 
in the mineral kingdom, gold. 10 

We can barely understand such a description, contaminated as it is by imaginative and 
mythological associations peculiar to the medieval mind. It is precisely this fantastical 
contamination, however, that renders the alchemical description worth examining—not 
from the perspective of the history of science, concerned with the examination of 
outdated objective ideas, but from the perspective of psychology, focused on the 
interpretation of subjective frames of reference. 

“In it [the “Indian Ocean,” in this example] are images of heaven and earth, of 
summer, autumn, winter, and spring, male and female. If thou callest this spiritual, what 
thou doest is probable; if corporeal, thou sayest the truth; if heavenly, thou liest not; if 
earthly, thou hast well spoken.” 11 The alchemist could not separate his subjective ideas 
about the nature of things—that is, his hypotheses —from the things themselves. His 
hypotheses, in turn—products of his imagination—were derived from the unquestioned 
and unrecognized “explanatory” presuppositions that made up his culture. The medieval 
man lived, for example, in a universe that was moral —where everything, even ores and 
metals, strived above all for perfection. 12 Things, for the alchemical mind, were therefore 
characterized in large part by their moral nature—by their impact on what we would 
describe as affect, emotion or motivation; were therefore characterized by their relevance 
or value (which is impact on affect). Description of this relevance took narrative form, 
mythic form—as in the example drawn from Jung, where the sulphuric aspect of the 
sun’s substance is attributed negative, demonic characteristics. It was the great feat of 
science to strip affect from perception, so to speak, and to allow for the description of 
experiences purely in terms of their consensually apprehensible features. However, it is 
the case that the affects generated by experiences are real, as well. The alchemists, whose 
conceptualizations intermingled affect with sense, dealt with affect as a matter of course 
(although they did not “know” it—not explicitly). We have removed the affect from the 
thing, and can therefore brilliantly manipulate the thing. We are still victims, however, of 
the uncomprehended emotions generated by—we would say, in the presence of-—the 
thing. We have lost the mythic universe of the pre-experimental mind, or have at least 
ceased to further its development. That loss has left our increased technological power 
ever more dangerously at the mercy of our still unconscious systems of valuation. 

Prior to the time of Descartes, Bacon and Newton, man lived in an animated, spiritual 
world, saturated with meaning, imbued with moral purpose. The nature of this purpose 



Maps of experience 5 


was revealed in the stories people told each other—stories about the structure of the 
cosmos and the place of man. But now we think empirically (at least we think we think 
empirically), and the spirits that once inhabited the universe have vanished. The forces 
released by the advent of the experiment have wreaked havoc within the mythic world. 
Jung states: 

How totally different did the world appear to medieval man! For him the 
earth was eternally fixed and at rest in the center of the universe, encircled 
by the course of a sun that solicitously bestowed its warmth. Men were all 
children of God under the loving care of the Most High, who prepared 
them for eternal blessedness; and all knew exactly what they should do 
and how they should conduct themselves in order to rise from a 
corruptible world to an incorruptible and joyous existence. Such a life no 
longer seems real to us, even in our dreams. Natural science has long ago 
torn this lovely veil to shreds. 13 

Even if the medieval individual was not in all cases tenderly and completely enraptured 
by his religious beliefs (he was a great believer in hell, for example), he was certainly not 
plagued by the plethora of rational doubts and moral uncertainties that beset his modern 
counterpart. Religion for the pre-experimental mind was not so much a matter of faith as 
a matter of fact—which means that the prevailing religious viewpoint was not merely one 
compelling theory among many. 

The capacity to maintain explicit belief in religious “fact,” however, has been severely 
undermined in the last few centuries—first in the West, and then everywhere else. A 
succession of great scientists and iconoclasts has demonstrated that the universe does not 
revolve around man, that our notion of separate status from and “superiority” to the 
animal has no empirical basis, and that there is no God in heaven (nor even a heaven, as 
far as the eye can see). In consequence, we no longer believe our own stories—no longer 
even believe that those stories served us well in the past. The objects of revolutionary 
scientific discovery—Galileo’s mountains on the lunar orb; Kepler’s elliptical planetary 
orbits—manifested themselves in apparent violation of mythic order, predicated as it was 
on the presumption of heavenly perfection. The new phenomena produced by the 
procedures of experimentalists could not be, could not exist, from the perspective defined 
by tradition. Furthermore—and more importantly—the new theories that arose to make 
sense of empirical reality posed a severe threat to the integrity of traditional models of 
reality, which had provided the world with determinate meaning. The mythological 
cosmos had man at its midpoint; the objective universe was heliocentric at first, and less 
than that later. Man no longer occupies center stage. The world is, in consequence, a 
completely different place. 

The mythological perspective has been overthrown by the empirical; or so it appears. 
This should mean that the morality predicated upon such myth should have disappeared, 
as well, as belief in comfortable illusion vanished. Friedrich Nietzsche made this point 
clearly, more than a hundred years ago: 


When one gives up Christian belief [for example] one thereby deprives 
oneself of the right to Christian morality.... Christianity is a system, a 



Maps of meaning 6 


consistently thought out and complete view of things. If one breaks out of 
it a fundamental idea, the belief in God, one thereby breaks the whole 
thing to pieces: one has nothing of any consequence left in one’s hands. 
Christianity presupposes that man does not know, cannot know what is 
good for him and what evil: he believes in God, who alone knows. 
Christian morality is a command: its origin is transcendental; it is beyond 
all criticism, all right to criticize; it possesses truth only if God is truth—it 
stands or falls with the belief in God. If [modern Westerners] really do 
believe they know, of their own accord, “intuitively,” what is good and 
evil; if they consequently think they no longer have need of Christianity 
as a guarantee of morality; that is merely the consequence of the 
ascendancy of Christian evaluation and an expression of the strength and 
depth of this ascendancy: so that the origin of [modern] morality has been 
forgotten, so that the highly conditional nature of its right to exist is no 
longer felt. 14 

If the presuppositions of a theory have been invalidated, argues Nietzsche, then the 
theory has been invalidated. But in this case the “theory” survives. The fundamental 
tenets of the Judeo-Christian moral tradition continue to govern every aspect of the actual 
individual behavior and basic values of the typical Westerner—even if he is atheistic and 
well-educated, even if his abstract notions and utterances appear iconoclastic. He neither 
kills nor steals (or if he does, he hides his actions, even from his own awareness), and he 
tends, in theory, to treat his neighbor as himself. The principles that govern his society 
(and, increasingly, all others 15 ) remain predicated on mythic notions of individual 
value—intrinsic right and responsibility—despite scientific evidence of causality and 
determinism in human motivation. Finally, in his mind—even when sporadically 
criminal—the victim of a crime still cries out to heaven for “justice,” and the conscious 
lawbreaker still deserves punishment for his or her actions. 

Our systems of post-experimental thought and our systems of motivation and action 
therefore co-exist in paradoxical union. One is “up-to-date”; the other, archaic. One is 
scientific; the other, traditional, even superstitious. We have become atheistic in our 
description, but remain evidently religious—that is, moral —in our disposition. What we 
accept as true and how we act are no longer commensurate. We carry on as if our 
experience has meaning—as if our activities have transcendent value—but we are unable 
to justify this belief intellectually. We have become trapped by our own capacity for 
abstraction: it provides us with accurate descriptive information but also undermines our 
belief in the utility and meaning of existence. This problem has frequently been regarded 
as tragic (it seems to me, at least, ridiculous)—and has been thoroughly explored in 
existential philosophy and literature. Nietzsche described this modern condition as the 
(inevitable and necessary) consequence of the “death of God”: 

Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright 
morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly, “I seek 
God! I seek God!” As many of those who do not believe in God were 
standing around just then, he provoked much laughter.

Why, did he get lost? said one. Did he lose his way like a child? said 
another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us? Has he gone on a voyage? or 
emigrated? Thus they yelled and laughed. 

The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his 
glances. “Whither is God,” he cried. “I shall tell you. We have killed 
him —you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how have we done this? 

How were we able to drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe 
away the entire horizon? What did we do when we unchained this earth 
from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving now? 

Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continuously? Backward, 
sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there any up or down left? Are we 
not straying as through an infinite nothing? Do we not feel the breath of 
empty space? Has it not become colder? Is not night and more night 
coming on all the while? Must not lanterns be lit in the morning? Do we 
not hear anything yet of the noise of the grave-diggers who are burying 
God? Do we not smell anything yet of God’s decomposition? Gods too 
decompose. 

“God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. How shall 
we, the murderers of all murderers, comfort ourselves? What was holiest 
and most powerful of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death 
under our knives. Who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for 
us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games 
shall we have to invent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? 

Must not we ourselves become gods simply to seem worthy of it?” 16 

We find ourselves in an absurd and unfortunate situation—when our thoughts turn, 
involuntarily, to consideration of our situation. It seems impossible to believe that life is 
intrinsically, religiously meaningful. We continue to act and think “as if’—as if nothing 
fundamental has really changed. This does not change the fact that our integrity has 
vanished. 

The great forces of empiricism and rationality and the great technique of the 
experiment have killed myth, and it cannot be resurrected—or so it seems. We still act 
out the precepts of our forebears, nonetheless, although we can no longer justify our 
actions. Our behavior is shaped (at least in the ideal) by the same mythic rules —thou 
shalt not kill, thou shalt not covet —that guided our ancestors for the thousands of years 
they lived without benefit of formal empirical thought. This means that those rules are so 
powerful—so necessary, at least—that they maintain their existence (and expand their 
domain) even in the presence of explicit theories that undermine their validity. That is a 
mystery. And here is another: 

How is it that complex and admirable ancient civilizations could have developed and 
flourished, initially, if they were predicated upon nonsense? (If a culture survives, and 
grows, does that not indicate in some profound way that the ideas it is based upon are 
valid? If myths are mere superstitious proto-theories, why did they work? Why were they 
remembered? Our great rationalist ideologies, after all—fascist, say, or communist— 
demonstrated their essential uselessness within the space of mere generations, despite 
their intellectually compelling nature. Traditional societies, predicated on religious 



Maps of meaning 8 


notions, have survived—essentially unchanged, in some cases, for tens of thousands of 
years. How can this longevity be understood?) Is it actually sensible to argue that 
persistently success till traditions are based on ideas that are simply wrong, regardless of 
their utility? 

Is it not more likely that we just do not know how it could be that traditional notions 
are right, given their appearance of extreme irrationality? 

Is it not likely that this indicates modern philosophical ignorance, rather than ancestral 
philosophical error? 

We have made the great mistake of assuming that the “world of spirit” described by 
those who preceded us was the modern “world of matter,” primitively conceptualized. 
This is not true—at least not in the simple manner we generally believe. The cosmos 
described by mythology was not the same place known to the practitioners of modern 
science—but that does not mean it was not real. We have not yet found God above, nor 
the devil below, because we do not yet understand where “above” and “below” might be 
found. 

We do not know what our ancestors were talking about. This is not surprising, because 
they did not “know,” either (and it didn’t really matter to them that they did not know). 
Consider this archaic creation myth 17 from Sumer—the “birthplace of history”: 

So far, no cosmogonic text properly speaking has been discovered, but 
some allusions permit us to reconstruct the decisive moments of creation, 
as the Sumerians conceived it. The goddess Nammu (whose name is 
written with the pictograph representing the primordial sea) is presented 
as “the mother who gave birth to the Sky and the Earth” and the 
“ancestress who brought forth all the gods.” The theme of the primordial 
waters, imagined as a totality at once cosmic and divine, is quite frequent 
in archaic cosmogonies. In this case too, the watery mass is identified 
with the original Mother, who, by parthenogenesis, gave birth to the first 
couple, the Sky (An) and the Earth (Ki), incarnating the male and female 
principles. This first couple was united, to the point of merging, in the 
hieros gamos [mystical marriage]. From their union was born En-lil, the 
god of the atmosphere. Another fragment informs us that the latter 
separated his parents.... The cosmogonic theme of the separation of sky 
and earth is also widely disseminated. 18 

This myth is typical of archaic descriptions of reality. What does it mean to say that the 
Sumerians believed that the world emerged from a “primordial sea,” which was the 
mother of all, and that the sky and the earth were separated by the act of a deity? We do 
not know. Our abysmal ignorance in this regard has not been matched, however, by a 
suitable caution. We appear to have made the presumption that stories such as these— 
myths—were equivalent in function and intent (but were inferior methodologically) to 
empirical or post-experimental description. It is this fundamentally absurd insistence that, 
above all, has destabilized the effect of religious tradition upon the organization of 
modern human moral reasoning and behavior. The “world” of the Sumerians was not 
objective reality, as we presently construe it. It was simultaneously more and less—more, 
in that this “primitive” world contained phenomena that we do not consider part of 



Maps of experience 9 


“reality,” such as affect and meaning; less, in that the Sumerians could not describe (or 
conceive ot) many of those things the processes of science have revealed to us. 

Myth is not primitive proto-science. It is a qualitatively different phenomenon. 
Science might be considered “description of the world with regards to those aspects that 
are consensually apprehensible” or “specification of the most effective mode of reaching 
an end (given a defined end).” Myth can be more accurately regarded as “description of 
the world as it signifies (for action)” The mythic universe is a place to act, not a place to 
perceive. Myth describes things in terms of their unique or shared affective valence, their 
value, their motivational significance. The Sky (An) and the Earth (Ki) of the Sumerians 
are not the sky and earth of modern man, therefore; they are the Great Father and Mother 
of all things (including the thing—En-lil, who is actually a process—that in some sense 
gave rise to them). 

We do not understand pre-experimental thinking, so we try to explain it in terms that 
we do understand—which means that we explain it away, define it as nonsense. After all, 
we think scientifically—so we believe—and we think we know what that means (since 
scientific thinking can in principle be defined). We are familiar with scientific thinking 
and value it highly—so we tend to presume that it is all there is to thinking (presume that 
all other “forms of thought” are approximations, at best, to the ideal of scientific 
thought). But this is not accurate. Thinking also and more fundamentally is specification 
of value, specification of implication for behavior. This means that categorization, with 
regards to value—determination (or even perception) of what constitutes a single thing, 
or class of things—is the act of grouping together according to implication for behavior. 

The Sumerian category of Sky (An), for example, is a domain of phenomena with 
similar implications for behavioral output, or for affect; the same can be said for the 
category of Earth (Ki), and all other mythic categories. The fact that the “domain of the 
Sky” has implications for action—has motivational significance—makes it a deity (which 
is something that controls behavior, or at least that must be served). Comprehension of 
the fact that such a classification system actually has meaning necessitates learning to 
think differently (necessitates, as well, learning to think about thinking differently). 

The Sumerians were concerned, above all, with how to act (were concerned with the 
value of things). Their descriptions of reality (to which we attribute the qualities of proto¬ 
science) in fact comprised their summary of the world as phenomenon—as place to act. 
They did not “know” this—not explicitly —any more than we do. But it was still true. 

The empirical endeavor is devoted to objective description of what is —to 
determination of what it is about a given phenomena that can be consensually validated 
and described. The objects of this process may be those of the past, the present, or the 
future, and may be static or dynamic in nature: a good scientific theory allows for 
prediction and control of becoming (of “transformation”) as well as being. However, the 
“affect” that an encounter with an “object” generates is not a part of what that object is, 
from this perspective, and therefore must be eliminated from further consideration (along 
with anything else subjective)—must be at least eliminated from definition as a real 
aspect of the object. 

The painstaking empirical process of identification, communication and comparison 
has proved to be a strikingly effective means for specifying the nature of the relatively 
invariant features of the collectively apprehensible world. Unfortunately, this useful 
methodology cannot be applied to determination of value —to consideration of what 



Maps of meaning 10 


should be, to specification of the direction that things should take (which means, to 
description of the future we should construct, as a consequence of our actions). Such acts 
of valuation necessarily constitute moral decisions. We can use information generated in 
consequence of the application of science to guide those decisions, but not to tell us if 
they are correct. We lack a process of verification, in the moral domain, that is as 
powerful or as universally acceptable as the experimental (empirical) method in the realm 
of description. This absence does not allow us to sidestep the problem. No functioning 
society or individual can avoid rendering moral judgment, regardless of what might be 
said or imagined about the necessity of such judgment. Action presupposes valuation, or 
its implicit or “unconscious” equivalent. To act is literally to manifest preference about 
one set of possibilities, contrasted with an infinite set of alternatives. If we wish to live, 
we must act. Acting, we value. Lacking omniscience, painfully, we must make decisions, 
in the absence of sufficient information. It is, traditionally speaking, our knowledge of 
good and evil, our moral sensibility, that allows us this ability. It is our mythological 
conventions, operating implicitly or explicitly, that guide our choices. But what are these 
conventions? How are we to understand the fact of their existence? How are we to 
understand them? 

It was Nietzsche, once again, who put his finger on the modern problem, central to 
issues of valence or meaning: not, as before “how to act, from within the confines of a 
particular culture,” but “whether to believe that the question of how to act could even be 
reasonably asked, let alone answered”: 

Just because our moral philosophers knew the facts of morality only very 
approximately in arbitrary extracts or in accidental epitomes—for 
example, as the morality of their environment, their class, their church, the 
spirit of their time, their climate and part of the world—just because they 
were poorly informed and not even very curious about different peoples, 
times, and past ages—they never laid eyes on the real problems of 
morality; for these emerge only when we compare many moralities. In all 
“science of morals” so far one thing was lacking, strange as it may sound: 
the problem of morality itself; what was lacking was any suspicion that 
there was something problematic here. 19 

This “problem of morality”— is there anything moral, in any realistic general sense, and 
if so, how might it be comprehended? —is a question that has now attained paramount 
importance. We have the technological power to do anything we want (certainly, 
anything destructive; potentially, anything creative); commingled with that power, 
however, is an equally profound existential uncertainty, shallowness and contusion. Our 
constant cross-cultural interchanges and our capacity for critical reasoning have 
undermined our faith in the traditions of our forebears, perhaps for good reason. 
However, the individual cannot live without belief—without action and valuation—and 
science cannot provide that belief. We must nonetheless put our faith into something. Are 
the myths we have turned to since the rise of science more sophisticated, less dangerous, 
and more complete than those we rejected? The ideological structures that dominated 
social relations in the twentieth century appear no less absurd, on the face of it, than the 
older belief systems they supplanted; they lacked, in addition, any of the 



Maps of experience 11 


incomprehensible mystery that necessarily remains part of genuinely artistic and creative 
production. The fundamental propositions of fascism and communism were rational, 
logical, statable, comprehensible—and terribly wrong. No great ideological struggle 
presently tears at the soul of the world, but it is difficult to believe that we have outgrown 
our gullibility. The rise of the New Age movement in the West, for example—as 
compensation for the decline of traditional spirituality—provides sufficient evidence for 
our continued ability to swallow a camel, while straining at a gnat. 

Could we do better? Is it possible to understand what might reasonably, even 
admirably, be believed, after understanding that we must believe? Our vast power makes 
self-control (and, perhaps, self-comprehension) a necessity—so we have the motivation, 
at least in principle. Furthermore, the time is auspicious. The third Christian millennium 
is dawning—at the end of an era when we have demonstrated, to the apparent satisfaction 
of everyone, that certain forms of social regulation just do not work (even when judged 
by their own criteria for success). We live in the aftermath of the great statist experiments 
of the twentieth century, after all, conducted as Nietzsche prophesied: 

In the doctrine of socialism there is hidden, rather badly, a “will to negate 
life”; the human beings or races that think up such a doctrine must be 
bungled. Indeed, I should wish that a few great experiments might prove 
that in a socialist society life negates itself, cuts off its own roots. The 
earth is large enough and man still sufficiently unexhausted; hence such a 
practical instruction and demonstratio ad absurdum would not strike me 
as undesirable, even if it were gained and paid for with a tremendous 
expenditure of human lives. 20 

There appears to exist some “natural” or even—dare it be said?—some “absolute” 
constraints on the manner in which human beings may act as individuals and in society. 
Some moral presuppositions and theories are wrong; human nature is not infinitely 
malleable. 

It has become more or less evident, for example, that pure, abstract rationality, 
ungrounded in tradition—the rationality that defined Soviet-style communism from 
inception to dissolution—appears absolutely unable to determine and make explicit just 
what it is that should guide individual and social behavior. Some systems do not work, 
even though they make abstract sense (even more sense than alternative, currently 
operative, incomprehensible, haphazardly evolved systems). Some patterns of 
interpersonal interaction—which constitute the state, insofar as it exists as a model for 
social behavior—do not produce the ends they are supposed to produce, cannot sustain 
themselves over time, and may even produce contrary ends, devouring those who profess 
their value and enact them. Perhaps this is because planned, logical and intelligible 
systems fail to make allowance for the irrational, transcendent, incomprehensible and 
often ridiculous aspect of human character, as described by Dostoevsky: 

Now I ask you: what can be expected of man since he is a being endowed 
with such strange qualities? Shower upon him every earthly blessing, 
drown him in a sea of happiness, so that nothing but bubbles of bliss can 
be seen on the surface; give him economic prosperity, such that he should 



Maps of meaning 12 


have nothing else to do but sleep, eat cakes and busy himself with the 
continuation of his species, and even then out of sheer ingratitude, sheer 
spite, man would play you some nasty trick. He would even risk his cakes 
and would deliberately desire the most fatal rubbish, the most 
uneconomical absurdity, simply to introduce into all this positive good 
sense his fatal fantastic element. It is just his fantastic dreams, his vulgar 
folly that he will desire to retain, simply in order to prove to himself—as 
though that were so necessary—that men still are men and not the keys of 
a piano, which the laws of nature threaten to control so completely that 
soon one will be able to desire nothing but by the calendar. 

And that is not all: even if man really were nothing but a piano-key, 
even if this were proved to him by natural science and mathematics, even 
then he would not become reasonable, but would purposely do something 
perverse out of simple ingratitude, simply to gain his point. And if he does 
not find means he will contrive destruction and chaos, will contrive 
sufferings of all sorts, only to gain his point! He will launch a curse upon 
the world, and as only man can curse (it is his privilege, the primary 
distinction between him and other animals), maybe by his curse alone he 
will attain his object—that is, convince himself that he is a man and not a 
piano-key! If you say that all this, too, can be calculated and tabulated, 
chaos and darkness and curses, so that the mere possibility of calculating 
it all beforehand would stop it all, and reason would reassert itself, then 
man would purposely go mad in order to be rid of reason and gain his 
point! I believe in it, I answer for it, for the whole work of man really 
seems to consist in nothing but proving to himself every minute that he is 
a man and not a piano-key! It may be at the cost of his skin, it may be by 
cannibalism! And this being so, can one help being tempted to rejoice that 
it has not yet come off, and that desire still depends on something we 
don’t know? 21 

We also presently possess in accessible and complete form the traditional wisdom of a 
large part of the human race—possess accurate description of the myths and rituals that 
contain and condition the implicit and explicit values of almost everyone who has ever 
lived. These myths are centrally and properly concerned with the nature of successful 
human existence. Careful comparative analysis of this great body of religious philosophy 
might allow us to provisionally determine the nature of essential human motivation and 
morality—if we were willing to admit our ignorance and take the risk. Accurate 
specification of underlying mythological commonalities might comprise the first 
developmental stage in the conscious evolution of a truly universal system of morality. 
The establishment of such a system, acceptable to empirical and religious minds alike, 
could prove of incalculable aid in the reduction of intrapsychic, interindividual and 
intergroup conflict. The grounding of such a compara-tive analysis within a psychology 
(or even a neuropsychology) informed by strict empirical research might offer us the 
possibility of a form of convergent validation, and help us overcome the age-old problem 
of deriving the ought from the is; help us see how what we must do might be inextricably 
associated with what it is that we are. 



Maps of experience 13 


Proper analysis of mythology, of the type proposed here, is not mere discussion of 
“historical” events enacted upon the world stage (as the traditionally religious might have 
it), and it is not mere investigation of primitive belief (as the traditionally scientific might 
presume). It is, instead, the examination, analysis and subsequent incorporation of an 
edifice of meaning, which contains within it hierarchical organization of experiential 
valence. The mythic imagination is concerned with the world in the manner of the 
phenomenologist, who seeks to discover the nature of subjective reality, instead of 
concerning himself with description of the objective world. Myth, and the drama that is 
part of myth, provide answers in image to the following question: “how can the current 
state of experience be conceptualized in abstraction, with regards to its meaning?” [which 
means its (subjective, biologically predicated, socially constructed) emotional relevance 
or motivational significance]. Meaning means implication for behavioral output; 
logically, therefore, myth presents information relevant to the most fundamental of moral 
problems: “what should be? (what should be done?) ” The desirable future (the object of 
what should be) can be conceptualized only in relationship to the present, which serves at 
least as a necessary point of contrast and comparison. To get somewhere in the future 
presupposes being somewhere in the present; furthermore, the desirability of the place 
traveled to depends on the valence of the place vacated. The question of “what should 
be? ” (what line should be traveled?) therefore has contained within it, so to speak, three 
subqueries, which might be formulated as follows: 

1) What is? What is the nature (meaning, the significance) of the current state of 
experience? 

2) What should be? To what (desirable, valuable) end should that state be moving? 

3) How should we therefore act? What is the nature of the specific processes by which 
the present state might be transformed into that which is desired? 

Active apprehension of the goal of behavior, conceptualized in relationship to the 
interpreted present, serves to constrain or provide determinate framework for the 
evaluation of ongoing events, which emerge as a consequence of current behavior. The 
goal is an imaginary state, consisting of “a place” of desirable motivation or affect—a 
state that only exists in fantasy, as something (potentially) preferable to the present. 
(Construction of the goal therefore means establishment of a theory about the ideal 
relative status of motivational states—about the good.) This imagined future constitutes a 
vision of perfection, so to speak, generated in the light of all current knowledge (at least 
under optimal conditions), to which specific and general aspects of ongoing experience 
are continually compared. This vision of perfection is the promised land, mythologically 
speaking—conceptualized as a spiritual domain (a psychological state), a political utopia 
(a state, literally speaking), or both, simultaneously. 

We answer the question “what should be? ” by formulating an image of the desired 
future. 

We cannot conceive of that future, except in relationship to the (interpreted) present— 
and it is our interpretation of the emotional acceptability of the present that comprises our 
answer to the question “what is? ” [“what is the nature (meaning, the significance) of the 
current state of experience?”]. 

We answer the question “how then should we act? ” by determining the most efficient 
and self-consistent strategy, all things considered, for bringing the preferred future into 
being. 



Maps of meaning 14 


Our answers to these three fundamental questions—modified and constructed in the 
course of our social interactions—constitutes our knowledge, insofar as it has any 
behavioral relevance; constitutes our knowledge, from the mythological perspective. The 
structure of the mythic known —what is, what should be, and how to get from one to the 
other—is presented in Figure 1: The Domain and Constituent Elements of the Known. 

The known is explored territory, a place of stability and familiarity; it is the “city of 
God,” as profanely realized. It finds metaphorical embodiment in myths and narratives 
describing the community, the kingdom or the state. Such myths and narratives guide our 
ability to understand the particular, bounded motivational significance of the present, 
experienced in relation to some identifiable desired future, and allow us to construct and 
interpret appropriate patterns of action, from within the confines of that schema. We all 
produce determinate models of what is, and what should be, and how to transform one 
into the other. We produce these models by balancing our own desires, as they find 
expression in fantasy and action, with those of the others—individuals, families and 
communities—that we habitually encounter. “How to act,” constitutes the most essential 
aspect of the social contract; the domain of the known is, therefore, the “territory” we 
inhabit with all those who share our implicit and explicit traditions and beliefs. Myths 
describe the existence of this “shared and determinate territory” as a fixed aspect of 
existence—which it is, as the fact of culture is an unchanging aspect of the human 
environment. 

“Narratives of the known”—patriotic rituals, stories of ancestral heroes, myths and 
symbols of cultural or racial identity—describe established territory, weaving for us a 
web of meaning that, shared with others, eliminates the necessity of dispute over 
meaning. All those who know the rules, and accept them, can play the game—without 
fighting over the rules of the game. This makes for peace, stability, and potential 
prosperity—a good game. The good, however, is the enemy of the better; a more 
compelling game might always exist. Myth portrays what is known, and performs a 
function that if limited to that, might be regarded as paramount in importance. But myth 
also presents information that is far more profound—almost unutterably so, once (I 
would argue) properly understood. We all produce models of what is and what should be, 
and how to transform one into the other. We change our behavior, when the 
consequences of that behavior are not what we would like. But sometimes mere alteration 
in behavior is insufficient. We must change not only what we do, but what we think is 
important. This means reconsideration of the nature of the motivational significance of 
the present, and reconsideration of the ideal nature of the future. This is a radical, even 
revolutionary transformation, and it is a very complex process in its realization—but 
mythic thinking has represented the nature of such change in great and remarkable detail. 



Maps of experience 15 



Figure 1: The Domain and Constituent Elements of 
the Known 

The basic grammatical structure of transformational mythology, so to speak, appears 
most clearly revealed in the form of the “way” (as in the “American Way of Life”). The 
great literary critic Northrop Frye comments upon the idea of the way, as it manifests 
itself in literature and religious writing: 

Following a narrative is closely connected with the central literary 
metaphor of the journey, where we have a person making the journey and 
the road, path, or direction taken, the simplest word for this being ‘way.’ 
Journey is a word connected with jour and journee, and metaphorical 
journeys, deriving as they mostly do from slower methods of getting 
around, usually have at their core the conception of the days journey, the 
amount of space we can cover under the cycle of the sun. By a very easy 
extension of metaphor we get the days cycle as a symbol for the whole of 
life. Thus in Flousman’s poem “Reveille” (“Up, lad: when the journey’s 
over/There’ll be time enough to sleep”) the awakening in the morning is a 
metaphor of continuing the journey of life, a journey ending in death. The 
prototype for the image is the Book of Ecclesiastes, which urges us to 
work while it is day, before the night comes when no man can work.... 

The word “way” is a good example of the extent to which language is 
built up on a series of metaphorical analogies. The most common meaning 





Maps of meaning 16 


of “way” in English is a method or manner of procedure, blit method and 
manner imply some sequential repetition, and the repetition brings us to 
the metaphorical kernel of a road or path.... In the Bible “way” normally 
translates the Hebrew derek and the Greek hodos, and throughout the 
Bible there is a strong emphasis on the contrast between a straight way 
that takes us to our destination and a divergent way that misleads or 
confuses. This metaphorical contrast haunts the whole of Christian 
literature: we start reading Dante’s Commedia, and the third line speaks of 
a lost or erased way: “Che la diritta via era smarita.” Other religions have 
the same metaphor: Buddhism speaks of what is usually called in English 
an eightfold path. In Chinese Taoism the Tao is usually also rendered 
“way” by Arthur Waley and others, though I understand that the character 
representing the word is formed of radicals meaning something like 
“head-going.” The sacred book of Taoism, the Tao te Ching, begins by 
saying that the Tao that can be talked about is not the real Tao: in other 
words we are being warned to beware of the traps in metaphorical 
language, or, in a common Oriental phrase, of contusing the moon with 
the finger pointing at it. But as we read on we find that the Tao can, after 
all, be to some extent characterized: the way is specifically the “way of 
the valley,” the direction taken by humility, self-effacement, and the kind 
of relaxation, or non-action, that makes all action effective. 22 

The “way” is the path of life and its purpose. 23 More accurately, the content of the way is 
the specific path of life. The form of the way, its most fundamental aspect, is the 
apparently intrinsic or heritable possibility of positing or of being guided by a central 
idea. This apparently intrinsic form finds its expression in the tendency of each 
individual, generation after generation, to first ask and subsequently seek an answer to 
the question “what is the meaning of life?” 

The central notion of the way underlies manifestation of four more specific myths, or 
classes of myths, and provides a more complete answer, in dramatic form, to the three 
questions posed previously [what is the nature (meaning, the significance) of current 
being?, to what (desirable) end should that state be moving? and, finally, what are the 
processes by which the present state might be transformed into that which is desired?] 
The four classes include: 

(1) myths describing a current or pre-existent stable state (sometimes a paradise, 
sometimes a tyranny); 

(2) myths describing the emergence of something anomalous, unexpected, threatening 
and promising into this initial state; 

(3) myths describing the dissolution of the pre-existent stable state into chaos, as a 
consequence of the anomalous or unexpected occurrence; 

(4) myths describing the regeneration of stability [paradise regained (or, tyranny 
regenerated)], from the chaotic mixture of dissolute previous experience and 
anomalous information. 


The metamythology of the way, so to speak, describes the manner in which specific ideas 
(myths) about the present, the future, and the mode of transforming one into the other are 



Maps of experience 17 


initially constructed, and then reconstructed, in their entirety, when that becomes 
necessary. 



Figure 2: The Metamythological Cycle of the Way 

The traditional Christian (and not just Christian) notion that man has fallen from an 
original “state of grace” into his current morally degenerate and emotionally unbearable 
condition—accompanied by a desire for the “return to Paradise”—constitutes a single 
example of this “metamyth.” Christian morality can therefore be reasonably regarded as 
the “plan of action” whose aim is re-establishment, or establishment, or attainment 
(sometimes in the “hereafter”) of the “kingdom of God,” the ideal future. The idea that 
man needs redemption—and that re-establishment of a long-lost Paradise might 
constitute such redemption—appear as common themes of mythology, among members 
of exceedingly diverse and long-separated human cultures. 24 This commonality appears 
because man, eternally self-conscious, suffers eternally from his existence, and constantly 
longs for respite. 

Figure 2: The Metamythological Cycle of the Way schematically portrays the “circle” 
of the way, which “begins” and “ends” at the same point—with establishment of 
conditional, but determinate moral knowledge (belief). Belief is disruptible, because 
finite—which is to say that the infinite mystery surrounding human understanding may 
break into our provisional models of how to act at any time and point, and disrupt their 
structure. The manner in which we act as children, for example, may be perfectly

appropriate for the conditions of childhood; the processes of maturation change the 
conditions of existence, introducing anomaly where only certainty once stood, making 
necessary not only a change of plans, but reconceptualization of where those plans might 
lead, and what or who they refer to, in the present. 

The known, our current story, protects us from the unknown, from chaos —which is to 
say, provides our experience with determinate and predictable structure. Chaos has a 
nature all of its own. That nature is experienced as affective valence, at first exposure, not 
as objective property. If something unknown or unpredictable occurs, while we are 
carrying out our motivated plans, we are first surprised. That surprise—which is a 
combination of apprehension and curiosity—comprises our instinctive emotional 
response to the occurrence of something we did not desire. The appearance of something 
unexpected is proof that we do not know how to act—by definition, as it is the production 
of what we want that we use as evidence for the integrity of our knowledge. If we are 
somewhere we don’t know how to act, we are (probably) in trouble—we might learn 
something new, but we are still in trouble. When we are in trouble, we get scared. When 
we are in the domain of the known, so to speak, there is no reason for fear. Outside that 
domain, panic reigns. It is for this reason that we dislike having our plans disrupted, and 
cling to what we understand. This conservative strategy does not always work, however, 
because what we understand about the present is not necessarily sufficient to deal with 
the future. This means that we have to be able to modify what we understand, even 
though to do so is to risk our own undoing. The trick, of course, is to modify and yet to 
remain secure. This is not so simple. Too much modification brings chaos. Too little 
modification brings stagnation (and then, when the future we are unprepared for 
appears—chaos). 

Involuntary exposure to chaos means accidental encounter with the forces that 
undermine the known world. The affective consequences of such encounter can be 
literally overwhelming. It is for this reason that individuals are highly motivated to avoid 
sudden manifestations of the unknown. And this is why individuals will go to almost any 
length to ensure that their protective cultural “stories” remain intact.

MAPS OF MEANING 

Three Levels of Analysis 

Human beings are prepared, biologically, to respond to anomalous 
information—to novelty. This instinctive response includes redirection of 
attention, generation of emotion (fear first, generally speaking, then 
curiosity), and behavioral compulsion (cessation of ongoing activity first, 
generally speaking, then active approach and exploration). This pattern of 
instinctive response drives learning—particularly, but not exclusively, the 
learning of appropriate behavior. All such learning takes place—or took 
place originally—as a consequence of contact with novelty, or anomaly. 

What is novel is of course dependent on what is known—is 
necessarily defined in opposition to what is known. Furthermore, 
what is known is always known conditionally, since human 
knowledge is necessarily limited. Our conditional knowledge, 
insofar as that knowledge is relevant for the regulation of emotion, 
consists of our models of the emotional significance of the present, 
defined in opposition to an idealized, hypothetical or fantasied 
future state. We evaluate the “unbearable present” in relationship 
to the “ideal future.” We act to transform “where we are” into “where 
we would like to be.” 

When our attempts to transform the present work as planned, 
we remain firmly positioned in the domain of the known 
(metaphorically speaking). When our behaviors produce results 
that we did not want, however—that is, when we err—we move into 
the domain of the unknown, where more primordial emotional 
forces rule. “Small-scale” errors force us to reconstruct our plans, 
but allow us to retain our goals and our conceptualizations of 
present conditions. Catastrophic errors, by contrast, force us not 
only to re-evaluate our means, but our starting points and our ends. 
Such revaluation necessarily involves extreme emotional 
dysregulation. 

The “domain of the known” and the “domain of the unknown” 
can reasonably be regarded as permanent constituent elements of 
human experience—even of the human environment. Regardless 
of culture, place and time, human individuals are forced to adapt to 
the fact of culture (the domain of the known, roughly speaking) and 
the fact of its ultimate insufficiency (as the domain of the unknown 
necessarily remains extant, regardless of extent of previous 
“adaptation”). The human brain—and the higher animal brain— 



Maps of meaning 20 


appears therefore to have adapted itself to the eternal presence of 
these two “places”; the brain has one mode of operation when in 
explored territory, and another when in unexplored territory. In the 
unexplored world, caution—expressed in fear and behavioral 
immobility—initially predominates, but may be superseded by 
curiosity—expressed in hope, excitement and, above all, in creative 
exploratory behavior. Creative exploration of the unknown, and 
consequent generation of knowledge, is construction or update of 
patterns of behavior and representation, such that the unknown is 
transformed from something terrifying and compelling into 
something beneficial (or, at least, something irrelevant). The 
presence of capacity for such creative exploration and knowledge 
generation may be regarded as the third, and final, permanent 
constituent element of human experience (in addition to the domain 
of the “known” and “unknown”). 

Mythological representations of the world—which are 
representations of reality as a forum for action—portray the 
dynamic interrelationship between all three constituent elements of 
human experience. The eternal unknown—nature, metaphorically 
speaking, creative and destructive, source and destination of all 
determinant things—is generally ascribed an affectively ambivalent 
feminine character (as the “mother” and eventual “devourer” of 
everyone and everything). The eternal known, in contrast—culture, 
defined territory, tyrannical and protective, predictable, disciplined 
and restrictive, cumulative consequence of heroic or exploratory 
behavior—is typically considered masculine (in contradistinction to 
“mother” nature). The eternal knower, finally—the process that 
mediates between the known and the unknown—is the knight who 
slays the dragon of chaos, the hero who replaces disorder and 
confusion with clarity and certainty, the sun god who eternally slays 
the forces of darkness, and the “word” that engenders cosmic 
creation. 


NORMAL AND REVOLUTIONARY LIFE: TWO PROSAIC 

STORIES 

We tell ourselves stories about who we are, where we would like to be, 
and how we are going to get there. These stories regulate our emotions, by 
determining the significance of all the things we encounter and all the 
events we experience. We regard things that get us on our way as positive, 
things that impede our progress as negative, and things that do neither as 
irrelevant. Most things are irrelevant—and that is a good thing, as we 
have limited attentional resources. 

Inconveniences interfere with our plans. We do not like 
inconveniences, and will avoid dealing with them. Nonetheless, 



Maps of Meaning 21 


they occur commonly—so commonly, in fact, that they might be 
regarded as an integral, predictable, and constant feature of the 
human environment. We have adapted to this feature—have the 
intrinsic resources to cope with inconveniences. We benefit, 
become stronger, in doing so. 

Ignored inconveniences accumulate, rather than disappear. 

When they accumulate in sufficient numbers, they produce a 
catastrophe—a self-induced catastrophe, to be sure, but one that 
may be indistinguishable from an “act of God.” Inconveniences 
interfere with the integrity of our plans—so we tend to pretend that 
they are not there. Catastrophes, by contrast, interfere with the 
integrity of our whole stories, and massively dysregulate our 
emotions. By their nature, they are harder to ignore—although that 
does not stop us from trying to do so. 

Inconveniences are common; unfortunately, so are 
catastrophes—self-induced and otherwise. We are adapted to 
catastrophes, like inconveniences, as constant environmental 
features. We can resolve catastrophe, just as we can cope with 
inconvenience—although at higher cost. As a consequence of this 
adaptation, this capacity for resolution, catastrophe can rejuvenate. 

It can also destroy. 

The more ignored inconveniences in a given catastrophe, the 
more likely it will destroy. 

Enough has been learned in the last half-century of inquiry into intellectual and emotional 
function to enable the development of a provisional general theory of emotional 
regulation. Description of the role that reaction to novelty or anomaly plays in human 
information processing is clearly central to such a theory. A compelling body of evidence 
suggests that our affective, cognitive and behavioral responses to the unknown or 
unpredictable are “hard-wired”; suggests that these responses constitute inborn structural 
elements of the processes of consciousness itself. We attend, involuntarily, to those 
things that occur contrary to our predictions—that occur despite our desires, as expressed 
in expectation. That involuntary attention comprises a large part of what we refer to when 
we say “consciousness.” Our initial attention constitutes the first step in the process by 
which we come to adjust our behavior and our interpretive schemas to the world of 
experience—assuming that we do so; constitutes as well the first step we take when we 
modify the world to make it what we desire, instead of what it is currently. 

Modern investigation into the role of novelty in emotion and thought began with the 
Russians—E.N.Sokolov, O.Vinogradova, A.R.Luria (and, more recently, E.Goldberg)— 
who adopted an approach to human function that is in many ways unique. Their tradition 
apparently stems from Pavlov, who viewed the reflex arc as a phenomenon of central 
importance, and from the Marxist intellectual legacy, which regarded work—creative 
action—as the defining feature of man. Whatever the specific historical precedents, it is 
most definitely the case that the Russians have regarded motor output and its abstract 
equivalents as the critically relevant aspect of human existence. This intellectual position 
distinguished them, historically, from their Western counterparts, who tend(ed) to view 



Maps of meaning 22 


the brain as an information-processing machine, akin to the computer. Psychologists in 
the West have concentrated their energies on determining how the brain determines what 
is out there, so to speak, from the objective viewpoint. The Russians, by contrast, have 
devoted themselves to the role of the brain in governing behavior, and in generating the 
affects or emotions associated with that behavior. Modern animal experimentalists—most 
notably Jeffrey Gray 25 —have adopted the Russian line, with striking success. We now 
know, at least in broad outline, how we respond to those (annoying, irritating, 
frightening, promising) things that we do not expect. 

The pioneering Russian psychophysiologist E.N.Sokolov began work on the “reflex 
basis” of attention in the 1950s. By the early ’60s, this work had advanced to the point 
where he could formulate the following key propositions. First: 

One possible approach to analyzing the process of reflection is to consider 
the nervous system as a mechanism which models the external world by 
specific changes that occur in its internal structure. In this sense a distinct 
set of changes in the nervous system is isomorphic with the external agent 
that it reflects and resembles. As an internal model that develops in the 
nervous system in response to the effect of agents in the environment, the 
image performs the vital function of modifying the nature of behavior, 
allowing the organism to predict events and actively adjust to its 
environment. 26 

And second: 

My first encounter with phenomena which indicated that the higher 
divisions of the central nervous system form models of external agents 
involved the study of reactions to “novel” [stimulus features. I 
characterized these reactions as] orienting reflexes. The peculiar feature of 
the orienting reflex is that after several applications of the same stimulus 
(generally five to fifteen) the response disappears (or, as the general 
expression goes, “is extinguished”). However, the slightest possible 
change in the stimulus is sufficient to awaken the response.... Research 
on the orienting reflex indicates that it does not occur as a direct result of 
incoming excitation; rather, it is produced by signals of discrepancy which 
develop when afferent [that is, incoming ] signals are compared with the 
trace formed in the nervous system by an earlier signal. 27 

Sokolov was concerned primarily with the modeling of events in the objective external 
world—assuming, essentially, that when we model, we model facts. Most of the scholars 
who have followed his lead have adopted this central assumption, at least implicitly. This 
position requires some modification. We do model facts, but we concern ourselves with 
valence, or value. It is therefore the case that our maps of the world contain what might 
be regarded as two distinct types of information: sensory and affective. It is not enough to 
know that something is. It is equally necessary to know what it signifies. It might even be 
argued that animals—and human beings—are primarily concerned with the affective or 
emotional significance of the environment. 



Maps of Meaning 23 


Along with our animal cousins, we devote ourselves to fundamentals: will this (new) 
thing eat me? Can I eat it? Will it chase me? Should I chase it? Can I mate with it? We 
may construct models of “objective reality,” and it is no doubt useful to do so. We must 
model meanings, however, in order to survive. Our most fundamental maps of 
meaning—maps which have a narrative structure—portray the motivational value of our 
current state, conceived of in contrast to a hypothetical ideal, accompanied by plans of 
action, which are our pragmatic notions about how to get what we want. 

Description of these three elements—current state, ideal future state, and means of 
active mediation—constitute the necessary and sufficient preconditions for the weaving 
of the most simple narrative, which is a means for describing the valence of a given 
environment, in reference to a temporally and spatially bounded set of action patterns. 
Getting to point “b” presupposes that you are at point “a”—you can’t plan movement in 
the absence of an initial position. The fact that point “b” constitutes the end goal means 
that it is valenced more high-ly than point “a”—that it is a place more desirable, when 
considered against the necessary contrast of the current position. It is the perceived 
improvement of point “b” that makes the whole map meaningful or affect-laden; it is the 
capacity to construct hypothetical or abstract end points, such as “b”—and to contrast 
them against “the present”—that makes human beings capable of using their cognitive 
systems to modulate their affective reactions." 8 

The domain mapped by a functional narrative (one that, when enacted, produces the 
results desired) might reasonably be regarded as “explored territory,” as events that occur 
“there” are predictable. Any place where enacted plans produce unexpected, threatening 
or punishing consequences, by contrast, might be regarded as “unexplored territory.” 
What happens “there” does not conform to our wishes. This means that a familiar place, 
where unpredictable things start happening, is no longer familiar (even though it might be 
the same place with regards to its strict spatial location, from the “objective” 
perspective). We know how to act in some places, and not in others. The plans we put 
into action sometimes work, and sometimes do not work. The experiential domains we 
inhabit—our “environments,” so to speak—are therefore permanently characterized by 
the fact of the predictable and controllable, in juxtaposition with the unpredictable and 
uncontrollable. The universe is composed of “order” and “chaos”—at least from the 
metaphorical perspective. Oddly enough, however, it is to this “metaphorical” universe 
that our nervous system appears to have adapted. 

What Sokolov discovered, to put it bluntly, is that human beings (and other animals 
far down the phylogenetic chain) are characterized by an innate response to what they 
cannot predict, do not want, and cannot understand. Sokolov identified the central 
characteristics of how we respond to the unknown—to the strange category of all events 
that have not yet been categorized. The notion that we respond in an “instinctively 
patterned” manner to the appearance of the unknown has profound implications. These 
can best be first encountered in narrative form.

You work in an office; you are climbing the corporate ladder. Your daily activity reflects 
this superordinate goal. You are constantly immersed in one activity or another designed 
to produce an elevation in your status from the perspective of the corporate hierarchy. 
Today, you have to attend a meeting that may prove vitally important to your future. You 
have an image in your head, so to speak, about the nature of that meeting and the 
interactions that will characterize it. You imagine what you would like to accomplish. 
Your image of this potential future is a fantasy, but it is based, insofar as you are honest, 
on all the relevant information derived from past experience that you have at your 
disposal. You have attended many meetings. You know what is likely to happen, during 
any given meeting, within reasonable bounds; you know how you will behave, and what 
effect your behavior will have on others. Your model of the desired future is clearly 
predicated on what you currently know. 

You also have a model of the present, constantly operative. You understand your 
(somewhat subordinate) position within the corporation, which is your importance 
relative to others above and below you in the hierarchy. You understand the significance 
of those experiences that occur regularly while you are during your job: you know who 
you can give orders to, who you have to listen to, who is doing a good job, who can 
safely be ignored, and so on. You are always comparing this present (unsatisfactory) 
condition to that of your ideal, which is you, increasingly respected, powerful, rich and 
happy, free of anxiety and suffering, climbing toward your ultimate success. You are 
unceasingly involved in attempts to transform the present, as you currently understand it, 
into the future, as you hope it will be. Your actions are designed to produce your ideal— 
designed to transform the present into something ever more closely resembling what you 
want. Your are confident in your model of reality, in your story; when you put it into 
action, you get results. 

You prepare yourself mentally for your meeting. You envision yourself playing a 
centrally important role—resolutely determining the direction the meeting will take, 
producing a powerful impact on your co-workers. You are in your office, preparing to 
leave. The meeting is taking place in another building, several blocks away. You 
formulate provisional plans of behavior designed to get you there on time. You estimate 
travel time at fifteen minutes. 

You leave your office on the twenty-seventh floor, and you wait by the elevator. The 
minutes tick by—more and more of them. The elevator fails to appear. You had not taken 
this possibility into account. The longer you wait, the more nervous you get. Your heart 
rate starts increasing, as you prepare for action (action unspecified, as of yet). Your palms 
sweat. You flush. You berate yourself for failing to consider the potential impact of such 
a delay. Maybe you are not as smart as you think you are. You begin to revise your model 
of yourself. No time for that now: you put such ideas out of your head and concentrate on 
the task at hand. 

The unexpected has just become manifest—in the form of the missing elevator. You 
planned to take it to get where you were going; it did not appear. Your original plan of 
action is not producing the effects desired. It was, by your own definition, a bad plan. You 
need another one—and quickly. Luckily you have an alternate strategy at your disposal. 
The stairs! You dash to the rear of the building. You try the door to the stairwell. It is 
locked. You curse the maintenance staff. You are frustrated and anxious. The unknown 
has emerged once again. You try another exit. Success! The door opens. Hope springs

forth from your breast. You still might make it on time. You rush down the stairs—all 
twenty-seven floors—and onto the street. 

You are, by now, desperately late. As you hurry along, you monitor your 
surroundings: is progress toward your goal continuing? Anyone who gets in your way 
inconveniences you—elderly women, playful, happy children, lovers out for a stroll. You 
are a good person, under most circumstances—at least in your own estimation. Why, 
then, do these innocent people aggravate you so thoroughly? You near a busy 
intersection. The crosswalk light is off. You fume and mutter away stupidly on the 
sidewalk. Your blood pressure rises. The light finally changes. You smile and dash 
forward. Up a slight rise you run. You are not in great physical shape. Where did all this 
energy come from? You are approaching the target building. You glance at your watch. 
Five minutes left: no problem. A feeling of relief and satisfaction floods you. You are 
there; in consequence, you are not an idiot. If you believed in God, you would thank 
Him. 

Had you been early—had you planned appropriately—the other pedestrians and 
assorted obstacles would not have affected you at all. You might have even appreciated 
them—at least the good-looking ones—or may at least not have classified them as 
obstacles. Maybe you would have even used the time to enjoy your surroundings 
(unlikely) or to think about other issues of real importance—like tomorrow’s meeting. 

You continue on your path. Suddenly, you hear a series of loud noises behind you— 
noises reminiscent of a large motorized vehicle hurtling over a small concrete barrier 
(much like a curb). You are safe on the sidewalk—or so you presumed a second ago. 
Your meeting fantasies vanish. The fact that you are late no longer seems relevant. You 
stop hurrying along, instantly, arrested in your path by the emergence of this new 
phenomenon. Your auditory system localizes the sounds in three dimensions. You 
involuntarily orient your trunk, neck, head and eyes toward the place in space from which 
the sounds apparently emanate.’ 1 Your pupils dilate, and your eyes widen. ’ 2 Your heart 
rate speeds up, as your body prepares to take adaptive action—once the proper path of 
that action has been specified. 3 ’ 

You actively explore the unexpected occurrence, once you have oriented yourself 
toward it, with all the sensory and cognitive resources you can muster. You are 
generating hypotheses about the potential cause of the noise even before you turn. Has a 
van jumped the curb? The image flashes through your mind. Has something heavy fallen 
from a building? Has the wind overturned a billboard or street sign? Your eyes actively 
scan the relevant area. You see a truck loaded with bridge parts heading down the street, 
just past a pothole in the road. The mystery is solved. You have determined the specific 
motivational significance of what just seconds ago was the dangerous and threatening 
unknown, and it is zero. A loaded truck hit a bump. Big deal! Your heart slows down. 
Thoughts of the impending meeting re-enter the theater of your mind. Your original 
journey continues as if nothing has happened. 

What is going on? Why are you frightened and frustrated by the absence of the 
expected elevator, the presence of the old woman with the cane, the carefree lovers, the 
loud machinery? Why are you so emotionally and behaviorally variable? 

Detailed description of the processes governing these common affective occurrences 
provides the basis for proper understanding of human motivation. What Sokolov and his 
colleagues essentially discovered was that the unknown, experienced in relationship to 



Maps of meaning 


26 


your currently extant model of present and future, has a priori motivational 
significance—or, to put it somewhat differently, that the unknown could serve as an 
uncondiHoned stimulus. 

What is the a priori motivational significance of the unknown? Can such a question 
even be asked? After all, the unknown by definition has not yet been explored. Nothing 
can be said, by the dictates of standard logic, about something that has not yet been 
encountered. We are not concerned with sensory information, however—nor with 
particular material attributes—but with valence. Valence, in and of itself, might be most 
simply considered as bipolar: negative or positive (or, of course, as neither). We are 
familiar enough with the ultimate potential range of valence, negative and positive, to 
place provisional borders around possibility. The worst the unknown could be, in general, 
is death (or, perhaps, lengthy suffering followed by death); the fact of our vulnerable 
mortality provides the limiting case. The best the unknown could be is more difficult to 
specify, but some generalizations might prove acceptable. We would like to be wealthy 
(or at least free from want), possessed of good health, wise and well-loved. The greatest 
good the unknown might confer, then, might be regarded as that which would allow us to 
transcend our innate limitations (poverty, ignorance, vulnerability), rather than to remain 
miserably subject to them. The emotional “area” covered by the unknown is therefore 
very large, ranging from that which we fear most to that which we desire most intently. 

The unknown is, of course, defined in contradistinction to the known. Everything not 
understood or not explored is unknown. The relationship between the oft- (and unfairly) 
separated domains of “cognition” and “emotion” can be more clearly comprehended in 
light of this rather obvious fact. It is the absence of an expected satisfaction, for example, 
that is punishing, hurtful 34 —the emotion is generated as a default response to sudden and 
unpredictable alteration in the theoretically comprehended structure of the world. It is the 
man expecting a raise because of his outstanding work—the man configuring a desired 
future on the basis of his understanding of the present—who is hurt when someone “less 
deserving” is promoted before him (“one is best punished,” after all, “for one’s 
virtues” 35 ). The man whose expectations have been dashed—who has been threatened 
and hurt—is likely to work less hard in the future, with more resentment and anger. 
Conversely, the child who has not completed her homework is thrilled when the bell 
signaling class end rings, before she is called upon. The bell signals the absence of an 
expected punishment, and therefore induces positive affect, relief, happiness. 36 

It appears, therefore, that the image of a goal (a fantasy about the nature of the desired 
future, conceived of in relationship to a model of the significance of the present) provides 
much of the framework determining the motivational significance of ongoing current 
events. The individual uses his or her knowledge to construct a hypothetical state of 
affairs, where the motivational balance of ongoing events is optimized: where there is 
sufficient satisfaction, minimal punishment, tolerable threat and abundant hope, all 
balanced together properly over the short and longer terms. This optimal state of affairs 
might be conceptualized as a pattern of career advancement, with a long-term state in 
mind, signifying perfec-tion, as it might be attained profanely (richest drug dealer, 
happily married matron, chief executive officer of a large corporation, tenured Harvard 
professor). Alternatively, perfection might be regarded as the absence of all unnecessary 
things, and the pleasures of an ascetic life. The point is that some desirable tuture state of 
affairs is conceptualized in fantasy and used as a target point for operation in the present. 



Maps of Meaning 27 


Such operations may be conceived of as links in a chain (with the end of the chain 
anchored to the desirable future state). 

A meeting (like the one referred to previously) might be viewed by those participating 
in it as one link in the chain which hypothetically leads to the paradisal state of corporate 
chief executive officer (or to something less desirable but still good). The (well-brought- 
off) meeting, as subgoal, would therefore have the same motivational significance as the 
goal, although at lesser intensity (as it is only one small part of a large and more 
important whole). The exemplary’ meeting will be conceptualized in the ideal—like all 
target states—as a dynamic situation where, all things considered, motivational state is 
optimized. The meeting is imagined, a representation of the desired outcome is 
formulated, and a plan of behavior designed to bring about that outcome is elaborated and 
played out. The “imagined meeting” is fantasy, but fantasy based on past knowledge 
(assuming that knowledge has in fact been generated, and that the planner is able and 
willing to use it). 

The affective systems that govern response to punishment, satisfaction, threat and 
promise all have a stake in attaining the ideal outcome. Anything that interferes with such 
attainment (little old ladies with canes) will be experienced as threatening and/or 
punishing; anything that signifies increased likelihood of success (open stretches of 
sidewalk) will be experienced as promising' 7 or satisfying. It is for this reason that the 
Buddhists believe that everything is Maya, or illusion:’ 8 the motivational significance of 
ongoing events is clearly determined by the nature of the goal toward which behavior is 
devoted. That goal is conceptualized in episodic imagery—in fantasy. We constantly 
compare the world at present to the world idealized in fantasy, render affective judgment, 
and act in consequence. Trivial promises and satisfactions indicate that we are doing 
well, are progressing toward our goals. An unexpected opening in the flow of pedestrians 
appears before us, when we are in a hurry; we rush forward, pleased at the occurrence. 
We get somewhere a little faster than we had planned and feel satisfied with our 
intelligent planning. Profound promises or satisfactions, by contrast, validate our global 
conceptualizations—indicate that our emotions are likely to stay regulated on the path we 
have chosen. Trivial threats or punishments indicate flaws in our means of attaining 
desired ends. We modify our behavior accordingly and eliminate the threat. When the 
elevator does not appear at the desired time, we take the stairs. When a stoplight slows us 
down, we run a bit faster, once it shuts off, than we might have otherwise. Profound 
threats and punishments (read: trauma) have a qualitatively different nature. Profound 
threats or punishments undermine our ability to believe that our conceptualizations of the 
present are valid and that our goals are appropriate. Such occurrences disturb our belief 
in our ends (and, not infrequently, in our starting points). 

We construct our idealized world, in fantasy, according to all the information we have 
at our disposal. We use what we know to build an image of what we could have and, 
therefore, 



Maps of meaning 28 



Figure 3: Normal Life 

of what we should do. But we compare our interpretation of the world as it unfolds in the 
present to the desired world, in imagination, not to mere expectation; we compare what 
we have (in interpretation) to what we want, rather than to what we merely think will be. 
Our goal setting, and consequent striving, is motivated: we chase what we desire, in our 
constant attempts to optimize our affective states. (Of course, we use our behavior to 
ensure that our dreams come true; that is healthy “adaptation.” But we still compare what 
is happening to what we want—to what we desire to be—not merely to what we cold¬ 
bloodedly expect.) 

The maps that configure our motivated behavior have a certain comprehensible 
structure. They contain two fundamental and mutually interdependent poles, one present, 
the other future. The present is sensory experience as it is currently manifested to us—as 
we currently understand it—granted motivational significance according to our current 
knowledge and desires. The future is an image or partial image of perfection, to which we 
compare the present, insofar as we understand its significance. Wherever there exists a 
mismatch between the two, the unexpected or novel occurs (by definition), grips our 
attention, and activates the intrapsychic systems that govern fear and hope. 39 We strive to 
bring novel occurrences back into the realm of predictability or to exploit them for 
previously unconsidered potential by altering our behavior or our patterns of 
representation. We conceive of a path connecting present to future. This path is 
“composed” of the behaviors required to produce the transformations we desire— 
required to turn the (eternally) insufficient present into the (ever-receding) paradisal 
future. This path is normally conceived of as linear, so to speak, as something analogous 





Maps of Meaning 29 


to Thomas Kuhn’s notion of normal science, wherein known patterns of behavior 
operating upon an understood present will produce a future whose desirability is an 
unquestioned given. 40 

Anything that interferes with our potential means to a specified end is punishing or 
threatening, in the rather trivial sense described previously. Encounter with punishments 
or threats of this category merely oblige us to choose an alternative mean from among the 
number we generally have present. A similar situation obtains for promises and 
satisfactions. When a means produces the end desired (or furthers progress along that 
path) we experience satisfaction (and hope—as an interim end accomplished also 
signifies increased likelihood of success, farther out in the future). Such satisfaction 
brings our particular behaviors to an end; we switch goals and continue into the future. 
Modification of our means, as a consequence of the motivational significance of the 
outcomes of those means, might be considered normal adaptation. The structure of 
normal adaptation is schematically portrayed in Figure 3: Normal Life. We posit a goal, 
in image and word, and we compare present conditions to that goal. We evaluate the 
significance of ongoing events in light of their perceived relationship to the goal. We 
modify our behavioral outputs—our means—when necessary, to make the attainment of 
our goal ever more likely. We modify our actions within the game but accept the rules 
without question. We move in a linear direction from present to future. 


Revolutionary Life 

The revolutionary model of adaptation—again, considered akin to Kuhn’s revolutionary> 
science 41 —is more complex. Let us presume that you return from your meeting. You 
made it on time and, as far as you could tell, everything proceeded according to plan. 
You noticed that your colleagues appeared a little irritated and confused by your behavior 
as you attempted to control the situation, but you put this down to jealousy on their 
part—to their inability to comprehend the majesty of your conceptualizations. You are 
satisfied, in consequence—satisfied temporarily—so you start thinking about tomorrow, 
as you walk back to work. You return to your office. There is a message on your 
answering machine. The boss wants to see you. You did not expect this. Your heart rate 
speeds up a little: good or bad, this news demands preparation for action , 42 What does 
she want? Fantasies of potential future spring up. Maybe she heard about your behavior 
at the meeting and wants to congratulate you on your excellent work. You walk to her 
office, apprehensive but hopeful. 

You knock and stroll in jauntily. The boss looks at you and glances away somewhat 
unhappily. Your sense of apprehension increases. She motions for you to sit, so you do. 
What is going on? She says, “I have some bad news for you.” This is not good. This is 
not what you wanted. Your heart rate is rising unpleasantly. You focus all of your 
attention on your boss. “Look,” she says, “I have received a number of very unfavorable 
reports regarding your behavior at meetings. All of your colleagues seem to regard you as 
a rigid and overbearing negotiator. Furthermore, it has become increasingly evident that 
you are unable to respond positively to feedback about your shortcomings. Finally, you 
do not appear to properly understand the purpose of your job or the function of this 
corporation.” 



Maps of meaning 30 


You are shocked beyond belief, paralyzed into immobility. Your vision of the future 
with this company vanishes, replaced by apprehensions of unemployment, social disgrace 
and failure. You find it difficult to breathe. You flush and perspire profusely; your face is 
a mask of barely suppressed horror. You cannot believe that your boss is such a bitch. 
“You have been with us for five years,” she continues, “and it is obvious that your 
performance is not likely to improve. You are definitely not suited for this sort of career, 
and you are interfering with the progress of the many competent others around you. In 
consequence, we have decided to terminate your contract with us, effective immediately. 
If I were you, I would take a good look at myself.” 

You have just received unexpected information, but of a different order of magnitude 
than the petty anomalies, irritations, threats and frustrations that disturbed your 
equilibrium in the morning. You have just been presented with incontrovertible evidence 
that your characterizations of the present and of the ideal future are seriously, perhaps 
irreparably, flawed. Your presumptions about the nature of the world are in error. The 
world you know has just crumbled around you. Nothing is what it seemed; everything is 
unexpected and new again. You leave the office in shock. In the hallway, other 
employees avert their gaze from you, in embarrassment. Why did you not see this 
coming? How could you have been so mistaken in your judgment? 

Maybe everyone is out to get you. 

Better not think that. 

You stumble home, in a daze, and collapse on the couch. You can’t move. You are 
hurt and terrified. You feel like you might go insane. Now what? How will you face 
people? The comfortable, predictable, rewarding present has vanished. The future has 
opened up in front of you like a pit, and you have fallen in. For the next month, you find 
yourself unable to act. Your spirit has been extinguished. You sleep and wake at odd 
hours; your appetite is disturbed. You are anxious, hopeless and aggressive, at 
unpredictable intervals. You snap at your family and torture yourself. Suicidal thoughts 
enter the theater of your imagination. You do not know what to think or what to do: you 
are the victim of an internal war of emotion. 

Your encounter with the terrible unknown has shaken the foundations of your 
worldview. You have been exposed, involuntarily, to the unexpected and revolutionary. 
Chaos has eaten your soul. This means that your long-term goals have to be 
reconstructed, and the motivational significance of events in your current environment re¬ 
evaluated—literally revalued. This capacity for complete revaluation, in the light of new 
information, is even more particularly human than the aforementioned capability for 
exploration of the unknown and generation of new information. Sometimes, in the course 
of our actions, we elicit phenomena 



Maps of Meaning 


31 



Figure 4: Revolutionary Adaptation 

whose very existence is impossible, according to our standard methods of construal 
(which are at base a mode of attributing motivational significance to events). Exploration 
of these new phenomena, and integration of our findings into our knowledge, 
occasionally means reconceptualization of that knowledge 4 ' (and consequent re-exposure 
to the unknown, no longer inhibited by our mode of classification). 44 This means that 
simple movement from present to future is occasionally interrupted by a complete 
breakdown and reformulation, a reconstitution of what the present is and what the future 
should be. The ascent of the individual, so to speak, is punctuated by periods of 
dissolution and rebirth. 45 The more general model of human adaptation—conceptualized 
most simply as steady state, breach, crisis, redress 46 —therefore ends up looking like 
Figure 4: Revolutionary Adaptation. The processes of revolutionary adaptation, enacted 
and represented, underlie diverse cultural phenomena ranging from the rites of 
“primitive” initiation 47 to the conceptions of sophisticated religious systems. 48 Indeed, 
our very cultures are erected upon the foundation of a single great story: paradise, 
encounter with chaos, fall and redemption. 

A month after you were fired, a new idea finds its way into your head. Although you 
never let yourself admit it, you didn’t really like your job. You only took it because you 
felt that it was expected of you. You never put your hill effort into it, because you really 
wanted to do something else—something other people thought was risky or foolish. You 
made a bad decision, a long time ago. Maybe you needed this blow, to put you back on 





Maps of meaning 32 


the path. You start imagining a new future—one where you are not so “secure,” maybe, 
but where you are doing what you actually want to do. The possibility of undisturbed 
sleep returns, and you start eating properly again. You are quieter, less arrogant, more 
accepting—except in your weaker moments. Others make remarks, some admiring, some 
envious, about the change they perceive in you. You are a man recovering from a long 
illness—a man reborn. 


NEUROPSYCHOLOGICAL LUNCTION: THE NATURE OF THE 

MIND 

It is reasonable to regard the world, as forum for action, as a “place”—a 
place made up of the familiar, and the unfamiliar, in eternal juxtaposition. 
The brain is actually composed, in large part, of two subsystems, adapted 
for action in that place. The right hemisphere, broadly speaking, responds 
to novelty with caution, and rapid, global hypothesis formation. The left 
hemisphere, by contrast, tends to remain in charge when things—that is, 
explicitly categorized things—are unfolding according to plan. The right 
hemisphere draws rapid, global, valence-based, metaphorical pictures of 
novel things; the left, with its greater capacity for detail, makes such 
pictures explicit and verbal. Thus the exploratory capacity of the brain 
“builds” the world of the familiar (the known), from the world of the 
unfamiliar (the unknown). 

When the world remains known and familiar—that is, when our 
beliefs maintain their validity—our emotions remain under control. 
When the world suddenly transforms itself into something new, 
however, our emotions are dysregulated, in keeping with the 
relative novelty of that transformation, and we are forced to retreat 
or to explore once again. 

The Valence of Things 

“Anyone who considers the basic drives of man...will find that all of 
them have done philosophy at some time—and that every one of them 
would like only too well to represent just itself as the ultimate purpose of 
existence and the legitimate master of all the other drives. For every drive 
wants to be master—and it attempts to philosophize in that spirit.” 49 
“It is true that man was created in order to serve the gods, 
who, first of all, needed to be fed and clothed.” 50 


We can make lists of general goods and bads, which might appear reasonable to others, 
because we tend to make judgments of meaning in relatively standard and predictable 
ways. Food, to take a simple example, is good, assuming it is palatably prepared, while a 
blow on the head is had in direct proportion to its force. The list of general goods and 
bads can be extended with little effort. Water, shelter, warmth and sexual contact are 



Maps of Meaning 33 


good; diseases, droughts, famines and fights are bad. The essential similarities of our 
judgments of meaning can easily lead us to conclude that the goodness or badness of 
things or situations is something more or less fixed. However, the fact of subjective 
interpretation—and its effects on evaluation and behavior—complicate this simple 
picture. We will work, expend energy and overcome obstacles to gain a good (or to avoid 
something bad). But we won’t work for food, at least not very hard, if we have enough 
food; we won’t work for sex, if we are satisfied with our present levels of sexual activity; 
and we might be very pleased to go hungry, if that means our enemy will starve. Our 
predictions, expectations and desires condition our evaluations to a finally unspecifiable 
degree. Things have no absolutely fixed significance, despite our ability to generalize 
about their value. It is our personal preferences, therefore, that determine the import of 
the world (but these preferences have constraints!). 

The meaning we attribute to objects or situations is not stable. What is important to 
one man is not necessarily important to another; likewise, the needs and desires of the 
child differ from those of the adult. The meaning of things depends to a profound and 
ultimately undeterminable degree upon the relationship of those things to the goal we 
currently have in mind. Meaning shifts when goals change. Such change necessarily 
transforms the contingent expectations and desires that accompany those goals. We 
experience “things” personally and idiosyncratically, despite broad interpersonal 
agreement about the value of things. The goals we pursue singly—the outcomes we 
expect and desire as individuals—determine the meaning of our experience. The 
existential psychotherapist Viktor Frankl relates a story from his experiences as a Nazi 
death camp inmate that makes this point most strikingly: 

Take as an example something that happened on our journey from 
Auschwitz to the camp affiliated with Dachau. We became more and more 
tense as we approached a certain bridge over the Danube which the train 
would have to cross to reach Mauthausen, according to the statement of 
experienced traveling companions. Those who have never seen anything 
similar cannot possibly imagine the dance of joy performed in the carriage 
by the prisoners when they saw that our transport was not crossing the 
bridge and was instead heading “only” for Dachau. 

And again, what happened on our arrival in that camp, after a journey 
lasting two days and three nights? There had not been enough room for 
everybody to crouch on the floor of the carriage at the same time. The 
majority of us had to stand all the way, while a few took turns at squatting 
on the scanty straw which was soaked with human urine. When we 
arrived the first important news that we heard from older prisoners was 
that this comparatively small camp (its population was 2,500) had no 
“oven,” no crematorium, no gas! That meant that a person who had 
become a “Moslem” [no longer fit for work] could not be taken straight to 
the gas chamber, but would have to wait until a so-called “sick convoy” 
had been arranged to return to Auschwitz. This joyful surprise put us all in 
a good mood. The wish of the senior warden of our hut in Auschwitz had 
come true: we had come, as quickly as possible, to a camp which did not 



Maps of meaning 34 


have a “chimney”—unlike Auschwitz. We laughed and cracked jokes in 
spite of, and during, all we had to go through in the next few hours. 

When we new arrivals were counted, one of us was missing. So we had 
to wait outside in the rain and cold wind until the missing man was found. 

He was at last discovered in a hut, where he had fallen asleep from 
exhaustion. Then the roll call was turned into a punishment parade. All 
through the night and late into the next morning, we had to stand outside, 
frozen and soaked to the skin after the strain of our long journey. And yet 
we were all very pleased! There was no chimney in this camp and 
Auschwitz was a long way off. 51 

Nothing produces terror and fear like a concentration camp—unless the camp 
encountered is better than the camp expected. Our hopes, desires and wishes—which are 
always conditional—define the context within which the things and situations we 
encounter take on determinate significance; define even the context within which we 
understand “thing” or “situation.” We presume that things have a more or less fixed 
meaning, because we share a more or less fixed “condition” with others—at least with 
those others who are familiar to us, who share our presumptions and worldviews. Those 
(culturally determined) things we take for granted—and which are, therefore, invisible— 
determine our affective responses to “environmental stimuli.” We assume that such 
things are permanent attributes of the world; but they are not. Our situations—and, 
therefore, our “contexts of interpretation”—can change dramatically, at any moment. We 
are indeed fortunate (and, generally, oblivious of that fortune) when they do not. 

It is not possible to finally determine how or whether something is meaningful by 
observing the objective features of that thing. Value is not invariant, in contrast to 
objective reality; furthermore, it is not possible to derive an ought from an is (this is the 
“naturalistic fallacy” of David Hume). It is possible, however, to determine the 
conditional meaning of something, by observing how behavior (one’s own behavior, or 
someone else’s) is conducted in the presence of that thing (or in its absence). “Things” 
(objects, processes) emerge—into subjective experience, at least—as a consequence of 
behaviors. Let us say, for the sake of example, that behavior “a” produces phenomenon 
“b” (always remembering that we are talking about behavior in a particular context). 
Behavior “a” consequently increases in frequency. It can be deduced, then, that 
phenomenon “b” is regarded as positive, by the agent under observation, in the particular 
“context” constituting the observed situation. If behavior “a” decreases in frequency, the 
opposite conclusion can be reasonably reached. The observed agent regards “b” as 
negative. 

The behavioral psychologist B.F.Skinner originally defined a reinforcer as a stimulus 
which produced a change in the frequency of a given behavior. 5 " He was loathe to 
become concerned with the internal or intrapsychic whys and wherefores of 
reinforcement, preferring instead to work by definition. If a stimulus increased the rate at 
which a given behavior was manifested, it was positive. If it decreased the rate of that 
behavior, it was negative. Of course, Skinner recognized that the valence of a given 
stimulus was context-dependent. An animal had to be “food-deprived” (in normal 
parlance, hungry ;) before food could serve as a positive reinforcer. And as the animal 



Maps of Meaning 35 


being fed became less food-deprived, the valence and potency of the reinforcer food 
decreased. 

Skinner believed that discussions of an animal’s (or a human’s) internal state were 
unnecessary. If you knew an animal’s reinforcement history, you could determine what 
“stimuli” were likely to have positive or negative valence. The fundamental problem with 
this argument is one of parsimony. It is impossible to know an animal’s “reinforcement 
history”—particularly if that animal is as complex and long-lived as a human being. This 
is tantamount to saying, “you must know everything that has ever happened to that 
animal”; analogous to the old determinist claim that “if you knew the present position and 
momentum of every particle in the universe, you could determine all future positions and 
momenta.” You can’t know all present positions and momenta: the measurement 
problems are insurmountable, and the uncertainty principle makes it impossible anyway. 
Likewise, you don’t have access to the “reinforcement history,” and even if you did, 
measuring it would alter it. (I am not making an formal “uncertainty” claim for 
psychology; just drawing what I hope is a useful analogy). 

Skinner addressed this problem by limiting his concern to experimental situations so 
simple that only immediate reinforcement history played a context-determining role. This 
“implicit” limit enabled him to sidestep the fundamental issue, and to make inappropriate 
generalizations. It didn’t matter how a rat related to his mother six months earlier if you 
could make him “food-deprived” enough. The (short-term) fact of the food deprivation, 
for example, overrode individual rat differences—at least in the experimental condition 
under question—and could therefore usefully be ignored. Similarly, if you starve human 
beings, you can be reasonably sure that they will become concerned with food. However, 
even in this extreme case, you cannot predict how this concern will manifest itself, or 
what (ethical) considerations might play an intermediate, or even determining, role. 
Alexander Solzhenitsyn examined this very problem during the time he spent in the 
Soviet “Gulag Archipelago” (the Soviet prison camp system): 

At the Samarka Camp in 1946 a group of intellectuals had reached the 
very brink of death: They were worn down by hunger, cold, and work 
beyond their powers. And they were even deprived of sleep. They had 
nowhere to lie down. Dugout barracks had not yet been built. Did they go 
and steal? Or squeal? Or whimper about their ruined lives? No! 
Foreseeing the approach of death in days rather than weeks, here is how 
they spent their last sleepless leisure, sitting up against the wall: 
Timofeyev-Ressovsky gathered them into a “seminar,” and they hastened 
to share with one another what one of them knew and the others did not— 
they delivered their last lectures to each other. Father Savely—spoke of 
“unshameful death,” a priest academician—about patristics, one of the 
Uniate fathers—about something in the area of dogmatics and canonical 
writings, an electrical engineer—on the principles of the energetics of the 
future, and a Leningrad economist—on how the effort to create principles 
of Soviet economics had failed for lack of new ideas. From one session to 
the next, participants were missing—they were already in the morgue. 

That is the sort of person who can be interested in all this while already 
growing numb with approaching death—now that is an intellectual! 53 



Maps of meaning 36 


Past experience—learning—does not merely condition ; rather, such experience 
determines the precise nature of the framework of reference or context that will be 
brought to bear on the analysis of a given situation. This cognitive frame of reference acts 
as the intermediary between past learning, present experience and future desire. This 
intermediary is a valid object of scientific exploration—a phenomenon as real as anything 
abstracted is real—and is far more parsimonious and accessible, as such a phenomenon, 
than the simple noninterpreted (and nonmeasurable, in any case) sum total of 
reinforcement history. Frameworks of reference, influenced in their structure by learning, 
specify the valence of ongoing experience; determine what might be regarded, in a given 
time and place, as good, bad or indifferent. Furthermore, inferences about the nature of 
the framework of reference governing the behavior of others (that is, looking at the world 
through the eyes of another) may produce results that are more useful, more broadly 
generalizable (as “insights” into the “personality” of another), and less demanding of 
cognitive resources than attempts to understand the details of a given reinforcement 
history. 

Valence can be positive or negative, as the early behaviorists noted. Positive and 
negative are not opposite ends of a continuum, however—not in any straightforward 
way. 54 The two “states” appear orthogonal, although (perhaps) mutually inhibitory. 
Furthermore, positive and negative are not simple: each can be subdivided, in a more or 
less satisfactory manner, at least once. Positively valued things, for example, can be 
satisfying or promising (can serve as consummately or incentive rewards, respectively 55 ). 
Many satisfying things are consumable, in the literal sense, as outlined previously. Food, 
for example, is a consummatory reward to the hungry—which means that it is valued 
under such circumstances as a satisfaction. Likewise, water satisfies the individual 
deprived of liquid. Sexual contact is rewarding to the lustful, and warmth is desirable to 
those without shelter. Sometimes more complex stimuli are satisfying or rewarding as 
well. It all depends on what is presently desired, and how that desire plays itself out. A 
mild verbal reprimand might well foster feelings of relief in the individual who expects a 
severe physical beating—which is to say, technically, that the absence of an expected 
punishment can serve quite effectively as a reward (it is in fact the form of reward that 
the tyrant prefers). Regardless of their form, attained satisfactions produce satiation, calm 
and somnolent pleasure, and (temporary) cessation of the behaviors directed to that 
particular end—although behaviors that culminate in a satisfactory conclusion are more 
likely to be manifested, in the future, when “instinctive” or “voluntary” desire re- 
emerges. 

Promises, which are also positive, might be regarded as more abstractly meaningful 
than satisfactions, as they indicate potential rather than actuality. Promises—cues of 
consummatory rewards or satisfactions—indicate the imminent attainment of something 
desired or potentially desirable. Their more abstract quality does not make them 
secondary or necessarily learned, however, as was once thought; our response to 
potential satisfaction is often as basic or primary as our response to satisfaction itself. 
Promises (cues of satisfaction) have been regarded, technically, as incentive rewards, 
because they induce forward locomotion — which is merely movement toward the place 
that the cue indicates satisfaction will occur. 56 Curiosity, 57 hope 58 and excited pleasure 
tend to accompany exposure to cues of reward (and are associated with subsequent 



Maps of Meaning 37 


forward locomotion). 59 Behaviors that produce promises—like those that result in 
satisfactions—also increase in frequency, over time. 60 

Negatively valued things—which have a structure that mirrors that of their positive 
counterparts—can either be punishing or threatening . 61 Punishments—a diverse group of 
stimuli or contexts, as defined immediately below—all appear to share one feature (at 
least from the perspective of the theory outlined in this manuscript): they indicate the 
temporary or final impossibility of implementing one or more means or attaining one or 
more ends. Some stimuli are almost universally experienced as punishing, because their 
appearance indicates reduced likelihood of carrying through virtually any imaginable 
plan—of obtaining almost every satisfaction, or potential desirable future. Most things or 
situations that produce bodily injury fall into this category. More generally, punishments 
might be conceived of as involuntary states of deprivation (of food, water, optimal 
temperature, 62 or social contact 63 ); as disappointments 64 or frustrations 65 (which are 
absences of expected rewards 66 ), and as stimuli sufficiently intense to produce damage to 
the systems encountering them. Punishments stop action, or induce retreat or escape 
(backward locomotion), 67 and engender the emotional state commonly known as pain or 
hurt. Behaviors, which culminate in punishment and subsequent hurt, tend to 
extinguish —to decrease in frequency, over time. 68 

Threats, which are also negative, indicate potential, like promises—but potential for 
punishment, for hurt, for pain. Threats—cues of punishment—are stimuli that indicate 
enhanced likelihood of punishment and hurt. 69 Threats are abstract, like promises; 
however, like promises, they are not necessarily secondary’ or learned. 10 Unexpected 
phenomena, for example—which constitute innately recognizable threats—stop us in our 
tracks, and make us feel anxiety. 11 So, arguably, do certain innate fear stimuli—like 
snakes. 72 Behaviors that culminate in the production of cues of punishment—that create 
situations characterized by anxiety—tend to decrease in frequency over time (much like 
those that produce immediate punishment). 7 ' 

Satisfactions and their cues are good, simply put; punishments and threats are bad. We 
tend to move forward 74 (to feel hope, curiosity, joy) and then to consume (to make love, 
to eat, to drink) in the presence of good things; and to pause (and feel anxious), then 
withdraw, move backwards (and feel pain, disappointment, frustration, loneliness) when 
faced by things we do not like. In the most basic of situations—when we know what we 
are doing, when we are engaged with the familiar—these fundamental tendencies suffice. 
Our actual situations, however, are almost always more complex. If things or situations 
were straightforwardly or simply positive or negative, good or bad, we would not have to 
make judgments regarding them, would not have to think about our behavior, and how 
and when it should be modified—indeed, would not have to think at all. We are faced, 
however, with the constant problem of ambivalence in meaning, which is to say that a 
thing or situation might be bad and good simultaneously (or good in two conflicting 
manners; or bad, in two conflicting manners). 75 A cheesecake, for example, is good when 
considered from the perspective of food deprivation or hunger, but bad when considered 
from the perspective of social desirability and the svelte figure that such desirability 
demands. The newly toilet-trained little boy who has just wet his bed might well 
simultaneously feel satisfaction at the attainment of a biologically vital goal and 
apprehension as to the likely socially constructed interpersonal consequence of that 
satisfaction. Nothing comes without a cost, and the cost has to be factored in, when the 



Maps of meaning 38 


meaning of something is evaluated. Meaning depends on context; contexts—stories, in a 
word—constitute goals, desires, wishes. It is unfortunate, from the perspective of 
conflict-free adaptation, that we have many goals—many stories, many visions of the 
ideal future—and that the pursuit of one often interferes with our chances (or someone 
else’s chances) of obtaining another. 

We solve the problem of contradictory meanings by interpreting the value of things 
from within the confines of our stories—which are adjustable maps of experience and 
potential, whose specific contents are influenced by the demands of our physical being. 
Our central nervous systems are made up of many “hard-wired” or automatized 
subsystems, responsible for biological regulation—for maintaining homeostasis of 
temperature, ensuring proper caloric intake, and monitoring levels of plasma carbon 
dioxide (for example). Each of these subsystems has a job to do. If that job is not done 
within a certain variable span of time, the whole game comes to a halt, perhaps 
permanently. Nothing gets accomplished then. We must therefore perform certain actions 
if we are to survive. This does not mean, however, that our behaviors are determined —at 
least not in any simplistic manner. The subsystems that make up our shared structure— 
responsible, when operative, for our instincts (thirst, hunger, joy, lust, anger, etc.)—do 
not appear to directly grip control of our behavior, do not transform us into driven 
automatons. Rather, they appear to influence our fantasies, our plans, and alter and 
modify the content and comparative importance of our goals, our ideal futures (conceived 
of in comparison to our “unbearable” presents, as they are currently construed). 

Each basic subsystem has its own particular, singular image of what constitutes the 
ideal—the most valid goal at any given moment. If someone has not eaten in several 
days, his vision of the (immediately) desirable future will likely include the image of 
eating. Likewise, if someone has been deprived of water, she is likely to make drinking 
her goal. We share fundamental biological structure, as human beings, so we tend to 
agree, broadly, about what should be regarded as valuable (at least in a specified context). 
What this means, essentially, is that we can make probabilistic estimates about those 
things that a given individual (and a given culture) might regard as desirable, at any 
moment. Furthermore, we can increase the accuracy of our estimates by programmed 
deprivation (because such deprivation specifies interpretive context). Nonetheless, we 
can never be sure, in the complex normal course of events, just what it is that someone 
will want. 

Judgment regarding the significance of things or situations becomes increasingly 
complicated when the fulfillment of one biologically predicated goal interferes with the 
pursuit or fulfillment of another. 76 To what end should we devote our actions, for 
example, when we are simultaneously lustful and guilty, or cold, thirsty and frightened? 
What if the only way to obtain food is to steal it, say, from someone equally hungry, 
weak and dependent? How is our behavior guided when our desires compete—which is 
to say, when wanting one thing makes us likely to lose another or several others? There is 
no reason to presume, after all, that each of our particularly specialized subsystems will 
agree, at any one time, about what constitutes the most immediately desirable “good.” 
This lack of easy agreement makes us intrinsically prone to intrapsychic conflict and 
associated affective (emotional) dysregulation. We manipulate our environments and our 
beliefs to address this conflict—we change ourselves, or the things around us, to increase 
our hope and satisfaction, and to decrease our fear and pain. 



Maps of Meaning 39 


It is up to the “higher” cortical systems—the phylogenetically newer, more 
“advanced” executive 77 portions of the brain—to render judgment about the relative value 
of desired states (and, similarly, to determine the proper order for the manifestation of 
means 78 ). These advanced systems must take all states of desire into account, optimally, 
and determine the appropriate path for the expression of that desire. We make decisions 
about what is to be regarded as valuable, at any given time, but the neurological 
subsystems that keep us alive, which are singularly responsible for our maintenance, in 
different aspects, all have a voice in those decisions—a vote. Every part of us, kingdom 
that we are, depends on the healthy operation of every other part. To ignore one good, 
therefore, is to risk all. To ignore the demands of one necessary subsystem is merely to 
ensure that it will speak later with the voice of the unjustly oppressed; is to ensure that it 
will grip our fantasy, unexpectedly, and make of the future something unpredictable. Our 
“optimal paths” therefore, must be properly inclusive, from the perspective of our internal 
community, our basic physiology. The valuations and actions of others, additionally, 
influence our personal states of emotion and motivation as we pursue our individual 
goals, inevitably, in a social context. The goal, writ large, toward which our higher 
systems work must therefore be construction of a state where all our needs and the needs 
of others are simultaneously met. This higher goal, to which we all theoretically aspire, is 
a complex (and oft-implicit) fantasy—a vision or map of the promised land. This map, 
this story—this framework of reference or context of interpretation —is the (ideal) future, 
contrasted necessarily with the (unbearable) present, and includes concrete plans, 
designed to turn the latter into the former. The mutable meanings that make up our lives 
depend for their nature on the explicit structure of this interpretive context. 

We select what we should value from among those things we must value. Our 
selections are therefore predictable, in the broad sense. This must be, as we must perform 
certain actions in order to live. But the predictability is limited. The world is complex 
enough not only so that a given problem may have many valid solutions, but so that even 
the definition of “solution” may vary. The particular most appropriate or likely choices of 
people, including ourselves, cannot (under normal circumstances, at least) be accurately 
determined beforehand. Nonetheless, despite our final and ineradicable ignorance, we 
act—judging from moment to moment what is to be deemed worthy of pursuit, 
determining what can be ignored, at least temporarily, during that pursuit. We are capable 
of acting and of producing the results we desire because we render judgment of value, 
using every bit of information at our disposal. We determine that something is worth 
having, at a given time and place, and make the possession of that thing our goal. And as 
soon as something has become our goal—no matter what that something is— it appears 
to adopt the significance of satisfaction (of consummatory reward). It appears sufficient 
for something to be truly regarded as valuable for it to adopt the emotional aspect of 
value. It is in this manner that our higher-order verbal-cognitive systems serve to regulate 
our emotions. It is for this reason that we can play or work toward “merely symbolic” 
ends, for this reason that drama and literature 79 (and even sporting events) can have such 
profound vicarious effects on us. The mere fact that something is desired, however, does 
not necessarily mean that its attainment will sustain life (as a “true” satisfaction might)— 
or that pure regard will make something into what it is not. It is therefore necessary (if 
you wish to exist, that is) to construct goals—models of the desired future—that are 
reasonable from the perspective of previous experience, grounded in biological necessity. 



Maps of meaning 40 


Such goals take into account the necessity of coping with our intrinsic limitations; of 
satisfying our inherited biological subsystems; of appeasing those transpersonal “gods,” 
who eternally demand to be clothed and fed. 

The fact that goals should be reasonable does not mean that they have to be or will be 
(at least in the short term)—or that what constitutes “reasonable” can be easily or finally 
determined. One man’s meat is another man’s poison; the contents of the ideal future 
(and the interpreted present) may and do vary dramatically between individuals. An 
anorexic, for example, makes her goal an emaciation of figure that may well be 
incompatible with life. In consequence, she regards food as something to be avoided—as 
something punishing or threatening. This belief will not protect her from starving, 
although it will powerfully affect her short-term determination of the valence of 
chocolate. The man obsessed with power may sacrifice everything—including his 
family—to the attainment of his narrow ambition. The empathic consideration of others, 
a time-consuming business, merely impedes his progress with regard to those things he 
deems of ultimate value. His faith in the value of his progress therefore makes threat and 
frustration even of love. Our beliefs, in short, can change our reactions to everything— 
even to those things as primary or fundamental as food and family. We remain 
indeterminately constrained, however, by the fact of our biological limits. 

It is particularly difficult to specify the value of an occurrence when it has one 
meaning, from one frame of reference (with regard to one particular goal), and a different 
or even opposite meaning, from another equally or more important and relevant frame. 
Stimuli that exist in this manner constitute unsolved problems of adaptation. They 
present us with a mystery, which is what to do in their presence (whether to pause, 
consume, stop, or move backwards or forwards, at the most basic of levels; whether to 
feel anxious, satisfied, hurt or hopeful). Some things or situations may be evidently 
satisfying or punishing, at least from the currently extant “framework of reference,” and 
can therefore be regarded (valued, acted toward) in an uncomplicated manner. Other 
things and situations, however, remain rife with contradictory or indeterminate meanings. 
(Many things, for example, are satisfying or promising in the short term but punishing in 
the medium to long term.) Such circumstances provide evidence that our systems of 
valuation are not yet sophisticated enough to foster complete adaptation—demonstrate to 
us incontrovertibly that our processes of evaluation are still incomplete: 

A brain in a vat is at the wheel of a runaway trolley, approaching a fork in 
the track. The brain is hooked up to the trolley in such a way that the brain 
can determine which course the trolley will take. There are only two 
options: the right side of the fork, or the left side. There is no way to 
derail or stop the trolley, and the brain is aware of this. On the right side 
of the track there is a single railroad worker, Jones, who will definitely be 
killed if the brain steers the trolley to the right. If Jones lives he will go on 
to kill five men for the sake of thirty orphans (one of the five men he will 
kill is planning to destroy a bridge that the orphans’ bus will be crossing 
later that night). One of the orphans who will be killed would have grown 
up to become a tyrant who made good, utilitarian men do bad things, 
another would have become John Sununu, a third would have invented the 
pop-top can. 




Maps of Meaning 41 


If the brain in the vat chooses the left side of the track, the trolley will 
definitely hit and kill another railman, Leftie, and will hit and destroy ten 
beating hearts on the track that would have been transplanted into ten 
patients at the local hospital who will die without donor hearts. These are 
the only hearts available, and the brain is aware of this. If the railman on 
the left side of the track lives, he, too, will kill five men—in fact, the same 
five that the railman on the right would kill. However, Leftie will kill the 
five as an unintended consequence of saving ten men: he will 
inadvertently kill the five men as he rushes the ten hearts to the local 
hospital for transplantation. A further result of Leftie’s act is that the 
busload of orphans will be spared. Among the five men killed by Leftie is 
the man responsible for putting the brain at the controls of the trolley. If 
the ten hearts and Leftie are killed by the trolley, the ten prospective heart- 
transplant patients will die and their kidneys will be used to save the lives 
of twenty kidney transplant patients, one of whom will grow up to cure 
cancer and one of whom will grow up to be Hitler. There are other 
kidneys and dialysis machines available, but the brain does not know this. 

Assume that the brains choice, whatever it turns out to be, will serve as 
an example to other brains in vats, and thus the effects of its decision will 
be amplified. Also assume that if the brain chooses the right side of the 
fork, an unjust war free of war crimes will ensue, whereas if the brain 
chooses the left fork, a just war fraught with war crimes will result. 
Furthermore, there is an intermittently active Cartesian demon deceiving 
the brain in such a way that the brain is never sure that it is being 
deceived. 

Question: Ethically speaking, what should the brain do? 80 

We cannot act in two ways at one time—cannot move forwards and backwards, cannot 
stop and go, simultaneously. When faced with stimuli whose meaning is indeterminate 
we are therefore placed in conflict. Such conflict must be resolved, before adaptive action 
may take place. We can actually only do one thing, at one time, although we may be 
motivated by contusing, threatening, dangerous or unpredictable circumstances to 
attempt many incommensurate things simultaneously. 


Unexplored Territory: Phenomenology and Neuropsychology 

The dilemma of contradictory simultaneous meanings can be solved in only two related 
ways (although it can be avoided in many others). We can alter our behaviors, in the 
difficult situation, so that those behaviors no longer produce consequences we do not 
desire or cannot interpret. Alternatively, we can reframe our contexts of evaluation (our 
goals and our interpretations of the present), so that they no longer produce paradoxical 
implications, with regard to the significance of a given situation. These processes of 
behavioral modification and reframing constitute acts of effortful revaluation, which 
means thorough, exploratory reconsideration of what has been judged previously to be 
appropriate or important. 



Maps of meaning 42 


Things or situations with indeterminate meanings therefore challenge our adaptive 
competence; force us to revaluate our present circumstances and alter our ongoing 
behaviors. Such circumstances arise when something we have under control, from one 
perspective, is troublesome or otherwise out of control from another. Out of control 
means, most basically, unpredictable: something is beyond us when our interactions with 
it produce phenomena whose properties could not be determined, beforehand. 
Unexpected or novel occurrences, which emerge when our plans do not turn out the way 
we hope they would, therefore constitute an important—perhaps the most important— 
subset of the broader class of stimuli of indeterminate meaning. Something unexpected, 
or novel, necessarily occurs in relationship to what is known; is always identified and 
evaluated with respect to our currently operative plan [which is to say that a familiar 
thing in an unexpected place (or at an unexpected time) is actually something unfamiliar]. 
The wife of an adulterous husband, for example, is well-known to him, perhaps, when 
she is at home. The fact of her, and her behavior, constitutes explored territory. She is an 
entirely different sort of phenomenon, however, from the perspective of affect (and 
implication for behavioral output) if she makes an unexpected appearance at his favorite 
motel room, in the midst of a tryst. What will the husband do, in his wife’s presence, 
when she surprises him? First, he will be taken aback, in all likelihood—then he will 
concoct a story that makes sense of his behavior (if he can manage it, on such short 
notice). He has to think up something new, do something he has never done before. He 
has to manage his wife, who he thinks he has fooled—his wife, whose mere unexpected 
presence at the motel is proof of her endless residual mystery. Our habitual patterns of 
action only suffice for things and situations of determinate significance—by definition: 
we only know how to act in the presence of the familiar. The appearance of the 
unexpected pops us out of unconscious, axiomatic complacency and forces us (painfully) 
to think. 

The implications of novel or unpredictable occurrences are unknown, by definition. 
This observation carries within it the seeds of a difficult and useful question: what is the 
significance of the unknown? It might seem logical to assume that the answer is none— 
something unexplored cannot have meaning, because none has yet been attributed to it. 
The truth, however, is precisely opposite. Those things we do not understand nonetheless 
signify. If you can’t tell what something means, because you don’t know what it is, what 
then does it mean? It is not nothing—we are in fact frequently and predictably upset by 
the unexpected. Rather, it could be anything, and that is precisely the crux of the 
problem. Unpredictable things are not irrelevant, prior to the determination of their 
specific meaning. Things we have not yet explored have significance, prior to our 
adaptation to them, prior to our classification of their relevance, prior to our 
determination of their implication for behavior. Things not predicted, not desired, that 
occur while we are carrying out our carefully designed plans—such things come loaded, 
a priori, with meaning, both positive and negative. The appearance of unexpected things 
or situations indicates, at least, that our plans are in error, at some stage of their design— 
in some trivial way, if we are lucky; in some manner that might be devastating to our 
hopes and wishes, to our self-regard, if we are not. 

Unexpected or unpredictable things—novel things, more exactly (the class of novel 
things, most particularly)—have a potentially infinite, unbounded range of significance. 
What does something that might be anything mean? In the extremes, it means, the worst 



Maps of Meaning 43 


that could be (or, at least, the worst you can imagine) and, conversely, the best that could 
be (or the best you can conceive of). Something new might present the possibility for 
unbearable suffering, followed by meaningless death—a threat virtually unbounded in 
significance. That new and apparently minor but nonetheless strange and worrisome ache 
you noticed this morning, for example, while you were exercising, might just signify the 
onset of the cancer that will slowly and painfully kill you. Alternatively, something 
unexpected might signify inconceivable opportunity for expansion of general competence 
and well-being. Your old, boring but secure job unexpectedly disappears. A year later, 
you are doing what you really want to do, and your life is incomparably better. 

An unexpected thing or situation appearing in the course of goal-directed behavior 
constitutes a stimulus that is intrinsically problematic: novel occurrences are, 
simultaneously, cues for punishment (threats) and cues for satisfaction (promises). 81 This 
paradoxical a priori status is represented schematically in Figure 5: The Ambivalent 
Nature of Novelty. Unpredictable things, which have a paradoxical character, 
accordingly activate two antithetical emotional systems, whose mutually inhibitory 
activities provide basic motivation for abstract cognition, whose cooperative endeavor is 
critical to the establishment of permanent memory, and whose physical substrates 
constitute universal elements of the human nervous system. The most rapidly activated 8 ' 
of these two systems governs inhibition of ongoing behavior, cessation of currently goal- 
directed activity; 8 ' the second, equally powerful but somewhat more conservative, 84 
underlies exploration, general behavioral activation 85 and forward locomotion. 86 
Operation of the former appears associated with anxiety, with fear and apprehension, 
with negative affect—universal subjective reactions to the threatening and unexpected. 87 
Operation of the latter, by contrast, appears associated with hope, with curiosity and 
interest, with positive affect—subjective responses to the promising and unexpected. 88 
The process of exploring the emergent unknown is therefore guided by the interplay 
between the emotions of curiosity/hope/excitement on the one hand and anxiety on the 
other—or, to describe the phenomena from another viewpoint, between the different 
motor systems responsible for approach (forward locomotion) and inhibition of ongoing 
behavior. 

The “ambivalent unknown” comes in two “forms,” so to speak (as alluded to earlier). 
“Normal” novelty emerges within the “territory” circumscribed by the choice of a 
particular end-point or goal (which is to say, after getting to specific point “b” has been 
deemed the most important possible activity at this time and in this place). Something 
“normally” novel constitutes an occurrence which leaves the current departure point and 
goal intact, but 



Maps of meaning 


44 



Figure 5: The Ambivalent Nature of Novelty 

indicates that the means of achieving that goal have to be modified. Let us say, for 
example, that you are in your office. You are accustomed to walking down an 
unobstructed hallway to get to the elevator. You are so used to performing this activity 
that you can do it “automatically”—so you often read while walking. One day, while 
reading, you stumble over a chair someone left in the middle of the hallway. This is 
normal novelty. You don’t have to alter your current goal, except in a temporary and 
trivial manner; you are not likely to get too upset by the unexpected obstacle. Getting to 
the elevator is still a real possibility, even within the desired time frame; all you have to 
do is walk around the chair (or move it somewhere else, if you are feeling particularly 
altruistic). Figure 6: Emergence of “Normal Novelty” in the Course of Goal-Directed 
Behavior provides an abstracted representation of this process of trivial adaptation. 

Revolutionary novelty is something altogether different. Sometimes the sudden 
appearance of the unexpected means taking path “b” to grandma’s house, instead of path 
“a.” Sometimes that appearance means emergent doubt about the very existence of 
grandma (think “wolf’ and “Red Riding Hood”). Here is an example: I am sitting alone 
in my office,

Figure 6: Emergence of “Normal Novelty” in the 
Course of Goal-Directed Behavior 

in a high-rise building, alone at night. I suddenly fantasize: “I am going to take the 
elevator down three floors and get something to eat” (more accurately, hunger suddenly 
grips my imagination, and uses it for its own purposes). This fantasy constitutes a 
spatially and temporally bounded image of the ideal future—an “actual” possible future, 
carved out as a discriminable (and thus usable) object, from the infinite domain of 
potential possible futures. I use this definite image to evaluate the events and processes 
that constitute the interpreted present, as it unfolds around me, as I walk toward the 
elevator (on my way to the cafeteria). I want to make reality match my fantasy—to 
subdue my motivation (to please the gods, so to speak). If the unexpected occurs—say, 
the elevator is not operating—the mismatch temporarily stops me. I replace my current 
plan with an alternative behavioral strategy, designed to obtain the same end. This means 
that I do not reconfigure the temporally and spatially bounded map that I am using to 
evaluate my circumstances—that I am using to regulate my emotions. All I have to do is 
change strategy’. 

I decide to take the stairs to the cafeteria. If the stairs are blocked by construction, I am 
in more serious trouble. My original fantasy—“go down to the cafeteria and eat”—was 
predicated on an implicit presumption: I can get downstairs. This presumption, which I 
wasn’t really even aware of (which might be regarded as axiomatic, for the purposes of 
the current operation), has been violated. The story “go downstairs to eat” retained its 
function only in an environment characterized by valid means of between-tloor 
transportation. The existence of these means constituted a given—I had used the elevator 




Maps of meaning 46 


or the stairs so often that their very presence took on the aspect of a justifiably ignored 
constant. Once I had mastered the stairs or the elevator—once I had learned their 
location, position and mechanisms—I could take them for granted and presume their 
irrelevance. Predictable phenomena (read “thoroughly explored, and therefore adapted 
to”) do not attract attention; they do not require “consciousness.” No new behavioral 
strategies or frameworks of reference must be generated, in their presence. 

Anyway: the elevators are broken; the stairs are blocked. The map I was using to 
evaluate my environment has been invalidated: my ends are no longer tenable. In 
consequence, necessarily, the means to those ends (my plans to go to the cafeteria) have 
been rendered utterly irrelevant. I no longer know what to do. This means, in a nontrivial 
sense, that I no longer know where I am. I presumed I was in a place I was familiar 
with—indeed, many familiar things (the fact of the floor, for example) have not changed. 
Nonetheless, something fundamental has been altered—and I don’t know how 
fundamental. I am now in a place I cannot easily leave. I am faced with a number of new 
problems, in addition to my unresolved hunger—at least in potential (Will I get home 
tonight? Do I have to get someone to “rescue” me? Who could rescue me? Who do I 
telephone to ask for help? What if there was a fire?). My old plan, my old “story” (“I am 
going downstairs to get something to eat”) has vanished, and I do not know how to 
evaluate my current circumstances. My emotions, previously constrained by the existence 
of a temporarily valid plan, re-emerge in a confused jumble. I am anxious (“what will I 
do? What if there was a fire?”), frustrated (“I’m certainly not going to get any more work 
done tonight, under these conditions!”) angry (“who could have been stupid enough to 
block all the exits?”), and curious (“just what the hell is going on around here, 
anyway?”). Something unknown has occurred and blown all my plans. An emissary of 
chaos, to speak metaphorically, has disrupted my emotional stability. Figure 7: 
Emergence of “Revolutionary Novelty” in the Course of Goal-Directed Behavior 
graphically presents this state of affairs. 

The plans we formulate are mechanisms designed to bring the envisioned perfect 
future into being. Once formulated, plans govern our behavior —until we make a mistake. 
A mistake, which is the appearance of a thing or situation not envisioned, provides 
evidence for the incomplete nature of our plans—indicates that those plans and the 
presumptions upon which they are erected are in error and must be updated (or, heaven 
forbid, abandoned). As long as everything is proceeding according to plan, we remain on 
familiar ground—but when we err, we enter unexplored territory’. 

What is known and what unknown is always relative because what is unexpected 
depends entirely upon what we expect (desire)—on what we had previously planned and 
presumed. The unexpected constantly occurs because it is impossible, in the absence of 
omniscience, to formulate an entirely accurate model of what actually is happening or of 
what should hap- 



Maps of Meaning 47 



Figure 7: Emergence of “Revolutionary Novelty” in 
the Course of Goal-Directed Behavior 

pen; it is impossible to determine what results ongoing behavior will finally produce. 
Errors in representation of the unbearable present and the ideal, desired future are 
inevitable, in consequence, as are errors in implementation and representation of the 
means by which the former can be transformed into the latter. The infinite human 
capacity for error means that encounter with the unknown is inevitable, in the course of 
human experience; means that the likelihood of such encounter is as certain, regardless of 
place and time of individual existence, as death and taxation. The (variable) existence of 
the unknown, paradoxically enough, can therefore be regarded as an environmental 
constant. Adaptation to the “existence” of this domain must occur, therefore, in every 
culture, and in every historical period—regardless of the particulars of any given social or 
biological circumstance. 

Deviations from desired outcome constitute (relatively) novel events, indicative of 
errors in presumption, either at the level of analysis of current state, process or ideal 
future. Such mismatches—unpredictable, nonredundant or novel occurrences—constantly 
comprise the most intrinsically meaningful, interesting elements of the human 
experiential field. This interest and meaning signifies the presence of new information 
and constitutes a prepotent stimulus for human (and animal) action. 84 It is where the 
unpredictable emerges that the possibility for all new and useful information exists. It is 
during the process of exploration of the unpredictable or unexpected that all knowledge 





Maps of meaning 48 


and wisdom is generated, all boundaries of adaptive competence extended, all foreign 
territory explored, mapped and mastered. The eternally extant domain of the unknown 
therefore constitutes the matrix from which all conditional knowledge emerges. 
Everything presently known to each, everything rendered predictable, was at one time 
unknown to all, and had to be rendered predictable—beneficial at best, irrelevant at 
worst—as a consequence of active exploration-driven adaptation. The matrix is of 
indeterminable breadth: despite our great storehouse of culture, despite the wisdom 
bequeathed to us by our ancestors, we are still fundamentally ignorant, and will remain 
so, no matter how much we learn. The domain of the unknown surrounds us like an ocean 
surrounds an island. We can increase the area of the island, but we never take away much 
from the sea. 


Exploration: Phenomenology and Neuropsychology 

The unfamiliar exists as an invariant feature of experience. We remain ignorant, and act 
while surrounded by uncertainty. Just as fundamentally, however, we always know 
something, no matter who we are, or when we live. We tend to view the “environment” 
as something objective, but one of its most basic features—familiarity, or lack thereof— 
is something virtually defined by the subjective. This environmental subjectivity is 
nontrivial, as well: mere “interpretation” of a phenomenon can determine whether we 
thrive or sicken, live or die. It appears, indeed, that the categorization or characterization 
of the environment as unknown/ known (nature/culture, foreign/familiar) might be 
regarded as more “fundamental” than any objective characterization—if we make the 
presumption that what we have adapted to is, by definition, reality. For it is the case that 
the human brain—and the brain of higher animals—has specialized for operation in the 
“domain of order” and the “domain of chaos.” And it is impossible to understand the fact 
of this specialization, unless those domains are regarded as more than mere metaphor. 

We normally use our conceptions of cognitive processes to illuminate the working of 
the brain (we use our models of thought to determine “what must be the case” 
physiologically). However, neuropsychological investigation has advanced to the point 
where the reverse procedure is equally useful. What is known about brain function can 
illuminate our conceptions of cognition (indeed, of “reality” itself) and can provide those 
conceptions with suitable “objective constraints.” Enlightenment thought strove to 
separate “reason” and “emotion”; empirical investigations into the structure and function 
of the brain—given great initial impetus by the consequences of that separation—have 
demonstrated instead that the two realms are mutually interdependent, and essentially 
integral. 90 We live in a universe characterized by the constant interplay of yang and yin, 
chaos and order: emotion provides us with an initial guide when we don’t know what we 
are doing, when reason alone will not suffice. 91

Figure 8: The Motor and Sensory Units of the Brain 

“Cognition,” by contrast, allows us to construct and maintain our ordered environments, 
and keep chaos—and affect—in check. 

The brain may be usefully regarded as composed of three primary units—motor, 
sensory and affective—or as constituting a matched pair of hemispheres, right and left. 
Each manner of conceptual subdivision has its theoretical advantages; furthermore, the 
two are not mutually exclusive. We will attend to the description of the units, portrayed 
schematically in Figure 8: The Motor and Sensory Units of the Brain, first. 

Most neocortical (and many subcortical) structures have attained their largest and most 
complex level of development in homo sapiens. This is true, in particular, of the motor 
unit, 92 which comprises the anterior or forward half of the comparatively newer neocortex 
(and which is composed of the motor, premotor and prefrontal lobes). This level of 
heightened development accounts in part for increased human intelligence, behavioral 
versatility and breadth of experience, both actual and potential, and underlies our capacity 
to formulate plans and intentions, organize them into programs of action and regulate 
their execution. 93 

The sensory unit, 94 which comprises the posterior half of the neocortex (and which is 
composed of the parietal, occipital and temporal lobes), is responsible for the 
construction of the separate worlds of our sensory systems (primarily sight, hearing and 
touch) and for their integration into the unified perceptual field that constitutes our 
conscious experience. 95 The sensory unit processes the information generated in the 






Maps of meaning 50 


course of the actions planned by the motor unit, and builds the world of the recognizable 
and familiar out of that information. 

The “limbic unit,” finally—phylogenetically ancient, tucked under the folds of the 
neocortex—compares 96 the nature of behavioral consequences, as they occur, with a 
dynamic model, extant in fantasy, of what was supposed to occur, what was desired to 
happen. It is therefore signaling of motivational significance, or affective importance, that 
constitutes what is perhaps the major responsibility of the limbic system—that, and the 
(integrally related) inculcation and renewal of memory (“integrally related,” as it is 
significant events that transform knowledge—that are stored in memory [more 
accurately, that alter memory]). This process of signaling necessarily involves 
comparison of the undesirable present, as currently understood, with the ideal future, as 
currently imagined. The capacity to generate such a contrast appears dependent upon 
operations undertaken deep within the comparatively ancient central portion of the brain, 
particularly in the tightly integrated structures known as the hippocampus 97 and 
amygdala. 98 The nature of this comparative process can perhaps best be understood, in 
introduction, through consideration of a phenomenon known as the event-related cortical 
potential. 

The brain constantly produces a shifting pattern of electrical activity in the course of 
its operations. The electroencephalogram (the EEG) provides a rough picture of that 
pattern. The individual undergoing EEG examination has electrodes placed in an array on 
his scalp. These electrodes allow the patterns of electrical activity, generated in the 
course of neurological activity, to be detected, monitored and, to some degree, localized. 
(The brain produces enough electrical activity to be detected through the skull and tissue 
surrounding it, although the interference produced by that surrounding tissue makes 
evaluation of the EEG difficult). The rather limited capacities of EEG technology have 
been greatly extended by the analytic capacities of the computer. The cortical event- 
related potential is a measure of brain activity derived by computer from EEG recordings 
averaged at different delays after the subject being evaluated has been presented with 
some sort of stimulus. The nature of this stimulus may vary. In the simplest case, it is 
merely something sensory, like a tone presented repeatedly through stereo headphones. In 
more complex cases the event-related potential is monitored following presentation of a 
stimulus with affective valence—which means following something that must be 
“discriminated, recognized, or otherwise evaluated.” 99 Perhaps the simplest way to 
produce an event of this sort is to randomly and rarely insert a tone that differs in 
frequency into a repetitious sequence of otherwise predictable tones (although the 
stimulus might just as easily be visual or tactile). These oddball events are characterized 
by (relative) novelty (novelty is always relative) and evoke a pattern of cortical electrical 
activity that differs from that produced by the predictable tones. Any event that has 
specific or known implications for alteration in ongoing behavior will also produce a 
potential like the oddball. 

The average cortical event-related potential produced by infrequent or otherwise 
meaningful events is a waveform with a characteristic time course and shape. Most 
attention has been paid to elements of this waveform that occur within the first half- 
second (500 milliseconds) after stimulus occurrence. As the first half-second passes, the 
polarity of the waveform shifts. Peaks and valleys occur at different, more or less 
standard times (and in essentially predictable “locations”) and have therefore been 



Maps of Meaning 51 


identified and named. Event-related potentials (ERPs) are negative (N) or positive (P) 
depending on polarity and are numbered according to their occurrence in time. The 
earliest aspects of the ERP (<200 msec) vary with change in the purely sensory quality of 
an event. The waveforms named N200 (negative 200 msec) and P300 (positive 300 
msec), by contrast, vary with the affective significance and magnitude of the stimulus, 
and can even be evoked by the absence of an event that was expected, but that did not 
appear. The psychophysiologist Eric Halgren states: 

One may summarize the cognitive conditions that evoke the N2/P3 as 
being the presentation of stimuli that are novel or that are signals for 
behavioral tasks, and thus need to be attended to, and processed. These 
evoking conditions and functional consequences are identical to those that 
have been found for the orienting reflex. 100 

Halgren considers the N2/P3 and the autonomic orienting reflex “different parts of an 
overall organismic reaction complex evoked by stimuli that merit further evaluation.” 101 
He terms this overall response pattern the orienting complex. A substantial body of 
evidence suggests that the amygdalic and hippocampal systems are critically involved in 
production of the N2/P3 waveforms, although other brain systems also participate. (It is 
also of great interest to note that an additional waveform, the N4, is produced when 
human experimental subjects are exposed to abstracted symbols with integral 
significance, such as written, spoken or signed words and faces, in a meaningfi.il 
context. 102 In such a context, the N4 occurs after the N2 but before the P3, and increases 
in magnitude as a function of the difficulty of integrating the word with the context in 
which it appears. The amygdala and hippocampus are also directly responsible for the 
production of this waveform—and, therefore, for contextual synthesis, which is a vital 
aspect of the derivation of meaning, which is significance for behavior, given the desire 
to attain a particular goal.) 

The processes that reveal themselves behaviorally in the orienting complex and 
electrophysiologically in the N2/N4/P3 waveform appear to play a central part in the 
manifold processes we experience (and understand) as consciousness. Another 
psychophysiologist, Arne Oh man. 10 ’ has posited that orienting initiates a sequence of 
“controlled processing,” which is difficult, slow, accompanied by awareness, sequential 
and generative (and which is referred to as exploratory> behavior in this document), 
contrasted with “automatic processing,” which is habitual, “unconscious” and immediate 
(and which occurs in “explored territory”). The orienting complex is apparently 
manifested only when a given experimental subject becomes aware of some relationship 
between sensory input and motor action. Likewise, the N2/P3 waveform appears only 
when the experimental stimulus utilized “has captured the subject’s attention and reached 
his or her awareness.” 104 Consciousness (affiliated tightly with orienting, for the purposes 
of the present argument) therefore appears as a phenomenon critically involved in and 
vital to the evaluation of novelty—appears vital to placement of the unpredictable into a 
defined and determinate context as a consequence of behavioral modification undertaken 
in the territory of the unknown. This means that consciousness plays a centrally important 
role in the generation of the predictable and comprehended world from the domain of the 
unexpected. Such response, placement and generation remains forever mediated by the

twin forces of hope/curiosity and anxiety—forces produced, noncoincidentally, by the 
same structures that govern “reflexive” orientation and exploratory motor output. 

The constant and universal presence of the incomprehensible in the world has elicited 
adaptive response from us and from all other creatures with highly developed nervous 
systems. We have evolved to operate successfully in a world eternally composed of the 
predictable, in paradoxical juxtaposition with the unpredictable. The combination of what 
we have explored and what we have still to evaluate actually comprises our environment, 
insofar as its nature can be broadly specified—and it is to that environment that our 
physiological structure has become matched. One set of the systems that comprise our 
brain and mind governs activity, when we are guided by our plans—when we are in the 
domain of the known. Another appears to operate when we face something unexpected— 
when we have entered the realm of the unknown} 05 

The “limbic unit” generates the orienting reflex, among its other tasks. It is the 
orienting reflex, which manifests itself in emotion, thought and behavior, that is at the 
core of the fundamental human response to the novel or unknown. This reflex takes a 
biologically determined course, ancient in nature, primordial as hunger or thirst, basic as 
sexuality, extant similarly in the animal kingdom, far down the chain of organic being. 
The orienting reflex is the general instinctual reaction to the category of all occurrences 
which have not yet been categorized—is response to the unexpected, novel or unknown 
per se, and not to any discriminated aspect of experience, any specifically definable 
situation or thing. The orienting reflex is at the core of the process that generates 
(conditional) knowledge of sensory phenomena and motivational relevance or valence. 
Such knowledge is most fundamentally how to behave, and what to expect as a 
consequence, in a particular situation, defined by culturally modified external 
environmental circumstance and equally modified internal motivational state. It is also 
information about what is, from the objective perspective—is the record of that sensory 
experience occurring in the course of ongoing behavior. 

The orienting reflex substitutes for particular learned responses when the 
incomprehensible suddenly makes its appearance. The occurrence of the unpredictable, 
the unknown, the source of fear and hope, creates a seizure of ongoing specifically goal- 
directed behavior. Emergence of the unexpected constitutes evidence for the incomplete 
nature of the story currently guiding such behavior; comprises evidence for error at the 
level of working description of current state, representation of desired future state or 
conception of the means to transform the former into the latter. Appearance of the 
unknown motivates curious, hopeful exploratory behavior, regulated by fear, as means to 
update the memory-predicated working model of reality (to update the known, so to 
speak, which is defined or familiar territory). The simultaneous production of two 
antithetical emotional states, such as hope and fear, means conflict, and the unexpected 
produces intrapsychic conflict like nothing else. The magnitude and potential intensity of 
this conflict cannot be appreciated under normal circumstances, because under normal 
circumstances—in defined territory—things are going according to plan. It is only when 
our goals have been destroyed that the true significance of the decontextualized object or 
experience is revealed—and such revelation makes itself known first in the form of 
fear. 106 We are protected from such conflict—from subjugation to instinctive terror—by 
the historical compilation of adaptive information generated in the course of previous 
novelty-driven exploration. We are protected from unpredictability by our culturally 



Maps of Meaning 53 


determined beliefs, by the stories we share. These stories tell us how to presume and how 
to act to maintain the determinate, shared and restricted values that compose our familiar 
worlds. 

The orienting reflex—the involuntary gravitation of attention to novelty—lays the 
groundwork for the emergence of (voluntarily controlled) exploratory behavior. 107 
Exploratory behavior allows for classification of the general and (a priori) motivationally 
significant unexpected into specified and determinate domains of motivational relevance. 
In the case of something with actual (post-investigation) significance, relevance means 
context-specific punishment or satisfaction, or their putatively “second-order” 
equivalents: threat or promise (as something threatening implies punishment, as 
something promising implies satisfaction). This is categorization, it should be noted, in 
accordance with implication for motor output, or behavior, rather than with regard to 
sensory (or, formalized, objective) property. 108 We have generally presumed that the 
purpose of exploration is production of a picture of the objective qualities of the territory 
explored. This is evidently—but only partially—true. However, the reasons we produce 
such pictures (are motivated to produce such pictures) are not usually given sufficient 
consideration. Every explorable subterritory, so to speak, has its sensory aspect, but it is 
the emotional or motivational relevance of the new domain that is truly important. We 
need to know only that something is hard and glowing red as a means of keeping track of 
the fact that it is hot, and therefore dangerous—that it is punishing, if contacted. We need 
to know the feel and look of objects so that we can keep track of what can be eaten and 
what might eat us. 

When we explore a new domain, we are mapping the motivational or affective 
significance of the things or situations that are characteristic of our goal-directed 
interactions within that domain, and we use the sensory information we encounter to 
identify what is important. It is the determination of specific meaning, or emotional 
significance, in previously unexplored territory—not identification of the objective 
features—that allows us to inhibit the novelty-induced terror and curiosity emergence of 
that territory otherwise automatically elicits. We feel comfortable somewhere new, once 
we have discovered that nothing exists there that will threaten or hurt us (more 
particularly, when we have adjusted our behavior and schemas of representation so that 
nothing there is likely to or able to threaten or hurt us). The consequence of exploration 
that allows for emotional regulation (that generates security, essentially) is not objective 
description, as the scientist might have it, but categorization of the implications of an 
unexpected occurrence for specification of means and ends. Such categorization is what 
an object “is,” from the perspective of archaic affect and subjective experience. The 
orienting reflex, and the exploratory behavior following its manifestation, also allows for 
the differentiation of the unknown into the familiar categories of objective reality. 
However, this ability is a late development, emerging only four hundred years ago, 109 and 
cannot be considered basic to “thinking.” Specification of the collectively apprehensible 
sensory qualities of something—generally considered, in the modern world, as the 
essential aspect of the description of reality—merely serves as an aid to the more 
fundamental process of evaluation, determining the precise nature of relevant or 
potentially relevant phenomena. 

When things are going according to plan—that is, when our actions fulfill our 
desires—we feel secure, even happy. When nothing is going wrong, the cortical systems 



Maps of meaning 54 


expressly responsible for the organization and implementation of goal-directed behavior 
remain firmly in control. When cortically generated plans and fantasies go up in smoke, 
however, this control vanishes. The comparatively ancient “limbic” hippocampal and 
amygdalic systems leap into action, modifying affect, interpretation and behavior. The 
hippocampus appears particularly specialized for comparing the (interpreted) reality of 
the present, as it manifests itself in the subjective sphere, with the fantasies of the ideal 
future constructed by the motor unit (acting in turn as the higher-order mediator—the 
king, so to speak—of all the specialized subsystems that compose the more fundamental 
or primary components of the brain). These desire-driven fantasies might be regarded as 
motivated hypotheses about the relative likelihood of events produced in the course of 
ongoing goal-directed activity. What you expect to happen—really, what you want to 
happen, at least in most situations—is a model you generate, using what you already 
know, in combination with what you are learning while you act. The hippocampal 
comparator 110 constantly and “unconsciously” checks what is “actually” happening 
against what is supposed to happen. This means that the comparator contrasts the 
“unbearable present,” insofar as it is comprehended (because it is a model, too), against 
the ideal future, as it is imagined; means that it compares the interpreted outcome of 
active behavior with an image of the intended consequences of that behavior. Past 
experience—skill and representation of the outcome of skill (or memory, as it is 
applied)—governs behavior, until error is committed. When something occurs that is not 
intended—when the actual outcome, as interpreted, does not match the desired outcome, 
as posited—the hippocampus shifts mode and prepares to update cortical memory 
storage. Behavioral control shifts from the cortex to the limbic system—apparently, to the 
amygdala, which governs the provisional determination of the affective significance of 
unpredictable events, and has powerful output to centers of motor control. 111 This shift of 
control allows the activation of structures governing orienting, heightened intensity of 
sensory processing and exploration. 

The “higher” cortex controls behavior until the unknown emerges—until it makes a 
mistake in judgment, until memory no longer serves—until the activity it governs 
produces a mismatch between what is desired and what actually occurs. When such a 
mismatch occurs, appropriate affect (fear and curiosity) emerges. But how can situation¬ 
relevant emotion attach itself to what has by definition not yet been encountered? 
Traditionally, significance is attached to previously irrelevant things or situations as a 
consequence of learning, which is to say that things mean nothing until their meaning is 
learned. No learning has taken place, however, in the face of the unknown—yet emotion 
reveals itself, in the presence of error. It appears, therefore, that the kind of emotion that 
the unpredictable arouses is not learned—which is to say that the novel or unexpected 
comes preloaded with affect. Things are not irrelevant, as a matter of course. They are 
rendered irrelevant, as a consequence of (successful) exploratory behavior. When they 
are first encountered, however, they are meaningful. It is the amygdala, at bottom, that 
appears responsible for the (disinhibited) generation of this a priori meaning—terror and 
curiosity. 

The amygdala appears to automatically respond to all things or situations, unless told 
not to. It is told not to—is functionally inhibited—when ongoing goal-directed behaviors 
produce the desired (intended) results. 112 When an error occurs, however—indicating that 
current memory-guided motivated plans and goals are insufficient—the amygdala is 



Maps of Meaning 55 


released from inhibition and labels the unpredictable occurrence with meaning. Anything 
unknown is dangerous and promising, simultaneously: evokes anxiety, curiosity, 
excitement and hope automatically and prior to what we would normally regard as 
exploration or as (more context-specific) classification. The operations of the amygdala 
are responsible for ensuring that the unknown is regarded with respect, as the default 
decision. The amygdala says, in effect, “if you don’t know what it signifies, you’d better 
pay attention to it.” Attention constitutes the initial stage of exploratory behavior, 
motivated by amygdalic operation—composed of the interplay between anxiety, 113 which 
impels caution in the face of novelty-threat, and hope, which compels approach to 
novelty-promise. 114 Caution-regulated approach allows for the update of memory in the 
form of skill and representation. Exploration-updated memory inhibits the production of 
a priori affect. On familiar ground—in explored territory—we feel no fear (and 
comparatively little curiosity). 

The desired output of behavior (what should be) is initially posited; if the current 
strategy fails, the approach and exploration system is activated, 115 although it remains 
under the governance of anxiety. The approach system (and its equivalent, in abstraction) 
generates (1) alternative sequences of behavior, whose goal is the production of a 
solution to the present dilemma; (2) alternative conceptualizations of the desired goal; or 
(3) re-evaluation of the motivational significance of the current state. This means (1) that 
a new strategy for attaining the desired goal might be invented, or (2) that a replacement 
goal, serving the same function, might be chosen; or (3) that the behavioral strategy 
might be abandoned, due to the cost of its implementation. In the latter case, the whole 
notion of what constitutes “reality,” at least with regard to the story or frame of reference 
currently in use, might have to be

reconstructed. This most troublesome state of affairs is schematically presented, in its 
successful form, in Figure 9: The Regeneration of Stability from the Domain of 
Chaos. 116 

Exploratory activity culminates normally in restriction, expansion, or transformation 
of the behavioral repertoire. In exceptional, non-normal circumstances—that is, when a 
major error has been committed—such activity culminates in revolution, in modification 
of the entire story guiding affective evaluation and behavioral programming. Such 
revolutionary modification means update of modeled reality, past, present and future, 
through incorporation of information generated during exploratory behavior. Successful 
exploration transforms the unknown into the expected, desired and predictable; 
establishes appropriate behavioral measures (and expectations of those measures) for next 
contact. Unsuccessful exploration, by contrast—avoidance or escape—leaves the novel 
object firmly entrenched in its initial, “natural,” anxiety-provoking category. This 
observation sets the stage for a fundamental realization: human beings do not learn to fear 
new objects or situations, or even really “learn” to fear something that previously 
appeared safe, when it manifests a dangerous property. Fear is the a priori position, the 
natural response to everything for which no structure of behavioral adaptation has been 
designed and inculcated. Fear is the innate reaction to everything that has not been 
rendered predictable, as a consequence of successful, creative exploratory behavior 
undertaken in its presence, at some time in the past. FeDoux states: 




Maps of Meaning 57 


It is well established that emotionally neutral stimuli can acquire the 
capacity to evoke striking emotional reaction following temporal pairing 
with an aversive event. Conditioning does not create new emotional 
responses but instead simply allows new stimuli to serve as triggers 
capable of activating existing, often hard-wired, species-specific 
emotional reactions. In the rat, for example, a pure tone previously paired 
with footshock evokes a conditioned fear reaction consisting of freezing 
behavior accompanied by a host of autonomic adjustments, including 
increases in arterial pressure and heart rate. 117 Similar responses are 
expressed when laboratory rats are exposed to a cat for the first time, but 
following amygdala lesions such responses are no longer present, 118 
suggesting that the responses are genetically specified (since they appear 
when the rat sees a cat, a natural predator, for the first time) and involve 
the amygdala. The fact that electrical stimulation of the amygdala is 
capable of eliciting the similar response patterns 119 further supports the 
notion that the responses are hard-wired. 120 

Fear is not conditioned; security is unlearned, in the presence of particular things or 
contexts, as a consequence of violation of explicit or implicit presupposition. Classical 
behavioral psychology is wrong in the same manner our folk presumptions are wrong: 
fear is not secondary, not learned; security is secondary, learned. Everything not explored 
is tainted, a priori, with apprehension. Any thing or situation that undermines the 
foundations of the familiar and secure is therefore to be feared. 1 ’ 1 

It is difficult for us to formulate a clear picture of the subjective effects of the systems 
that dominate our initial response to the truly unpredictable, because we strive with all 
our might to ensure that everything around us remains normal. Under “normal” 
conditions, therefore, these primordial systems never operate with their frill force. It 
might be said, with a certain amount of justification, that we devote our entire lives to 
making sure that we never have to face anything unknown, in the revolutionary sense —at 
least not accidentally. Our success in doing so deludes us about the true nature, power 
and intensity of our potential emotional responses. As civilized people, we are secure. We 
can predict the behaviors of others (that is, if they share our stories); furthermore, we can 
control our environments well enough to ensure that our subjection to threat and 
punishment remains at a minimum. It is the cumulative consequences of our adaptive 
struggle—our cultures—which enable this prediction and control. The existence of our 
cultures, however, blinds us to the nature of our true (emotional) natures—at least to the 
range of that nature, and to the consequences of its emergence. 

Experimental examinations of the orienting reflex have not shed much light on our 
true potential for emotional response, in the past, because they generally took place under 
exceptionally controlled circumstances. Subjects evaluated for their responses to 
“novelty” are generally presented with stimuli that are novel only in the most “normal” of 
manners. A tone, for example, which differs unpredictably from another tone (or which 
appears at a relatively unpredictable time) is still a tone, something experienced a 
thousand times before and something experienced in a lab, in a hospital or university, 
under the jurisdiction of trustworthy personnel devoted to minimizing the anxiety- 
provoking nature of the experimental procedure. The controlled circumstances of the 



Maps of meaning 


58 


experiment (which are, in fact, the implicit and therefore invisible theoretical 
presumptions of the experiment) have led us to minimize the importance of the orienting 
reflex, and to misunderstand the nature of its disappearance. 

Orienting signifies “attention,” not terror, in the standard lab situation, and its gradual 
elimination with repeated stimulus presentation is regarded as “habituation”—as 
something boring, akin to automatic acclimation, adjustment or desensitization. 
Habituation is not a passive process, however, at least at higher cortical levels of 
processing. It just looks passive when observed under relatively trivial circumstances. It 
is in reality always the consequence of active exploration and subsequent modification of 
behavior, or interpretive schema. The (relatively) novel target laboratory tone, for 
example, is investigated for its underlying structure by the cortical systems involved in 
audition. These systems actively analyze the component elements of every sound. 1 ’" The 
subject is led to “expect” or predict one sort of sound and gets another. The unexpected 
other has indeterminate significance, in that particular context, and is therefore regarded 
as (comparatively) meaningful—threatening and promising. The unexpected tone is 
presented repeatedly. The exploratory subject notes that the repetitions signify nothing, in 
the context that defines the experimental situation (nothing punishing, satisfying, 
threatening or promising), and ceases to react. He has not merely “habituated” to the 
stimuli. He has mapped its context-dependent significance, which is zero. This process 
appears trivial because the experimental situation makes it so. In real life, it is anything 
but boring. 

Classical work conducted on animal “emotion” and motivation has taken place under 
circumstances reminiscent of the artificially constrained situations that define most work 
on human orienting. Animals, usually rats, are trained to be afraid—or to inhibit their 
behavior—in the presence of a neutral stimulus paired repeatedly with an 
“unconditioned” punishment [a stimulus whose motivational valence is negative, in the 
supposed absence of learning (or, at least, in the absence of interpretation)]. The rat is 
placed in the experimental environment and is allowed to familiarize himself with his 
surroundings. The neutral stimulus might be a light; the unconditioned stimulus, an 
electric shock. The light goes on; the floor of the rat’s cage is briefly electrified. This 
sequence occurs repeatedly. Soon the rat “freezes” as soon as the light appears. He has 
developed a “conditioned response,” manifesting behavioral inhibition (and fear, 
theoretically) to something that was previously neutral. Procedures of this sort effectively 
produce fear. The implicit contextual constraints or axioms of these procedures, however, 
lead researchers to draw odd conclusions about the nature of the “acquisition” of fear. 

Such experiments first imply that fear in a given situation is necessarily something 
learned. Second, they imply that fear exists as a consequence of exposure to punishment, 
and only because of that exposure. The problem with this interpretation is that the rat was 
inevitably afraid as soon as he was placed in the new experimental environment, even 
though nothing terrible had yet happened there. After he is allowed to explore, he calms 
down. It is only then that he is regarded as normal. The experimenter then jars the rat out 
of his acquired normalcy by presenting him with something unexpected and painful—the 
unconditioned stimulus, in conjunction with the neutral stimulus. He then “learns” to be 
afraid. Really what has happened is that the unexpected occurrence forces the rat to 
reattain the state he was in (or that same state, in an exaggerated manner) when he first 
entered the cage. The fact of the electric shock, in conjunction with the light, indicates to 



Maps of Meaning 59 


the rat (reminds the rat) that he is, once again, in unexplored territory. His fear, in 
unexplored territory, is just as normal as his complacency in environments that he has 
mapped and that hold no danger. We regard the calm rat as the real rat because we project 
our misinterpretations of our own habitual nature onto our experimental animals. It is as 
D.O.Hebb states: 

[The urbanity characterizing ourselves,]...the civilized, amiable, and 
admirable part of mankind, well brought up and not constantly in a state 
of fear...depends as much on our successfully avoiding disturbing 
stimulation as on a lowered sensitivity [to fear-producing stimuli].... 

[T]he capacity for emotional breakdown may [well] be self-concealing, 
leading [animals and human beings] to find or create an environment in 
which the stimuli to excessive emotional response are at a minimum. So 
effective is our society in this regard that its members—especially the 
well-to-do and educated ones—may not even guess at some of their own 
potentialities. One usually thinks of education, in the broad sense, as 
producing a resourceful, emotionally stable adult, without respect to the 
environment in which these traits are to appear. To some extent this may 
be true. But education can be seen as being also the means of establishing 
a protective social environment in which emotional stability is possible. 

Perhaps it strengthens the individual against unreasonable fears and rages, 
but it certainly produces a uniformity of appearance and behavior which 
reduces the frequency with which the individual member of the society 
encounters the causes of such emotion. On this view, the susceptibility to 
emotional disturbance may not be decreased. It may in fact be increased. 

The protective cocoon of uniformity, in personal appearance, manners, 
and social activity generally, will make small deviations from custom 
appear increasingly strange and thus (if the general thesis is sound) 
increasingly intolerable. The inevitable small deviations from custom will 
bulk increasingly large, and the members of the society, finding 
themselves tolerating trivial deviations well, will continue to think of 
themselves as socially adaptable. 123 

Our emotional regulation depends as much (or more) on the stability and predictability of 
the social environment (on the maintenance of our cultures) as on “interior” processes, 
classically related to the strength of the ego or the personality. Social order is a necessary 
precondition for psychological stability: it is primarily our companions and their actions 
(or inactions) that stabilize or destabilize our emotions. 

A rat (a person) is a complacent creature in explored territory. When in unexplored 
territory, however, it is anything but calm. A rat moved from its home cage to a new and 
unknown environment—a new cage, for example—will first freeze (even though it has 
never been punished, in the new situation). If nothing terrible happens to it (nothing 
punishing, threatening or additionally unpredictable) it will begin to sniff, to look around, 
to move its head, to gather new information about the intrinsically frightening place it 
now inhabits. Gradually, it starts to move about. It will explore the whole cage with 
increasing confidence. It is mapping the new environment for affective valence. It wants 



Maps of meaning 60 


to find out: is there anything here that will kill me? Anything here I can eat? Anyone else 
here—someone hostile or friendly? A potential mate? The rat is interested in determining 
whether the new place contains anything of determinate interest to a rat, and it explores, 
to the best of its capacity, to make that judgment. It is not primarily interested in the 
“objective” nature of the new circumstances—a rat cannot actually determine what is 
objective and what is merely “personal opinion.” Nor does it care. It just wants to know 
what it should do. 

What happens if an animal encounters something truly unexpected—something that 
should just not be, according to its current frame of reference or system of belief? The 
answer to this question sheds substantial light on the nature of the orienting reflex, in its 
lull manifestation. Modern experimental psychologists have begun to examine the 
response of animals to natural sources of mystery and threat. They allow the animals to 
set up their own environments, realistic environments, and then expose them to the kinds 
of surprising circumstances they might encounter in real life. The appearance of a 
predator in previously safe space (space previously explored, that is, and mapped as 
useful or irrelevant) constitutes one type of realistic surprise. Blanchard and colleagues 
describe the naturalistic behavior of rats, under such conditions: 

When a cat is presented to established mixed-sex groups of laboratory rats 
living in a visible burrow system, the behaviors of the subjects change 
dramatically, in many cases for 24 hours or more. 124 The initial active 
defensive behavior, flight to the tunnel/chamber system, is followed by a 
period of immobility during which the rats make 22 kHz ultrasonic 
vocalizations, which apparently serve as alarm cries, at a high rate. 123 As 
freezing breaks up, proxemic avoidance of the open area gradually gives 
way to a pattern of “risk assessment” of the area where the cat was 
encountered. Subjects poke their heads out of the tunnel openings to scan 
the open area where the cat was presented, for minutes or hours before 
emerging, and when they do emerge, their locomotory patterns are 
characterized by [behaviors that theoretically reduce their visibility and 
vulnerability to predators and by] very short “corner runs” into and out of 
the open area. These risk assessment activities appear to involve active 
gathering of information about the possible danger source, 126 providing a 
basis for a gradual return to nondefensive behaviors. 127 Active risk 
assessment is not seen during early post-cat exposure, when freezing and 
avoidance of the open area are the dominant behaviors, but rises to a peak 
about 7-10 hours later, and then gradually declines. Nondefensive 
behaviors 128 such as eating, drinking and sexual and aggressive activity 
tend to be reduced over the same period. 129 

The unexpected appearance of a predator where nothing but defined territory previously 
existed terrifies the rats—badly enough that they “scream” about it, persistently, for a 
long period of time. Once this initial terror abates—which occurs only if nothing else 
horrible or punishing happens—curiosity is disinhibited, and the rats return to the scene 
of the crime. The space “renovelized” by the fact of the cat has to be transformed once 
again into explored territory as a consequence of active modification of behavior (and 



Maps of Meaning 61 


representational schema), not by passive desensitization to the unexpected. The rats run 
across the territory “contaminated” by the presence of the cat, to find out if anything 
dangerous (to running rats) still lurks there. If the answer is “no,” then the space is 
defined, once again, as home territory (which is that place where commonplace behaviors 
produce desired ends). The rats transform the dangerous unknown into familiar territory 
as a consequence of voluntary exploration. In the absence of such exploration, terror 
reigns unchecked. 

It is just as illuminating to consider the responses of rats to their kin, who constitute 
“explored territory,” in contrast to their attitude toward “strangers,” whose behavior is not 
predictable. Rats are highly social animals, perfectly capable of living with their familiar 
compatriots in peace. They do not like members of other kin groups, however; they will 
hunt them down and kill them. Accidental or purposeful intruders are dealt with in the 
same manner. Rats identify one another by smell. If an experimenter removes a well¬ 
loved rat from its familial surroundings, scrubs it down, provides it with a new odor, and 
returns it to its peers, it will be promptly dispatched by those who once loved it. The 
“new” rat constitutes “unexplored territory”; his presence is regarded as a threat (not 
unreasonably) to everything currently secure. 130 Chimpanzees, perfectly capable of 
killing “foreign devils” (even those who were once familiar), act in much the same 
manner. 1 ' 1 


Explored Territory: Phenomenology and Neuropsychology 

When we explore, we transform the indeterminate status and meaning of the unknown 
thing that we are exploring into something determinate—in the worst case, rendering it 
nonthreatening, nonpunishing; in the best, manipulating and/or categorizing it so that it is 
useful. Animals perform this transformation in the course of actual action, which is to say 
that they construct their worlds by shifting their positions and changing their actions in 
the face of the unknown, and by mapping the consequences of those shifts and changes in 
terms of their affective or motivational valence. When an animal encounters an 
unexpected situation, such as a new object placed in its cage, it first freezes, watching the 
object. If nothing terrible happens while it is immobile, it moves, slowly and at a 
distance, monitoring the thing for its reactions to these cautious exploratory activities. 
Perhaps the animal sniffs at the thing, or scratches at it—trying to determine what it 
might be good (or bad) for. It maps the utility and valence of the object, conceived in 
relationship to its ongoing activity (and, perhaps, to possible patterns of activity in the 
future). The animal builds its world of significances from the information generated in 
the course of-—as a consequence of-—ongoing exploratory behavior. The application of 
experimental search programs, drawn primarily from the reservoir of learned (imitated) 
and instinctual behavior, or manifested as trial and error, involves behavioral alteration 
(exploration, play) and subsequent transformation of sensory and affective input. When 
an animal actively explores something new, it changes the sensory quality and 
motivational significance of that aspect of its experience as a consequence of its 
exploratory strategy. This means that the animal exhibits a variety of behaviors in a given 
mysterious situation and monitors the results. It is the organized interpretation of these 
results and the behaviors that produce them that constitute the world, past, present and 



Maps of meaning 62 


future, of the animal (in conjunction with the unknown, of course—which constantly 
supersedes the capacity for representation). 

It is not too much to say that the animal elicits the properties of the object, sensory and 
affective, (or even brings them into being) through its capacity for creative 
investigation. 1 ' 2 Animals that are relatively simple—compared, say, to higher-order 
primates, including man—are limited in the behaviors they manifest by the structure of 
their physiology. A rat cannot pick anything up, for example, to examine it in detail—and 
does not in addition have the visual capacity to focus intensely on the kinds of tiny 
features we can perceive. Higher-order nonhuman primates have a more developed grip, 
however, which enables more detailed exploration, and, in addition, have a relatively 
sophisticated prefrontal cortex. This means that such primates can evoke more features 
from the world, directly, and that they are increasingly capable of modeling and acting. 
The prefrontal cortex is the newest part of the motor unit, and “grew” out of the direct 
motor control centers, in the course of cortical evolution. 1 ' 3 More sophistication in 
development of the prefrontal centers means, in part, heightened capability for abstract 
exploration, which means investigation in the absence of actual movement, which means 
the capacity to learn from the observation of others and through consideration of potential 
actions before they emerge in behavior. This means increasing capability for thought, 
considered as abstracted action and representation. 134 Action and thought produce 
phenomena. Novel acts and thoughts necessarily produce new phenomena. Creative 
exploration, concrete and abstract, is therefore linked in a direct sense to being. Increased 
capacity for exploration means existence in a qualitatively different—even new—world. 
This entire argument implies, of course, that more complex and behaviorally flexible 
animals inhabit (“construct,” if you will 135 ) a more complex universe. 

Humans possess cortical development—prefrontal and otherwise—that is unique in its 
great mass and, more importantly, in its structure. Various indices of development have 
been used to signify the nature of the relationship between the brain and intelligence. 
Sheer mass is one measure, degree of surface convolution another. The former measure is 
contaminated by size of animal. Larger animals tend to have more absolutely massive 
brains. This does not necessarily make them smarter. Brain mass corrected for body size 
constitutes the encephalization quotient, a common rough measure of animal 
intelligence. 1 ' 6 Degree of surface convolution constitutes an additionally useful measure. 
The gray matter of the brain, which theoretically does much of the work associated with 
intelligence, occupies the brain’s surface, which has been dramatically increased in area 
by folding. Some representatives of the cetacean family (dolphins and whales) have 
encephalization quotients similar to and brain surfaces more convoluted than man’s, 137 
although the thickness of the cetacean neocortex is about half that of the human. 138 
Consideration of this high level of nervous development has led to speculation about the 
potential superhuman range of cetacean ability. 1 ’ 9 However, it is structure and 
organization of cortex, not simply mass, or even relative mass or surface area, that most 
clearly defines the nature and reach of a species’ experience and competence. More 
particularly, it is embodiment of the brain that matters. Brain structure necessarily reflects

embodiment, despite the archaic presumption of the independence of spirit and matter (or 
soul and body, or mind and body), because the body is, in a primary sense, the 
environment to which the brain has adapted. 

The body is specifically represented in the neocortex. This representation is often 
given schematic form as the homunculus, or “little man.” The homunculus was 
“discovered” by Wilder Penfield, 140 who mapped the surface of the cortices of his 
neurosurgical patients by stimulating them electrically, painstakingly, point after point. 
He did this to find out what different sections of the brain were doing, so that he could do 
the least damage possible when attempting to surgically treat epilepsy or cancer or other 
forms of brain abnormality. He would probe the surface of the brain of one of his (awake) 
patients with an electrode (patients undergoing neurosurgery are frequently awake, as the 
brain feels no pain) and monitor the results, either directly or by asking the patient what 
he or she experienced. Sometimes such stimulation would produce visions, sometimes 
elicit memories; other times, it produced movements or sensations. Penfield determined, 
in this manner, how the body was mapped onto the central nervous system—how it was 
incarnated, so to speak, in intrapsychic representation. He established, for example, that 
homunculi come in two forms, motor and sensory—the former associated with the 
primary zone of the motor unit, the latter associated with the primary zone of the sensory 
area of the sensory unit. The motor form—represented schematically in Figure 10: The 
Motor Homunculus —is of most interest to us, because our discussion centers on motor

output. The motor homunculus is a very odd little “creature.” Its face (particularly mouth 
and tongue) and hands (particularly thumbs) are grossly disproportionate to the rest of its 
“body.” This is because comparatively large areas of the motor cortex are given over to 
control of the face and hands, which are capable of an immense number of complex and 
sophisticated operations. The motor homunculus is an interesting figure. It might be 
regarded as the body, insofar as the body has anything to do with the brain. It is useful to 
consider the structure of the homunculus, because it is in some profound way 
representative of our essential nature, as it finds expression in emotion and behavior. 

The most outstanding characteristic of the motor homunculus, for example—the hand, 
with its opposable thumb—is the defining feature of the human being. The ability to 
manipulate and explore characteristics of objects large and small—restricted as a general 
capacity to the highest primates—sets the stage for elicitation of an increased range of 
their properties, for their utilization as tools (for more comprehensive transformation of 
their infinite potential into definable actuality). The hand, used additionally to duplicate 
the action and function of objects, also allows first for imitation (and pointing), and then 
for full-blown linguistic representation. 141 Used for written language, the hand 
additionally enables long-distance (temporal and spatial) transfer of its ability to another 
(and for the elaboration and extension of exploration, during the process of writing, 
which is hand-mediated thinking). Even development of spoken language, the ultimate 
analytic motor skill, might reasonably be considered an abstract extension of the human 
ability to take things apart and reassemble them, in an original manner. Interplay between 
hand and brain has literally enabled the individual to change the structure of the world. 
Consideration of the structure and function of the brain must take this primary fact into 
account. A dolphin or whale has a large, complex brain—a highly developed nervous 
system—but it cannot shape its world. It is trapped, so to speak, in its streamlined test- 
tube-like form, specialized for oceanic life. It cannot directly alter the shape of its 
material environment in any complex manner. Its brain, therefore, is not likely prepared 
to perform any traditionally “creative” function (indeed, as one would suspect, lacks the 
sophisticated structuring characteristic of primate brains 14 ^). 

It is not just the hand, however, that makes the crucial human difference, although it is 
the most obvious, and perhaps the most important, single factor. It is more a style or 
melody of adaptation that characterizes the individual human being. This style is 
adaptation for exploration of the unknown, within a social context. This adaptation is 
capacity for (speech-mediated) creation, elaboration, remembrance, description and 
subsequent communication of new behavior patterns, and for representation of the 
(frequently novel) consequences of those patterns. The hand itself was rendered more 
useful by the development of vertical stance, which extended visual range and freed the 
upper body from the demands of locomo-tion. The fine musculature of the face, lips and 
tongue—over-represented, once again, in the motor homunculus—helped render subtle 
communication possible. Development of explicit language extended the power of such 
communication immensely. Increasingly detailed exchange of information enabled the 
resources of all to become the resources of each, and vice versa. That process of feedback 
greatly extended the reach and utility of the hand, providing every hand with the ability, 
at least in potential, of every other hand, extant currently or previously. Evolution of the 
restricted central field of the eye, which has input expanded 10,000 times in the primary 
visual area, and is additionally represented, interhemispherically, at several higher-order

cortical sites, 143 was of vital importance to development of visual language and enabled 
close observation, which made gathering of detailed information simpler. Combination of 
hand and eye enabled Homo sapiens to manipulate things in ways qualitatively different 
from those of any other animal. The individual can discover what things are like under 
various, voluntarily produced or accidentally encountered (yet considered) conditions— 
upside down, flying through the air, hit against other things, broken into pieces, heated in 
fire, and so on. The combination of hand and eye allowed human beings to experience 
and analyze the (emergent) nature of things. This ability, revolutionary as it was, was 
dramatically extended by application of hand-mediated, spoken (and written) language. 

The human style of adaptation extends from the evidently physical to the more subtly 
psychological, as well. The phenomenon of consciousness, for example—arguably the 
defining feature of man—appears related in some unknown fashion to breadth of cellular 
activation in the neocortex. Bodily features with large areas of cortical representation are 
also therefore more thoroughly represented in consciousness (at least in potential). This 
can be made immediately evident to subjective awareness merely by contrasting the 
capacity for control and monitoring of the hand, for example, with the much less 
represented expanse of the back. Consciousness also evidently expands or sharpens 
during the course of activities designed to enhance or increase adaptive competence— 
during the course of creative exploration. Processing of novel or otherwise interesting 
sensory information, associated with the orienting complex, heightened awareness and 
focused concentration, activates large areas of neocortex. Similarly, increased cortical 
mobilization takes place during the practice phase of skill acquisition, when awareness 
appears required for development of control. The area of such engagement or 
mobilization shrinks in size as movement becomes habitual and unconscious, or when 
sensory information loses interest or novelty. 144 Finally, as we have noted before, 
intrinsic pleasure of an intense nature appears to accompany activation of the cortical 
systems activated during psychomotor exploratory activity, undertaken in the face of the 
unknown. The operation of these systems appears mediated in part by the 
neurotransmitter dopamine 145 —involved in producing subjective and behavioral response 
to cues of reward, in the form of hope, curiosity and active approach. 

Human beings enjoy capacity for investigation, classification and consequent 
communication, which is qualitatively different from that characterizing any other 
animal. The material structure of Homo sapiens is ideal for exploration, and for the 
dissemination of the results thereof; spiritually—psychologically—man is characterized 
by the innate capacity to take true pleasure in such activity. Our physical attributes (the 
abilities of the hand, in combination with the other physiological specializations of man) 
define who we are and enable us to endlessly elicit new properties from previously stable 
and predictable elements of experience. The object—any object—serves us as a source of 
limitless possibility (or, at least, possibility limited only by the capacity for exploratory 
genius exhibited at any particular moment). Simple animals perform simple operations 
and inhabit a world whose properties are equally constrained (a world where most 
“information” remains “latent”). Human beings can manipulate—take apart and put 
together—with far more facility than any other creature. Furthermore, our capacity for 
communication, both verbal and nonverbal, has meant almost unbelievable facilitation of 
exploration, and subsequent diversity of adaptation. 



Maps of meaning 66 


Thinking might in many cases be regarded as the abstracted form of exploration—as 
the capacity to investigate, without the necessity of direct motoric action. Abstract 
analysis (verbal and nonverbal) of the unexpected or novel plays a much greater role for 
humans than for animals 146 —a role that generally takes primacy over action. It is only 
when this capacity fails partially or completely in humans—or when it plays a 
paradoxical role (amplifying the significance or potential danger of the unknown through 
definitive but “false” negative labeling)—that active exploration (or active avoidance), 
with its limitations and dangers, becomes necessary. Replacement of potentially 
dangerous exploratory action with increasingly flexible and abstracted thought means the 
possibility for growth of knowledge without direct exposure to danger, and constitutes 
one major advantage of the development of intelligence. The abstract intelligence 
characteristic of the human being developed in parallel with rapid evolution of the brain. 
We can communicate the results and interpretations of our manipulations (and the nature 
of the procedures that constitute that manipulation) to each other, across immense spatial 
and temporal barriers. This capacity for exploration, verbal elaboration and 
communication of such in turn dramatically heightens our capacity for exploration (as we 
have access to all communicated strategies and interpretive schemas, accumulated over 
time, generated in the course of the creative activity of others). In normal parlance, this 
would mean merely that we have been able to “discover” more aspects of the world. It 
seems to me more accurate, however, to recognize the limitations of this perspective, and 
to make room for the realization that new procedures and modes of interpretation literally 
produce new phenomena. The word enables differentiated thought and dramatically 
heightens the capacity for exploratory maneuvering. The world of human experience is 
constantly transformed and renewed as a consequence of such exploration. In this 
manner, the word constantly engenders new creation. 

The capacity to create novel behaviors and categories of interpretation in response to 
the emergence of the unknown might be regarded as the primary hallmark of human 
consciousness—indeed, of human being. Our engagement in this process literally allows 
us to carve the world out of the undifferentiated mass of unobserved and unencountered 
“existence” (a form of existence that exists only hypothetically, as a necessary fiction; a 
form about which nothing can be experienced, and less accurately stated). We carve out 
the world as a consequence of our direct interactions with the unknown—most notably, 
with our hands, which enable us to manipulate things, to change their sensory aspects 
and, most importantly, to change their importance to us, to give them new, more desirable 
value. The capacity for dextrous manipulation is particularly human, and has enabled us 
to radically alter the nature of our experience. Equally particular, however, is our capacity 
for abstract exploration, which is thought about action (and its consequences), in the 
absence of action (and its consequences). The manner in which we conduct our abstracted 
exploration appears as tightly linked to the physiological structures of our brains as the 
manner in which we move, while exploring. In novel circumstances, our behavioral 
output is mediated by the systems that govern fear, and appropriate inhibition, and hope, 
and appropriate activation. The same things happen when we think abstractly—even 
when we think about how others think. 147 

Animal exploration is primarily motor in nature. An animal must move around an 
unfamiliar thing or situation to determine its affective relevance and sensory nature. This 
process of moving around experimentally appears as a consequence of the interaction

between the mutually regulatory or inhibitory evaluative systems whose responsibilities 
are identification of potential danger or threat and potential satisfaction or promise. In the 
human case, each of these systems apparently comes, in the course of normal 
development, to dominate one of our twinned cortical hemispheres: the right governs 
response to threat (and to punishment), while the left controls response to promise and, 
perhaps (although much less clearly), to satisfaction. 148 This basically means that the 
right hemisphere governs our initial responses to the unknown, while the left is more 
suited for actions undertaken while we know what we are doing. This is in part because 
everything thoroughly explored has in fact been rendered either promising or satisfying 
(or, at least, irrelevant). If threat or punishment still lurks somewhere—that is, 
somewhere we must be—our behavioral adaptation is, by definition, insufficient (and the 
unexpected has not been vanquished). We have been unable to modify our actions to 
elicit from the environment—really, from the “unknown”—those consequences we wish 
to produce. 

Richard Davidson and his colleagues have been investigating the relationship between 
different patterns of cortical electrical activity and mood states in adults and children. 
Davidson et al. have concluded that the twin hemispheres of the human brain are 
differentially specialized for affect, at least with regard to their frontal regions. Signs of 
positive affect (like genuine smiling in infants) are accompanied by heightened 
comparative activation of the left frontal cortex. Negative states of affect (like those 
occuring in chronic depression), by contrast, are accompanied by heightened activation of 
the right frontal hemisphere. 149 Substantial additional evidence exists to support this 
general claim. To put it most fundamentally: it appears that the twin hemispheres of the 
brain are differentially specialized (1) for operation in unexplored territory, where the 
nature and valence of things remains indeterminate, and (2) for operation in explored 
territory, where things have been rendered either irrelevant or positive, as a consequence 
of previous exploration. Our brains contain two emotional systems, so to speak. One 
functions when we do not know what to do, and initiates the (exploratory) process that 
creates secure territory. The other functions when we are in fact secure. The fact of the 
presence of these two subsystems, but not their “locale,” has been

known for a good while; Maier and Schnierla 150 and Schnierla 151 hypothesized many 
decades ago that mechanisms of “withdrawal” and “approach” (characteristic of animals 
at virtually all levels of the evolutionary scale) provided the foundation for motivation as 
such. The nature of these two systems can best be understood by relating emotional state 
to motor activity, as we have done previously. 

Each hemisphere, right and left, appears to have what might be described as a family 
of related functions, portrayed in Figure 11: The Twin Cerebral Hemispheres and Their 
Functions. The right hemisphere, less language-fluent than its generally more dominant 
twin, appears specialized for the inhibition and extinction of behavior (and, therefore, for 
the production of negative emotion), for generation and manipulation of complex visual 
(and auditory) images, for coordination of gross motor actions, and for rapid and global 
recognition of patterns. 152 The right hemisphere appears to come “on-line” when a 
particular situation is rife with imcertainty—appears particularly good at governing 
behavior when what is and what to do have not yet been clearly specified. 15 ' It might be 
posited, in consequence, that this hemisphere is still under limbic control, since the 
limbic system is responsible for detecting novelty and initiating exploratory behavior. 
This archaic control mechanism would then “drive” the processes of imagistic 
“hypothesis” generation that constitute the processes of abstract exploration—fantasy— 
we use to give determinate (and oft-bizarre) form to the unknown. 

The left hemisphere, by contrast, appears particularly skilled at linguistic processing 
and communication, at detailed, linear thinking, at fine motor skill, and at the 
comprehension of wholes in terms of their constituent elements. 154 The left hemisphere— 
particularly its frontal or motor (sub)unit—also governs approach behavior 155 in the 
presence of cues of sat-isfaction, is integrally involved in the production of positive 
affect, and appears particularly good at carrying out practiced activities, applying familiar 
modes of apprehension. The left seems at its best when what is and what should be done

are no longer questions; when tradition governs behavior, and the nature and meaning of 
things has been relatively fixed. The dual specialization of the left—for what has been 
practiced, and for what is positive—can be understood, in part, in the following manner: 
positive affect rules in known territory, by definition. A thing or situation has been 
explored most optimally (and is therefore most well known) if it has been transformed by 
behavioral adaptations manifested in its presence into something of determinate use (or 
satisfaction) or into potential for such (into promise). 

The right hemisphere, in contrast to the left, appears to have remained in direct contact 
with, and to be specialized for encounter with, the unknown and its terrors, which are 
apperceived in the domain of instinct, motivation and affect, long before they can be 
classified or comprehended intellectually. The right hemisphere’s capacity for inhibition 
and extinction of behavior (for inducing caution during exploration, for governing flight, 
for producing negative affect) ensures that due respect is granted the inexplicable (and 
therefore dangerous) when it makes its appearance. The right’s aptitude for global pattern 
recognition (which appears as a consequence of its basic neurophysiological structure 156 ) 
helps ensure that a provisional notion (a fantastic representation) of the unknown event 
(what it is like, how action should be conducted in its presence, what other things or 
situations it brings to mind) might be rapidly formulated. The right hemisphere appears 
integrally involved in the initial stages of analysis of the unexpected or novel—and its a 
priori hypothesis is always this: this (unknown) place, this unfamiliar space, this 
unexplored territory is dangerous, and therefore partakes in the properties of all other 
known dangerous places and territories, and all those that remain unknown, as well. This 
form of information processing—“a” is “b”—is metaphor; generation of metaphor (key 
to the construction of narratives—dreams, dramas, stories and myth) might well be 
regarded as the first stage of hypothesis construction. As situation-specific adaptive 
behaviors are generated as a consequence of exploration, this provisional labeling or 
hypothesis (or fantasy) might well undergo modification (assuming nothing actually 
punishing or determinately threatening occurs); such modification constitutes further and 
more detailed learning. Anxiety recedes, in the absence of punishment or further threat 
(including novelty); hope occupies the affective forefront, accompanied by the desire to 
move forward, and to explore (under the governance of the left hemisphere). 

The right hemisphere appears capable of dealing with less determinate information. It 
can use forms of cognition that are more diffuse, more global 157 and more encompassing 
to come to terms initially with what cannot yet be understood but undeniably exists. The 
right hemisphere uses its capacity for massive generalization and comprehension of 
imagery to place the novel stimulus in an initially meaningful context, which is the a 
priori manner of appropriate categorization. This context is defined by the motivational 
significance of the novel thing, which is revealed first by the mere fact of novelty (which 
makes it both threatening and promising) and then in the course of its detailed 
exploration. The right hemisphere remains concerned with the question “what is this new 
thing like?” (meaning “what should be done in the presence of this unexpected 
occurrence?”) and does not care “what is this thing objectively?” “What is the new thing 
like” means “is it dangerous, or threatening (first and foremost), satisfying or 
promising?” Categorization according to valence means that the thing is what it signifies 
for behavior.

The chaos that constitutes the unknown is rendered predictable—is turned into the 
“world"—by the generation of adaptive behaviors and modes of representation. It is the 
process of novelty-driven exploration that, in the individual case, produces such 
behaviors and strategies of classification. However, we are not only individuals. We exist 
in a very complex social environment, characterized by the constant exchange of 
information regarding the means and ends of “proper” adaptation. The human capacity 
for the generation of self-regulatory behavior and representation has been expanded 
immensely, in some ways beyond our own comprehension, by our capacity for verbal and 
nonverbal communication. We can learn through discussion and by reading—can absorb 
information directly even from our departed but literate ancestors. But there is more—we 
can learn from everyone who acts in the natural course of things or dramatically, and we 
can store the behaviors of individuals we come into contact with (directly, by copying 
them; or indirectly, through the intermediation of narrative and dramatic art forms). It is 
of course our ability to copy, to mimic, 158 that underlies our capacity to do things we do 
not necessarily “understand” (that is, cannot describe explicitly). It is for that reason, in 
part, that we need a “psychology.” 

Patterns of behavioral and representational adaptation are generated in the course of 
active exploration and “contact with the unknown.” These patterns do not necessarily 
remain stable, however, once generated. They are modified and shaped, improved and 
made efficient, as a consequence of their communicative exchange. Individual “a” 
produces a new behavior, “b” modifies it, “c” modifies that, “d” radically changes “c’s” 
modification and so on ad infinitum. The same process applies to representations 
(metaphors, say, or explicit concepts). This means that our exploratory assimilative and 
accommodative processes actually extend over vast periods of time and space. Some of 
this extension—perhaps the most obvious part—is mediated by literacy. An equally 
complex and subtle element, however, is mediated by mimesis. 

Patterns of behavioral adaptation and schemas of classification or representation can 
be derived from the observation of others (and, for that matter, from the observation of 
one-self). How we act in the presence of things, in their constantly shifting and generally 
social context, is what those things mean (or even what they are), before what they mean 
(or what they are) can be more abstractly (or “objectively”) categorized. What a thing is, 
therefore, might be determined (in the absence of more useful information) by 
examination of how action is conducted in its presence, which is to say that if someone 
runs from something it is safe to presume that the thing is dangerous (the action in fact 
defines that presumption). The observation of action patterns undertaken by the members 
of any given social community, including those of the observing subject, therefore 
necessarily allows for the derivation and classification of provisional value schema. If 
you watch someone (even yourself) approach something then you can assume that the 
approached thing is good, at least in some determinate context, even if you don’t know 
anything else about it. Knowing what to do, after all, is classification, before it is 
abstracted: classification in terms of motivational relevance, with the sensory aspects of 
the phenomena serving merely as a cue to recognition of that motivational relevance. 159 

It is certainly the case that many of our skills and our automatized strategies of 
classification are “opaque” to explicit consciousness. The fact of our multiple memory 
systems, and their qualitatively different modes of representation—described later— 
ensures that such is the case. This opaqueness means, essentially, that we “understand” 



Maps of Meaning 71 


more than we “know”; it is for this reason that psychologists continue to depend on 
notions of the “unconscious” to provide explanations for behavior. This 
unconsciousness—the psychoanalytic god—is our capacity for the implicit storage of 
information about the nature and valence of things. This information is generated in the 
course of active exploration, and modified, often unrecognizably, by constant, 
multigenerational, interpersonal communication. We live in social groups; most of our 
interactions are social in nature. We spend most of our time around others and, when we 
are alone, we still wish to understand, predict and control our personal behaviors. Our 
maps of the “understood part of the world” are therefore in large part maps of patterns of 
actions —of behaviors established as a consequence of creative exploration, and modified 
in the course of endless social interactions. We watch ourselves act; from this action, we 
draw inferences about the nature of the world (including those acts that are part of the 
world). 

We know that the right hemisphere—at least its frontal portion—is specialized for 
response to punishment and threat. We also know that damage to the right hemisphere 
impairs our ability to detect patterns and to understand the meaning of stories. 160 Is it too 
much to suggest that the emotional, imagistic and narrative capabilities of the right 
hemisphere play a key role in the initial stages of transforming something novel and 
complex, such as the behaviors of others (or ourselves) and the valence of new things, 
into something thoroughly understood? When we encounter something new, after all, we 
generate fantasies (imagistic, verbal) about its potential nature. This means we attempt to 
determine how the unexpected thing might relate to something we have already 
mastered—or, at least, to other things that we have not yet mastered. To say “this 
unsolved problem appears to be like this other problem we haven’t yet solved” is a step 
on the way to solution. To say, “here is how these (still essentially mysterious) 
phenomena appear to hang together” is an intuition of the sort that precedes detailed 
knowledge; is the capacity to see the forest, though not yet differentiating between the 
types of trees. Before we truly master something novel (which means, before we can 
effectively limit its indeterminate significance to something predictable, even irrelevant) 
we imagine what it might be. Our imaginative representations actually constitute our 
initial adaptations. Our fantasies comprise part of the structure that we use to inhibit our 
responses to the a priori significance of the unknown (even as such fantasies facilitate 
generation of more detailed and concrete information). There is no reason to presuppose 
that we have been able to explicitly comprehend this capacity, in part because it actually 
seems to serve as a necessary ; or axiomatic precondition for the ability to comprehend, 
explicitly. 

The uniquely specialized capacities of the right hemisphere appear to allow it to derive 
from repeated observations of behavior images of action patterns that the verbal left can 
arrange, with increasingly logic and detail, into stories. A story is a map of meaning, a 
“strategy” for emotional regulation and behavioral output—a description of how to act in 
a circumstance, to ensure that the circumstance retains its positive motivational salience 
(or at least has its negative qualities reduced to the greatest possible degree). The story 
appears generated, in its initial stages, by the capacity for imagery and pattern recognition 
characteristic of the right hemisphere, which is integrally involved in narrative 
cognition 161 and in processes that aid or are analogous to such cognition. The right 
hemisphere has the ability to decode the nonverbal and melodic aspects of speech, to 



Maps of meaning 72 


empathize (or to engage, more generally, in interpersonal relationships), and the capacity 
to comprehend imagery, metaphor and analogy. 162 The left-hemisphere “linguistic” 
systems “finish” the story, adding logic, proper temporal order, internal consistency, 
verbal representation, and possibility for rapid abstract explicit communication. In this 
way, our explicit knowledge of value is expanded, through the analysis of our own 
“dreams.” Interpretations that “work”—that is, that improve our capacity to regulate our 
own emotions (to turn the current world into the desired world, to say it differently)— 
qualify as valid. It is in this manner that we verify the accuracy of our increasingly 
abstracted presumptions. 

The process of creative exploration—the timet ion of the knower, so to speak, who 
generates explored territory—has as its apparent purpose an increase in the breadth of 
motoric repertoire (skill) and alteration of representational schema. Each of these two 
purposes appears served by the construction of a specific form of knowledge, and its 
subsequent storage in permanent memory. The first form has been described as knowing 
how. The motor unit, charged with origination of new behavioral strategies when old 
strategies fail (when they produce undesired results), produces alternate action patterns, 
experimentally applied, to bring about the desired result. Permanent instantiation of the 
new behavior, undertaken if the behavior is successful, might be considered development 
of new skill. Knowing how is skill. The second type of knowing, which is representational 
(an image or model of something, rather than the thing itself) has been described as 
knowing that 163 —I prefer knowing what. Exploration of a novel circumstance, event or 
thing produces new sensory and affective input, during active or abstracted interaction of 
the exploring subject and the object in question. This new sensory input constitutes 
grounds for the construction, elaboration and update of a permanent but modifiable four¬ 
dimensional (spatial and temporal) representational model of the experiential field, in its 
present and potential future manifestations. This model, I would propose, is a story. 

It is the hippocampal system—which, as we have seen, is an integral part of the 
regulation of anxiety—that is critically involved in the transfer of information from 
observation of ongoing activity to permanent memory, 164 and that provides the 
physiological basis (in concert with the higher cortical structures) for the development 
and elaboration of this mnestic representation. It is the right hemisphere, which is 
activated by the unknown, and which can generate patterns rapidly, that provides the 
initial imagery—the contents of fantasy—for the story. It is the left hemisphere that gives 
these patterns structure and communicability (as it does, for example, when it interprets a 
painting, a novel, a drama or a conversation). The hippocampus notes mismatch; this 
disinhibits the amygdala (perhaps not directly). Such disinhibition “releases” anxiety and 
curiosity, driving exploration. The right hemisphere, under these conditions of 
motivation, derives patterns relevant to encapsulation of the emergent unknown, from the 
information at its disposal. Much of this information can be extracted from the social 
environment, and the behavioral interactions and strategies of representation—emergent 
properties of exploration and communication—that are “embedded” in the social 
structure. Much of this “information” is still implicit—that is, coded in behavioral 
pattern. It is still knowing how, before it has been abstracted and made explicit as 
knowing what. The left hemisphere gets increasingly involved, as translation “up the 
hierarchy of abstraction” occurs.

Knowing-how information, described alternatively as procedural, habitual, 
dispositional, or skilled, and knowing-what information, described alternatively as 
declarative, episodic, factual, autobiographical, or representational, appear 
physiologically distinct in their material basis, and separable in course of phylo- and 
ontogenetic development. 165 Procedural knowledge develops long before declarative 
knowledge, in evolution and individual development, and appears represented in 
“unconscious” form, expressible purely in performance. Declarative knowledge, by 
contrast—knowledge of what—simultaneously constitutes consciously accessible and 
communicable episodic imagination (the world in fantasy) and subsumes even more 
recently developed semantic (linguistically mediated) knowledge, whose operations, in 
large part, allow for abstract representation and communication of the contents of the 
imagination. Squire and Zola-Morgan 166 have represented the relationship between these 
memory forms according to the schematic of Figure 12: The Multiple Structure of 
Memory} 61 The neuroanatomical basis of knowing how remains relatively unspecified. 
Skill generation appears in part as the domain of the cortical pre/motor unit; “storage” 
appears to involve the cerebellum. Knowing what, by contrast, appears dependent for its 
existence on the intact function of the cortical sensory unit, in interplay with the 
hippocampal system. 168 Much of our knowing what, however—our description of the 
world— is about knowing how, which is behavioral knowledge, wisdom. Much of our 
descriptive knowledge—representational knowledge—is representation of what 
constitutes wisdom (without being that wisdom, itself). We have gained our description 
of wisdom by watching how we act, in our culturally governed social interactions, and by 
representing those actions. 

We know how, which means how to act to transform the mysterious and ever- 
threatening world of the present into what we desire, long before we know how we know 
how, or why we know how. This is to say, for example, that a child learns to act 
appropriately (assuming it does) long before it can provide abstracted explanations for or 
descriptions of its behavior. 169 A child can be “good” without being a moral philosopher. 
This idea echoes the developmental psychologist Jean Piaget’s notion, with regard to 
child development, that adaptation at the sensorimotor level occurs prior to—and lays the 
groundwork for—the more abstracted forms of adaptation that characterize adulthood. 
Piaget regarded imagistic representation as

an intermediary between sensorimotor intelligence and the (highest or most abstract) 
stage of “formal operations”; furthermore, he believed that imitation—the “acting out” of 
an object—served as a necessary prerequisite to such imagistic representation (portrayal 
in image or word, instead of behavior). The process of play appears as a higher-order, or 
more abstract form of imitation, from this perspective. Piaget presents two main theses: 

The first is that in the field of play and imitation it is possible to trace the 
transition from sensory-motor assimilation and accommodation to the 
mental assimilation and accommodation which characterize the 
beginnings of representation.... [The second is that] the various forms of 
representation interact. There is representation when an absent model is 
imitated. There is representation in symbolic play, in imagination and 
even in dreams, the systems of concepts and logical relations, both in their 
intuitive and operational forms, implies representation. 170 

Piaget believed that imitation could be described in terms of accommodation: “If there is 
primacy of accommodation (matching of behavior) over assimilation (altering of 
schemas) ...the activity tends to become imitation.” 171 This implies that the imitating 
child in fact embodies more information than he “understands” (represents). He 
continues: “representation ...can be seen to be a kind of interiorized imitation, and 
therefore a continuation of accommodation.” 172 [With regard to the three-memory-system 
model (which Piaget is of course not directly referring to): “even if there were 
justification for relating the various stages of mental development to well-defined 
neurological levels, the fact remains that, in spite of the relative discontinuity of the 








Maps of Meaning 75 


structures, there is a certain functional continuity, each structure preparing for its 
successors while utilizing its predecessors.” 173 ] 

What can be said of children appears true, more or less, phylogenetically: our cultures 
(which we absorb as children, through the processes of imitation) consist primarily of 
patterns of activity, undertaken in a social context. As parents are to children, cultures are 
to adults: we do not know how the patterns we act out (or the concepts we utilize) 
originated, or what precise “purposes” (what long-term “goals”) they currently serve. 
Such patterns are in fact “emergent properties” of long-term social interactions. 
Furthermore, we cannot describe such patterns well, abstractly (explicitly, semantically), 
even though we duplicate them accurately (and unconsciously) in our behavior (and can 
represent them, episodically, in our literary endeavors). We do not know why we do what 
we do, or, to say the same thing, what it is that we are (all ideological theories to the 
contrary). We watch ourselves, and wonder; our wonder takes the shape of the story or, 
more fundamentally, the myth. Myths describing the known, explored territory, constitute 
what we know about our knowing how, before we can state, explicitly, what it is that we 
know how. Myth is, in part, the image of our adaptive action, as formulated by 
imagination, before its explicit containment in abstract language; myth is the 
intermediary between action and abstract linguistic representation of that action. Myth is 
the distilled essence of the stories we tell ourselves about the patterns of our own 
behavior, as they play themselves out in the social and impersonal worlds of experience. 
We learn the story, which we do not understand (which is to say, cannot make explicit), 
by watching. We represent the action patterns we encounter in action (that is ritual), 
image and word: we act, then represent our behavior, ever more abstractly, ever more 
explicitly, “consciously.” 

The central features of our (socially determined) behavior thus become key 
elements—characters—in our stories. The generation and constant refinement of these 
stories, told and retold over centuries, allows us to determine ever more clearly just what 
proper (and improper) behavior consists of, in an environment permanently characterized 
by the interplay between security and unpredictability. We are extremely (uncontrollably) 
imitative, overwhelmingly social and interminably exploratory. These characteristics 
allow us to generate and communicate represented images, and, simultaneously, serve as 
the focal point of inquiry for those images. Our capacity for creative action frees us, 
constantly, from the ever-shifting demands of the “environment.” The ability to represent 
creative action—to duplicate observed creativity in our own actions, and to represent that 
creativity in detail and essence—allows everyone to benefit from the creative action of 
everyone else (at least everyone with whom communication might conceivably take 
place). The fact of our sociability ensures that our adaptive behaviors are structured with 
the social community in mind, at least in the long run, and increases our chances of 
exposure to creative intelligence. We observe others acting in a manner we find 
admirable, and duplicate their actions. In this manner, we obtain the skills of others. Our 
capacity for abstraction allows us to take our facility for imitation one step further, 
however: we can learn to imitate not only the precise behaviors that constitute adaptation, 
but the process by which those behaviors were generated. This means—we can learn not 
only skill, but meta-skill (can learn to mimic the pattern of behavior that generates new 
skills). It is the encapsulation of meta-skill in a story that makes that story great. 



Maps of meaning 76 


Our imitative proclivity, expressed in behavior, appears to find its more abstracted 
counterpart in the ability to admire, which is a permanent, innate or easily acquired 
constituent element of our intrapsychic state. This capability for awe, this desire to copy, 
often serves to impel further psychological and cognitive development. The worshipful 
attitude that small boys adopt toward their heroes, for example, constitutes the outward 
expression of the force that propels them toward embodying, or incarnating (or even 
inventing) oft ill-defined heroic qualities themselves. The capacity for imitation surfaces 
in more abstract guise in the human tendency to act “as-if’ 174 —to identify with another— 
to become another, in fantasy (which means, to ritually identify with or unconsciously 
adopt the story of another). (This means—the ability to adopt someone else’s goal, as if it 
were yours. 175 ) The capacity to act “as if’ expresses itself in admiration (ranging in 
intensity from the simple respect accorded a competent other, to abject worship) and, 
even more abstractly, in ideological possession. No independent “instinct” necessarily 
needs to be postulated, to account for this mimetic ability (although one may well exist): 
all that may be necessary is the capacity to observe that another has obtained a goal that 
is also valued by the observer (that observation provides the necessary motivation), and 
the skill to duplicate the procedures observed to lead to such fulfillment. 

Mimetic propensity, expressed in imitative action, provides for tremendous expansion 
of behavioral competence 176 ; allows the ability of each to become the capability’ of all. 
Precise duplicative facility, however, still retains pronounced limitations. Specific 
behaviors retain their adaptive significance only within particular, restricted 
environments (only within bounded frames of reference). If environmental contingencies 
shift (for whatever reason), the utility of strategies designed for the original circumstance 
(and transmitted through imitation) may become dramatically restricted or even reversed. 
The capacity for abstraction of imitation—which is, in the initial stages, capability for 
dramatic play—overcomes the specific restrictions of exact imitation, elaborating 
reproduction of particular acts, removing the behavior to be copied from its initial 
specific context, establishing its first-level declarative representation and generalization. 
Play allows for the permanent extension of competence and confidence through pretense, 
which means through metaphoric and symbolic action (which is semantic use of episodic 
representation), and for natural expansion of behavioral range from safe, predictable, self- 
defined contexts, out toward the unknown world of experience. Play creates a world in 
“rule-governed” fantasy—in episodic or imagistic representation—in which behavior can 
be rehearsed and mastered, prior to its expression in the real world, with real-world 
consequences. Play is another form of “as-if’ behavior, that allows for experimentation 
with fictional narrative—pretended descriptions of the current and desired future states of 
the world, with plans of action appended, designed to change the former into the latter. 
To play means to set—or to fictionally transform—“fictional” goals. Such fictional goals 
give valence to phenomena that would, in other contexts, remain meaningless (valence 
that is informative, with-out being serious). Play allows us to experiment with means and 
ends themselves, without subjecting ourselves to the actual consequences of “real” 
behavior, and to benefit emotionally, in the process. The goals of play are not real; the 
incentive rewards, however, that accompany movement to a pretended goal—these are 
real (although bounded, like game-induced anxieties). The bounded reality of such affect 
accounts, at least in part, for the intrinsic interest that motivates and accompanies play (or 
immersion in any dramatic activity). 



Maps of Meaning 77 


Play transcends imitation in that it is less context-bound; it allows for the abstraction 
of essential principles from specific (admirable) instances of behavior. Play allows for the 
initial establishment of a more general model of what constitutes allowable (or ideal) 
behavior. Elaboration of dramatic play into formal drama likewise ritualizes play, 
abstracting its key elements one level more, and further distills the vitally interesting 
aspects of behavior—which are representative (by no mere chance) of that active 
exploratory and communicative pattern upon which all adaptation is necessarily 
predicated. Theatrical ritual dramatically represents the individual and social 
consequences of stylized, distilled behavioral patterns, based in their expression upon 
different assumptions of value and expectations of outcome. Formal drama clothes potent 
ideas in personality, exploring different paths of directed or motivated action, playing out 
conflict, cathartically, offering ritual models for emulation or rejection. Dramatic 
personae embody the behavioral wisdom of history. In an analogous fashion, in a less 
abstract, less ritualized manner, the ongoing behavior of parents dramatizes cumulative 
mimetic history for children. 

Emergence of narrative, which contains much more information than it explicitly 
presents, tint her disembodies the knowledge extant latently in behavioral pattern. 
Narrative presents semantic representation of play or drama—offers essentially 
abstracted episodic representations of social interaction and individual endeavor—and 
allows behavioral patterns contained entirely in linguistic representation to incarnate 
themselves in dramatic form on the private stage of individual imagination. Much of the 
information derived from a story is actually already contained in episodic memory. In a 
sense, it could be said that the words of the story merely act as a retrieval cue for 
information already in the mnestic system (of the listener), although perhaps not yet 
transformed into a form capable either of explicit (semantic) communication, or alteration 
of procedure. It is for this reason that Shakespeare might be viewed as a precursor 
to Freud (think of Hamlet): Shakespeare “knew” what Freud later “discovered,” but he 
knew it more implicitly, more imagistically, more procedurally. (This is not say that 
Shakespeare was any less brilliant, just that his level of abstraction was different.) Ideas, 
after all, come from somewhere; they do not arise, spontaneously, from the void. Every 
complex psychological theory has a lengthy period of historical development 
(development that might not be evidently linked to the final emergence of the theory). 

Interpretation of the reason for dramatic consequences, portrayed in narrative— 
generally left to the imagination of the audience—constitutes analysis of the moral of the 
story. Transmission of that moral—that rule for behavior, or representation—is the 
purpose of narrative, just as fascination, involuntary seizure of interest, is its (biologically 
predetermined) means. With development of the story, mere description of critically 
important (and therefore compelling) behavioral/representational patterns becomes able 
to promote active imitation. At this point the semantic system, activating images in 
episodic memory, sets the stage for the alteration of procedure itself. This means 
establishment of a “feedback loop,” wherein information can cycle up and down “levels 
of consciousness”—with the social environment as necessary intermediary— 
transforming itself and expanding as it moves. Development of narrative means verbal 
abstraction of knowledge disembodied in episodic memory and embodied in behavior. It 
means capability to disseminate such knowledge widely and rapidly throughout a 
communicating population, with minimal expenditure of time and energy. Finally, it 



Maps of meaning 78 


means intact preservation of such knowledge, simply and accurately, for generations to 
come. Narrative description of archetypal behavioral patterns and representational 
schemas— myth —appears as an essential precondition for social construction and 
subsequent regulation of complexly civilized individual presumption, action and desire. 

It is only after behavioral (procedural) wisdom has become “represented” in episodic 
memory and portrayed in drama and narrative that it becomes accessible to “conscious” 
verbal formulation and potential modification in abstraction. Procedural knowledge is not 
representational, in its basic form. Knowing-how information, generated in the course of 
exploratory activity, can nonetheless be transferred from individual to individual, in the 
social community, through means of imitation. Piaget points out, for example, that 
children first act upon objects, and determine object “properties” in accordance with 
these actions, and then almost immediately imitate themselves, turning their own initial 
spontaneous actions into something to be represented and ritualized. 179 The same process 
occurs in interpersonal interaction, where the other persons action rapidly becomes 
something to be imitated and ritualized (and then abstracted and codified further). A 
shared rite, where each person’s behavior is modified by that of the other, can therefore 
emerge in the absence of “consciousness” of the structure of the rite; however, once the 
social ritual is established, its structure can rapidly become described and codified 
(presuming sufficient cognitive ability and level of maturation). This process can in fact 
be observed during the spontaneous construction (and then codification) of children’s 
games. 180 It is the organization of such “games”—and their elaboration, through repeated 
communication—that constitutes the basis for the construction of culture itself. 

Behavior is imitated, then abstracted into play, formalized into drama and story, 
crystallized into myth and codified into religion—and only then criticized in philosophy, 
and provided, post-hoc, with rational underpinnings. Explicit philosophical statements 
regarding the grounds for and nature of ethical behavior, stated in a verbally 
comprehensible manner, were not established through rational endeavor. Their framing as 
such is (clearly) a secondary endeavor, as Nietzsche recognized: 

What the scholars called a “rational foundation for morality” and tried to 
supply was, seen in the right light, merely a scholarly expression of the 
common faith in the prevalent morality; a new means of expression for 
this faith. 181 

Explicit (moral) philosophy arises from the mythos of culture, grounded in procedure, 
rendered progressively more abstract and episodic through ritual action and observation 
of that action. The process of increasing abstraction has allowed the knowing what 
“system” to generate a representation, in imagination, of the “implicit predicates” of 
behavior governed by the knowing how “system.” Generation of such information was 
necessary to simultaneously ensure accurate prediction of the behavior of others (and of 
the self), and to program predictable social behavior through exchange of abstracted 
moral (procedural) information. Nietzsche states, further: 

That individual philosophical concepts are not anything capricious or 
autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with 
each other; that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in 



Maps of Meaning 79 


the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system 
as all the members of the fauna of a continent—is betrayed in the end also 
by the fact that the most diverse philosophers keep filling in a definite 
fundamental scheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible spell, 
they always revolve once more in the same orbit; however independent of 
each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, 
something within them leads them, something impels them in a definite 
order, one after the other—to wit, the innate systematic structure and 
relationship of their concepts. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a 
discovery than a recognition, a remembering, a return and a homecoming 
to a remote, primordial, and inclusive household of the soul, out of which 
those concepts grew originally: philosophizing is to this extent a kind of 
atavism of the highest order. 1S2 

The knowing-what system, declarative (episodic and semantic), has developed a 
description of knowing-how activity, procedure, through a complex, lengthy process of 
abstraction. Action and imitation of action developmentally predate explicit description 
or discovery of the rules governing action. Adaptation through play and drama preceded 
development of linguistic thought, and provided the ground from which it emerged. Each 
developmental “stage”—action, imitation, play, ritual, drama, narrative, myth, religion, 
philosophy, rationality—offers an increasingly abstracted, generalized and detailed 
representation of the behavioral wisdom embedded in and established during the previous 
stage. The introduction of semantic representation to the human realm of behavior 
allowed for continuance and ever-increasing extension of the cognitive process 
originating in action, imitation, play, and drama. Language turned drama into mythic 
narrative, narrative into formal religion, and religion into critical philosophy, providing 
for exponential expansion of adaptive ability. Consider Nietzsche’s words once again: 

Gradually it has become clear to me what every great philosophy so far 
has been: namely, the personal confession of its author and a kind of 
involuntary and unconscious memoir; also that the moral (or immoral) 
intentions in every philosophy constituted the real germ of life from which 
the whole plant had grown. 1Sj

Figure 13: Abstraction of Wisdom, and the 

Relationship of Such Abstraction to 
Memory 

The procedural system provides (constitutes?) memory for behavior. Such memory 
includes imitative representation of behaviors generated spontaneously in the course of 
creative individual action, whose precise circumstance of origins have been lost in the 
mists of history, but which have been integrated into a consistent behavioral pattern, over 
time (integrated into culturally determined character). Integration means active balance 
of competing subjectively grounded motivational demands within the context of the 
social environment, means internalization of socially regulated behavioral expression of 
subjective desire. Such internalization constitutes construction of a value (dominance) 
hierarchy; means determination of the relative contextual propriety (morality) of imitated 
or otherwise incorporated patterns of action. Such construction inevitably “precedes” 
episodic or semantic representation of the basis of the construction, although such 
second-order representation, once established, becomes capable (indirectly) of modifying 
procedure itself (as what is imagined can then be acted out). This is the loop that feeds 
the development of explicit “consciousness” itself: procedure is established, then 
represented, then altered in abstraction, then practiced; the procedure changes, as a 
consequence of the abstracted and practiced modification; this change in turn produces an 
alteration in its representation, and so on, and so on, from individual to individual, down 
the chain of generations. This process can occur “externally,” as a consequence of social 








Maps of Meaning 81 


interaction, or “internally,” as a consequence of word and image-mediated abstract 
exploratory activity (“thought”). This interactive loop and its putative relationship to 
underlying cognitive/memory structures are represented schematically in Figure 13: 
Abstraction of Wisdom, and the Relationship of Such Abstraction to Memory. (Only a 
few of the interactions between the “stages” of knowledge are indicated, for the sake of 
schematic simplicity.) 

Behavioral knowledge is generated during the process of creative exploration. The 
consequences of such exploration—the adaptive behavioral patterns generated—are 
imitated, and represented more abstractly. Play allows for the generalization of imitated 
knowledge, and for the integration of behaviors garnered from different sources (one 
“good thing to do” may conflict in a given situation with another; “good things to do” 
therefore have to be ranked in terms of their context-dependent value, importance or 
dominance). Each succeeding stage of abstraction modifies all others, as our ability to 
speak, for example, has expanded our capacity to play. As the process of abstraction 
continues and information vital for survival is represented more simply and efficiently, 
what is represented transforms from the particulars of any given adaptive actions to the 
most general and broadly appropriate pattern of adaptation—that of creative exploration 
itself. This is to say: individual acts of voluntary and successful encounter with the 
unknown might be broadly imitated; might elicit spontaneous imitation. But some more 
essential (“prototypical” 184 ) feature(s) characterize all such acts. With increasing 
abstraction and breadth of representation, essential features come to dominate particular 
features. As Eliade 183 points out, traditional (that is, nonliterate) cultures have a historical 
memory that may be only a few generations long—that is, as long as the oldest surviving 
individual is old. Events that occurred previous to this are telescoped into something akin 
to the aboriginal Australian’s “dreamtime,” the “trans-historical” period when ancestral 
giants walked the earth and established the behavioral patterns comprising the present 
mode of being. This telescoping, the “mythologization” of history, is very useful from the 
perspective of efficient storage. We learn to imitate (and to remember) not individual 
heroes, the “objective” historical figures of the past, but what those heroes represented: 
the pattern of action that made them heroes. That pattern is the act of voluntary and 
successful encounter with the unknown, the generation of wisdom through exploration. (I 
am not trying to imply, either, that the semantic or episodic memory systems can directly 
modify procedure; it is more that the operations of the semantic/episodic systems alter the 
world, and world alterations alter procedure. The effect of language and image on 
behavior is generally secondary—mediated through the environment—but is no less 
profound for that.) 

The fact that the many “stories” we live by can be coded and transmitted at different 
levels of “abstraction,” ranging from the purely motoric or procedural (transmitted 
through imitation) to the more purely semantic (transmitted through the medium of 
explicit ethical philosophy, say) makes comprehension of their structure and inter¬ 
relationships conceptually difficult. This difficulty is compounded by the fact that 
different stories have different spatial-temporal “resolutions”—that is, we may be 
governed at one moment by short-term, simple considerations and at the next by longer- 
term, more complex considerations. Someone married might think, for example, “I find 
my friend’s spouse particularly attractive; I would like to make love to him or her”— 
evaluating that individual, positively—and then, immediately, correct: “My friend’s 



Maps of meaning 82 


spouse flirts too much for his or her own good, and looks like a lot of trouble.” Perhaps 
both these viewpoints are valid. It is certainly not uncommon for the same “stimulus” to 
possess competing valences. Otherwise, as I said before, we would never have to think. 

Every apprehensible phenomenon has a multitude of potential uses and significances. 
It is for this reason that it is possible for each of us to drown in possibility. Even 
something as simple as a piece of paper is not simple at all, except insofar as implicit 
contextual determinants make it appear so. Wittgenstein asks: 

Point to a piece of paper.—And now point to its shape—now to its 
colour—now to its number (that sounds queer).—How did you do it?— 

You will say that you “meant” a different thing each time you pointed. 

And if I ask how that is done, you will say you concentrated your 
attention on the colour, the shape, etc. But I ask again: how is that 
done? 186 

A kitchen knife, for example: is it something to cut up vegetables, at dinner? Something 
to draw, for a still life? A toy, for mumblety-peg? A screwdriver, to fix a shelf? An 
implement of murder? In the first four cases, it “possesses” a positive valence. In the last 
case, it is negative—unless you are experiencing a frenzy of rage. How is its essential 
functional and affective multiplicity reduced to something singular and, therefore, useful? 
You can’t fix the shelf and make dinner at the same time, and in the same place. You may 
need to do both, at some point, however, and this means that you must maintain the 
multiple uses and valences as possibilities. This means that you must (1) decide on one 
course of action, and eliminate all the rest, yet (2) retain the others for future 
consideration to ensure that your range of possible actions remain as broad as possible. 

How is this ever-present competition to be ameliorated? How might the process of 
amelioration be considered, with regard to the additional complicating fact of the 
multilevel embodiment and abstraction of stories? So far we have considered the “ends” 
and the “means” of a given framework of reference (a story) as qualitatively different 
phenomena, echoing a dilemma that pervades ethics, as a field of study. The end or goal 
of a given planned sequence of behavior constitutes an image of the desired future, which 
serves as point of contrast, for the unbearable present. The means by which this end 
might be attained comprises the actual behavioral steps that might be undertaken, in 
pursuit of such desirable change. This seems a very reasonable perspective, in that at any 
given moment means and ends might be usefully distinguished. Where we are going is 
evidently different than how we will get there. This conceptual utility is only provisional, 
however—and the fact of the “means/end” distinction actually obscures more detailed 
and comprehensive description. Means and ends, plans and goals, are not qualitatively 
different, in any final sense, and can be transformed, one into the other, at any moment. 
Such transformation occurs, in fact, whenever a problem arises: whenever the unknown 
manifests itself in the course of our ongoing behavior. It is in this manner that we switch 
spatial-temporal resolution (change “set” or shift our “frames of reference”), in order to 
re-evaluate our actions, and reconsider the propriety of our wishes. 

Our stories—our frames of reference—appear to have a “nested” or hierarchical 
structure. At any given moment, our attention occupies only one level of that structure. 
This capacity for restricted attention gives us the capability to make provisional but 



Maps of Meaning 83 


necessary judgments about the valence and utility of phenomena. However, we can also 
shift levels of abstraction —we can voluntarily focus our attention, when necessary, on 
stories that map out larger or smaller areas of space-time (excuse the Einsteinian 
reference, but it is in fact accurate in this case, as our stories have a duration, as well as 
an area). “When necessary” means depending on the status of our current operations. For 
example, say you are in the kitchen, and you want to read a book in your study. An image 
of you reading a book in your favorite chair occupies the “ends” or “desired future” pole 
of your currently operational story (contrasted with the still-too-illiterate you of the 
present time). This “story” might have a conceived duration of, say, ten minutes; in 
addition, it “occupies” a universe defined by the presence of a half-dozen relevant 
“objects” (a reading lamp, a chair, the floor you have to walk on to get to your chair, the 
book itself, your reading glasses) and the limited space they occupy. You make it to your 
chair. Your book is at hand. You reach up to turn on the reading light—flash!—the bulb 
burns out. The unknown—the unexpected, in this context—has just manifested itself. 
You switch “set.” Now your goal, still nested within the “reading a book” story, is “fix 
the reading lamp.” You adjust your plans, find a new bulb, and place it in the lamp. 
Flash! It burns out again. This time you smell burnt wire. This is worrisome. The book is 
now forgotten—irrelevant, given the current state of affairs. Is there something wrong 
with the lamp (and, therefore, at a slightly more general level, with all future plans that 
depend on that lamp)? You explore. The lamp doesn’t smell. It’s the electrical outlet, in 
the wall! The plate covering the outlets is hot! What does that mean? You shift your 
apprehension up several levels of spatial-temporal resolution. Maybe something is wrong 
with the wiring of the house itself! The lamp is now forgotten. Ensuring that your house 
does not burn down has suddenly taken priority. How does this shift in attention occur? 

Figure 14: Conceptual Transformation of the Means/Ends Relationship from Static 
to Dynamic presents a tripartite schematic, designed to take us from the state where we 
conceptualize means and ends as distinct, to the state where we see them as isomorphic 
elements, given distinct status only on a provisional basis. Subdiagram (1) is familiar and 
represents the “normal” story, composed of present state, desired future state, and three of 
the various means that might be utilized, in order to transform the former into the latter. 
This subdiagram is predicated on the presumption that many means might be used to get 
from point “a” to point “b”; in truth, however, only one means (the “most efficient” or 
otherwise desirable) will be employed at any one time. (We only have one motor output 
system, after all—and, therefore, one “consciousness”?) Subdiagram (2) is a transformed 
version of (1), showing that the “plans” of (1) can better be conceptualized as “stories,” 
in and of

themselves—showing that a “big” story (one that occupies a large spatial-temporal 
domain) is actually composed of nested “little” stories. Subdiagram (2) is still predicated 
on the presumption that a number of smaller stories might be used as means for a larger 
end. If your company is failing, you might fire half your employees, branch out into a 
new product line, or cut the salaries of your upper management. Each of these 
approaches, all designed for the same purpose, are clearly different (and complex) in their 
internal structure. You might do more than one thing, but if two of these multiple things 
conflict, one will have to be made subordinate to the other. Plans (and ends) are granted 
comparative importance, and organized accordingly. This state of affairs, where the 
relative importance of (potentially competing) plans has been fixed, is represented in 
subdiagram (3), which will remain our representation of choice. 187 

At any given place and time, we are considering only a fixed number of “variables” as 
means and ends. This is absolutely necessary, as action requires exclusion as much (or 
more) as inclusion. 188 However, those things we consider as “relevant variables” (and 
their status as relevant, or not) have to be mutable. We have to decide, yet retain the 
capacity to alter our decisions. Our prefrontal cortex—critical to goal-directed action 189 — 
appears to allow us this freedom: it does so, by “temporally sequencing” events and

actions, 190 by considering contextual information and using that consideration to govern 
behavior, 191 and by shifting set. 192 It performs this multiplicity of operations, I submit, by 
considering one thing, then another, as the currently operative “consummatory reward”— 
as the goal toward which behavior is to be devoted, as the “desired future” against which 
the “unbearable present,” in the form of emergent experience, is to be compared and 
evaluated. The structure in Figure 14, subdiagram (3), is a multilevel, nested structure, 
composed of the interdependent goals and plans comprising the “life story.” This 
conceptualization helps explain the idea of a “step along the way” (a stairway or ladder to 
heaven, metaphorically speaking). 19 ' 

Each step—each substory—has the same structure (but not the same content) as all 
those stories “above” and “below.” This means that all the elements of a “good” story 
might be expected to mirror, in some profound manner, all the other elements: that a 
story, like the world itself, might be read (and read correctly) at multiple and multiply 
informative levels of analysis. This gives good stories their polysemous quality. It is for 
this reason that Frye can state: 

One of the commonest experiences in reading is the sense of further 
discoveries to be made within the same structure of words. The feeling is 
approximately “there is more to be got out of this,” or we may say, of 
something we particularly admire, that every time we read it we get 
something new out of it. 194 

A phenomenon that constitutes a goal at one level might be regarded as an incentive 
reward at the next, since the attainment of subsidiary goals are preconditions for the 
attainment of higher-level goals (this implies that most consummatory rewards will 
simultaneously possess an incentive aspect). The cognitive operations dependent upon 
the intact prefrontal cortex can move up and down these levels, so to speak, fixating at 
one, and allowing for determinate action, when that is deemed most appropriate (making 
the others implicit at that place and time); reorganizing and reconstituting the levels and 
their respective statuses, when that becomes necessary. Figure 15: Bounded Revolution 
sheds light on this process and, simultaneously, on the conundrum of relative novelty. 
How can a thing be radically new, somewhat new, somewhat familiar, or completely 
familiar? The simple answer is—a given phenomenon (a “thing” or “situation”) can have 
its utility and/or meaning transformed at one level of analysis, but not at another. This 
means that novelty can be “bounded”; that something can be new in one manner, but 
remain familiar at another. This upper “familiar” level provides “walls” of security. 
These walls enclose a bounded territory, within which necessary change can occur, 
without fear of catastrophe. 

Here is an exemplary “story”: I am an undergraduate. I want to be a doctor. I am not 
sure exactly why, but that question has never become relevant (which is to say, my desire 
is an implicit presumption, an axiom of my behavior). I did well in high school. I have 
good marks in university, as a pre-med student. I take the MCAT. I fail: twentieth 
percentile. Suddenly and unexpectedly I realize that I am not going to be a doctor. The 
walls come tumbling

Figure 15: Bounded Revolution 

down. My emotions, which were held in check by the determinate valences my ongoing 
story gave to experiential phenomena, now (re)emerge, viciously—in chaos. I am a 
depressed and anxious wreck. As I recover, I re-evaluate my life. I am disciplined and 
have good academic skills. I like university; I like working with people. Many of the 
predicates of the doctor story are still intact and do not need modification. I must journey 
further up the hierarchy, then!—maybe, for the first time. We do not question a story, 
when it is working! If it produces the desired results, it is correct ! Why did I want to be a 
doctor? For monetary security. Because it was expected of me (for reasons of tradition— 
my father was a doctor). For reasons of status. Because I could appease the suffering of 
others and be a good person. So—hierarchical organization [this takes (or even is) 
thought]: (1) I want to help people; (2) I need some monetary security; (3) I would like to 
stay in the health profession; (4) perhaps status is not as important as I thought (and 
might therefore be “sacrificed,” to appease the angry gods and restore order to the 
cosmos). I will become a medical technician or maybe even a nurse. I can still be a “good 
person” even if I’m not a doctor, and perhaps that is the most important thing of all. 
Reorganization completed. Utility of experiential phenomena re-established. Emotional 
integrity and stability reattained. Good thing I didn’t do anything rash! 

It is interesting and instructive to consider Eastern representations of reality (that is, of 
the “cosmos”) in light of this conceptualization. Reality is made up of nested 
interpretations, that give determinate form to objects (as implements) and to the valence 
of those objects. Every interpretation, however, is subject to transformation, at every 
level. This constant (and necessary) transformation, in conjunction with the fact of at 





Maps of Meaning 87 


least transient (and necessary) stability, makes up the “world.” Mircea Eliade describes 
the Indian version of the doctrine of the “eternal return”—the endlessly nested, cyclical 
nature of the “universe” (conceived of as the totality of experience, and not as “objective 
reality”): 

A complete cycle, a mahayuga, comprises 12,000 years. It ends with a 
dissolution, a pralaya, which is repeated more drastically ( mahapralaya, 
the Great Dissolution) at the end of the thousandth cycle. For the 
paradigmatic schema “creation-destruction-creation-etc.” is reproduced ad 
infinitum. The 12,000 years of a mahayuga were regarded as divine years, 
each with a duration of 360 years, which gives a total of 4,320,000 years 
for a single cosmic cycle. A thousand such mahayugas make up a kalpa 
(form); 14 kalpas make up a manvantara (so named because each 
manvantara is supposed to be ruled by Manu, the mythical Ancestor- 
King). A kalpa is equivalent to a day in the life of Brahma; a second kalpa 
to a night. One hundred of these “years” of Brahma, in other words 
311,000 milliards of human years, constitute the life of Brahma. But even 
this duration of the god’s life does not exhaust time, for the gods are not 
eternal and the cosmic creations and destructions succeed one another 
forever. 195 

Every novelty-inspired, exploration-driven “learning experience” has a revolutionary 
element; it is just that those reconstructions that involve stories with very limited “sizes” 
(that is, spatial-temporal areas) release only a proportionate amount of emotion. The 
“normal/ revolutionary” dichotomy is, therefore, not valid—it is always a matter of 
degree. Small-scale inconveniences require minor life-story modifications. Large-scale 
catastrophes, by contrast, undermine everything. The “biggest disasters” occur when the 
largest stories that we play out are threatened with dissolution, as a consequence of 
radical “environmental” transformation. Such transformation may occur in the natural 
course of things, when an earthquake or similar “act of God” takes place; may be 
generated internally, as a consequence of heretical action; or may emerge when the 
“foreign devils”—emissaries of chaos—threaten our explored territories (our nested 
stories, our cultural stability). In the latter case, we may well turn to war as an alternative 
deemed emotionally desirable. 

Our stories are nested (one thing leads to another) and hierarchically arranged [pursuit 
“a” is superordinate to pursuit “b” (love is more important than money)]. Within this 
nested hierarchy, our consciousness—our apperception—appears to have a “natural” 
level of resolution, or categorization. This default resolution is reflected in the fact, as 
alluded to previously, of the basic object level. We “see” some things naturally, that is, in 
Roger Brown’s terminology, at a level that gives us “maximal information with minimal 
cognitive effort.” 6 I don’t know what drives the mechanism that determines the 
appropriate level of analysis. Elements of probability and predictability must play a role. 
It is, after all, increasingly useless to speculate over increasingly large spatial-temporal 
areas, as the number of variables that must be considered increases rapidly, even 
exponentially (and the probability of accurate prediction, therefore, decreases). Perhaps 
the answer is something along the lines of “the simplest solution that does not generate 



Maps of meaning 88 


additional evident problems wins,” which I suppose is a variant of Occam’s razor. So the 
simplest cognitive/exploratory maneuver that renders an unpredictable occurrence 
conditionally predictable or familiar is most likely to be adopted. This is another example 
of proof through utility—if a solution “works” (serves to further progress toward a given 
goal), then it is “right.” Perhaps it is the frontal cortex that determines what might be the 
most parsimonious possible context, within which a given novel occurrence might be 
evaluated. So the notion would be that a novel occurrence initiates an exploratory 
procedure, part of which is devoted to determining the level of analysis most appropriate 
for conducting an evaluation. This would involve the shifting of stories. Also, a given 
stimulus is obviously not evaluated at all possible levels of analysis, simultaneously. This 
would constitute an impossible cognitive burden. It seems that the cortex must 
temporarily fixate at a chosen level, and then act “as if’ that is the only relevant level. 
Through this maneuver, the valence of something can appear similarly fixed. It is only 
this arbitrary restriction of data that makes understanding—and action—possible. 

Anyway: we are adapted, as biological organisms, to construe our environment as a 
domain with particular temporal and spatial borders—that is, as a place of a certain size, 
with a fixed duration. Within that “environment,” conceived of as that certain size and 
duration, certain phenomena “leap out at us,” and “cry out to be named.” 197 Whenever 
those “natural categories” of interpretation and their associated schemas of action fail us, 
however, we have to look up and down the scale of spatial-temporal resolution. We do 
this by looking at the big picture, when we have to, or by focusing on details that may 
have previously escaped us. Both the details and the big picture may be considered as 
dwindling or trailing off into, first, the unconscious (where they exist as potential objects 
of cognition) and then, the unknown (where they exist as latent information or as 
undiscovered facts). The unconscious may then be considered as the mediator between 
the unknown, which surrounds us constantly, and the domain that is so familiar to us that 
its contents have been rendered explicit. This mediator, I would suggest, is those 
metaphoric, imagistic processes, dependent upon limbic-motivated right-hemispheric 
activity, that help us initially formulate our stories. Figure 16: Nested Stories, Processes 
of Generation, and Multiple Memory Systems helps explain the idea of this 
“unconscious”—the broadest span stories, which are determined by complex social 
interactions, are episodic (imagistic) or even procedural (manifested only in socially 
modified behavior) in nature. There is a very narrow window of expressible “frames of 
reference”—conscious stories. Just ask any young child or unsophisticated adult to 
describe the “rationale” for their behaviors. 

Every level of analysis—that is, every definable categorization system and schema for 
action (every determinate story)—has been constructed, interpersonally, in the course of 
exploratory behavior and communication of the strategies and results thereof. Our natural 
levels of apprehension, the stories that most easily or by default occupy our attention, are 
relatively accessible to consciousness and amenable to explicit verbal/semantic 
formulation and

communication. The higher-level stories, which cover a broader expanse of spatial- 
temporal territory, are increasingly complex and, therefore, cannot be as simply 
formulated. Myth steps in to fill the breach. 


MYTHOLOGICAL REPRESENTATION: THE CONSTITUENT 
ELEMENTS OF EXPERIENCE 

Myth represents the world as forum for action. The world as forum for 
action comprises three eternally extant constituent elements of experience 
and a fourth that precedes them. The unknown, the knower, and the 
known make up the world as place of drama; the indeterminate 
“precosmogonic chaos” preceding their emergence serves as the ultimate 
source of all things (including the three constituent elements of 
experience). 

The precosmogonic chaos tends to take metaphorical form as 
the uroboros, the self-consuming serpent who represents the union 
of matter and spirit, and the possibility of transformation. The 
uroboros serves as “primal source” of the mythological world 
parents (the Great Mother, nature, deity of the unknown, creative 
and destructive; the Great Father, culture, deity of the familiar, 




Maps of meaning 90 


tyrannical and protective) and of their “Divine Son” (the Knower, the 
generative Word, the process of exploration). 

The ancient Mesopotamian creation myth—the Enuma elish — 
provides a concrete example of the interplay of these personalities. 
This myth features four main characters or sets of characters; 
Tiamat, the feminine dragon of chaos, primordial goddess of 
creation (the uroboros and the Great Mother are conflated, as is 
frequently the case, in this myth); Apsu, Tiamat’s husband and 
consort; the elder gods, children of Tiamat and Apsu; and Marduk, 
sun deity and mythic hero. Tiamat symbolizes the great unknown, 
the matrix of the world; Apsu the known, the pattern that makes 
regulated existence possible. The elder gods symbolize the 
common psychological attributes of humanity (the fragments or 
constituent elements of consciousness), and constitute a more 
thorough representation of the constituent elements of the 
patriarchal known; Marduk, greatest of the secondary deities, 
represents the process that eternally mediates between matrix and 
regulated existence. 

The original union of Tiamat and Apsu brings the elder gods into 
being. These gods carelessly kill Apsu, upon whom they 
unconsciously depend. Tiamat reappears, with a vengeance, and 
decides to destroy everything she has created. Her “children” send 
one volunteer after another out to overpower her. All fail. Finally, 
Marduk offers to do battle. He is elected as king—the greatest of 
gods, the “determiner of destinies”—and voluntarily confronts 
Tiamat. He cuts her apart, and creates the cosmos from her 
pieces. The Mesopotamian emperor, who ritually embodies 
Marduk, acts out this battle during the festival of the New Year, 
when the “old world” is renewed. 

The Enuma elish expresses in image and narrative the idea that 
the psychological function giving order to chaos (1) creates the 
cosmos and (2) should occupy a superordinate position, in the 
intrapsychic and social domains. The ideas contained in this myth 
are given more elaborated expression in later Egyptian works of 
metaphysical speculation, which more directly address the idea of 
the heroic renewal of culture. 

The three constituent elements of experience and the fourth who 
precedes them can be viewed, at a higher level of resolution, as 
seven universal characters (who may take on any of a variety of 
culture-specific identities). Myth describes the interactions of these 
characters. The great dragon of chaos—the uroboros, the self- 
devouring serpent—might be conceptualized as pure (latent) 
information, before it is parsed into the world of the familiar, the 
unfamiliar, and the experiencing subject. The uroboros is the stuff 
of which categorical knowledge is composed, before being that 
knowledge; it is the primary “element” of the world, which is 



Maps of Meaning 91 


decomposed into cosmos, surrounding chaos, and the exploratory 
process which “separates” the two. 

The bivalent Great Mother (second and third characters) is 
creation and destruction, simultaneously—the source of all new 
things, the benevolent bearer and lover of the hero; the destructive 
forces of the unknown, the source of fear itself, constantly 
conspiring to destroy life. The bivalent divine son (fourth and fifth) 
is the sun god, the hero who journeys to the underworld to rescue 
his incapacitated ancestors, the messianic son of the virgin mother, 
savior of the world—and, simultaneously, his sworn adversary, 
arrogant and deceitful. The bivalent Great Father (sixth and 
seventh) is the wise king and the tyrant, cultural protection from the 
terrible forces of nature, security for the weak, and wisdom for the 
foolish. Simultaneously, however, he is the force who devours his 
own offspring, who rules the kingdom with a cruel and unjust hand, 
and who actively suppresses any sign of dissent or difference. 

Terrible, chaotic forces lurk behind the facade of the normal 
world. These forces are kept at bay by maintenance of social order. 
The reign of order is insufficient, however, because order itself 
becomes overbearing and deadly, if allowed unregulated or 
permanent expression. The actions of the hero constitute an 
antidote to the deadly forces of chaos, and to the tyranny of order. 
The hero creates order from chaos and reconstructs that order 
when necessary. His actions simultaneously ensure that novelty 
remains tolerable and that security remains flexible.

Introduction 

Reasonable and informed observers—at least since the time of Frazier 199 —have 
established the widespread spatial and temporal dispersion of cosmogonic stories, tales of 
heroism and deceit, rituals of initiation, and standard imagistic representations, such as 
the virgin and child. These stories, tales, rituals and images often differ in detail, and 
temporal ordering; sometimes, however, they are simply the same. It is possible that this 
similarity might be the consequence of dissemination, from a single source, hundreds of 
centuries ago. This hypothesis, however, does not explain why standard stories are 
remembered, once disseminated, and transmitted down the generations, with little 



Maps of meaning 92 


structural alteration. It is reasonable to presume that, over the long run, our species 
“forgets” most things that are useless: we do not forget our myths, however. Indeed, 
much of the activity broadly deemed “cultural” is in fact the effort to ensure that such 
myths are constantly represented and communicated. 

Carl Jung attempted to account for the apparent universality of world interpretation 
with the hypothesis of the “collective unconscious.” Jung believed that religious or 
mythological symbols sprung from a universal source, whose final point of origin was 
biological (and heritable). His “collective unconscious” was composed of “complexes,” 
which he defined as heritable propensities for behavior or for classification. The Jungian 
position, which is almost never understood properly, has attracted more than its share of 
derision. Jung was not privy to our knowledge of the mechanisms of inheritance (a 
limitation necessarily shared by all members of his generation); the idea of “collective 
memories” appears impossible—Lamarckian—from the modern perspective. Jung did 
not really believe that individual memories themselves could be transmitted, however— 
although his writings, which are very difficult, do not always make this clear. When he 
speaks formally of the collective unconscious, he is at pains to point out that it is the 
possibility of categorization that is inherited, and not the contents of memory itself. 
However, he frequently writes as if the contents, as well, might be inherited. 

The general irritation over Jung’s “heritable memory” hypothesis has blinded 
psychologists and others to the remarkable fact that narratives do appear patterned, across 
diverse cultures. The fact that all cultures use what are clearly and rapidly identifiable as 
“narratives” (or at least as “rites,” which are clearly dramatic in nature) in itself strongly 
points to an underlying commonality of structure and purpose. It might still be objected: 
attempts to attribute comprehensible patterning to such narratives cannot be 
demonstrated, without a theory of interpretation, and that theory may be merely “reading 
in” patterns, where none actually “exist.” The same objection can, of course, be 
applied—and applied validly—to literary interpretation, the study of history, dream 
analysis and anthropology. Cultural phenomena cannot be understood except from a 
cultural perspective. This fundamental problem (among others) makes verification of 
theories in the “domain of value” difficult. 

Nonetheless, to live, it is necessary to act. Action presupposes belief and interpretation 
(implicit, if not explicit). Belief has to be grounded in faith, in the final analysis (as the 
criteria by which a moral theory might be evaluated have to be chosen, as well). There is 
no reason, however, why such faith cannot be informed, and critically assessed. It seems 
reasonable to presume that cross-cultural analysis of systems of belief, and their 
comparison with the essentially literary productions of the humanities, might constitute a 
means to attain such information. This was Jung’s approach. The “causal mechanism” he 
constructed to account for what he found—that is, the “collective unconscious”—appears 
insufficiently elaborated, from the modern empirical perspective (although the idea is 
much more complex, and much less easily dismissable, than generally conceded). This 
does not mean that we should dismiss Jung’s methodology or deride his otherwise 
valuable insights. Great modern minds, working in areas outside of psychology, have also 
concluded that stories have universal structures. 

How can the fact of patterned stories—archetypal stories, if you will—be reconciled 
with the apparent impossibility of inherited memory content? We might turn our attention 
to the phenomenon of language, and the processes of its “storage” and transmission, to 



Maps of Meaning 93 


find an answer. The human linguistic ability appears to have a relatively specific 
biological basis. Other animals do not have language, in their natural states, and cannot 
be taught language at any sophisticated level. Human children, by contrast—even when 
severely intellectually impaired—pick up language easily and use it fluently, naturally 
and creatively. Language use is an intrinsic characteristic of Homo sapiens, and the 
structure of language itself appears biologically grounded. Nonetheless, human languages 
differ. A native Japanese speaker cannot understand a native French speaker, although it 
might be evident to both that the other is using language. It is possible for two 
phenomena to be different at one level of analysis and similar at another. 

The question might be asked: upon what databank, so to speak, does a child draw, 
when he or she learns to talk (read, write)? The child listens to those around her. She is 
not explicitly “taught” how to talk, although some explicit teaching takes place. Her 
biological propensity encounters a cultural reality: the existence of language, in the 
culture. Her parents serve as primary intermediaries of culture: they embody language in 
their behavior and transmit it to her during their day-to-day activities. Nonetheless, they 
cannot be said to be the “creators” of language, although they may use it 
idiosyncratically—even creatively. It is the capability for human linguistic activity— 
whatever that is—that is the “creator.” The cumulative consequences of this capability, 
expressed over centuries, have modified the behavior of all the individuals who compose 
a given linguistic “culture.” Identifiable individuals serve as the temporary agents of 
embodied memory for the entire culture, at any given locale and time; nonetheless, the 
loss of a given individual poses no threat to the “knowledge” of the culture. This is 
because language is “remembered”—that is, embodied—in the behavior of all those who 
speak. Children pick up language by interacting with adults, who embody language. 
Thus, they learn to speak, and learn to know they have language, and even to observe and 
study the fact that they have language. 

The same holds true of moral behavior and of the belief that “underlies ” it. Adults 
embody the behavioral wisdom of their culture for their children. Children interact with 
adults, who serve as “cultural emissaries.” Obviously, a given adult may be a better or 
worse representative, just as a parent may be more or less literate. However, a bad 
example can be as exemplary as a good example; furthermore, children are rarely limited, 
in their exposure, to a single “hero.” If there are no other adults around in fact, they are 
inevitably present by proxy, in “entertainment”: in ritual, drama, literature and myth. The 
behavioral patterns that make up our stories might therefore be regarded as “stored” in 
our (social) behavior. This implies that such patterns may be abstracted from that 
behavior, at any time. The “collective unconscious” is, from this perspective, embodied 
behavioral wisdom, in its most fundamental form—is the cumulative transmitted 
consequences of the fact of exploration and culture on action. 

Our capacity for abstraction allows us to derive the constituent elements of successful 
“adaptation” itself from observation of behavioral patterns that are constantly played out 
in the world as it actually exists. The behavioral patterns that constitute adult interaction, 
for example, are exceedingly sophisticated and are conditioned to the last gesture by 
centuries of cultural work. We can extract “images” of these patterns; such images, just 
as sophisticated as the behaviors they represent, constitute the building blocks for our 
stories, and for our self-understanding. (The admirable adult, an identifiable individual, 
keeps her house tidy and neat, reconciles her warring brothers and learns hard moral 



Maps of meaning 94 


lessons when such learning is necessary. The archetypal hero makes order out of chaos, 
brings peace to the world, and restructures society when it has become rigid and 
anachronistic.) The “collective unconscious” that constitutes the basis for shared religious 
mythology is in fact the behavior, the procedures, that have been generated, transmitted, 
imitated, and modified by everyone who has ever lived, everywhere. Images of these 
behaviors and of the transcendent “place” where they occur (the universe of chaos and 
order) constitute metaphors, symbolic images. Metaphors mediate between our 
procedural wisdom and our explicit knowledge; they constitute the imagistic declarative 
point of transition between the act and the word. 

We have spent hundreds of thousands of years watching ourselves act and telling 
stories about how we act. A good story has a universal quality, which means that it 
speaks a language we all understand. Any universally comprehensible language must 
have universal referents, and this means that a good story must speak to us about those 
aspects of experience that we all share. But what is it that every human being shares, 
regardless of place and time of birth? Is it reasonable to posit that anything might remain 
constant, for example, across the centuries that separate us from our Stone Age ancestors; 
across the ideological and religious barriers that divide the inhabitants of our modern 
nations? Our distant predecessors lived much closer to nature, and the problems that beset 
them seem far removed from our current daily struggles. The great difference between us 
and them seems analagous in distance, if not precisely in kind, to that obtaining between 
the varied cultural worlds of today—to the great gap that still separates the Hindu 
religious mystic, for example, from the Manhattan investment banker. It is not surprising 
that a world characterized by such different human lives remains rife with constant 
intergroup conflict, nor is it surprising that we might seem to have outgrown our 
traditional wisdom. But are there fundamental presuppositions we might agree upon and 
share despite our differences? 

Most objects of experience have some properties in common, while varying with 
regard to others. Generally, the similarities and the differences are both significant. So it 
is with individuals, and with cultures. We seem peculiarly aware of our differences, 
however, and not of our similarities. Even groups of people who share much in common, 
at least from the perspective of more distant outsiders—the Irish Catholics and 
Protestants spring to mind—appear sufficiently conscious of those factors that make them 
unique in their social affiliation. I think this is in part because we are not built to focus on 
the predictable and familiar. Our attention gravitates naturally toward those aspects of our 
environments, natural and social, that contain information. The similarities of the Serb 
and the Croat are hidden from each other, so to speak, by a wall of habituation, but the 
differences stand out profoundly. 

To ask the question “What is it that two or more discriminable beings or things or 
situations might share?' is really to ask “At what levels of analysis might two or more 
things be considered the same? And at what levels different?” It is the particulars of our 
individuality—our specific time and place—that differentiate us from one another. What 
unites us is the fact of those particulars, however: the fact that we each have a specific 
time and place, and the implications of that fact for the nature of our existence. Our lives 
are open to possibility, but remain eternally bounded by disease, death and subjugation to 
social structure. As mutable, limited social beings, we are all engaged in a massive, 
cooperative and competitive endeavor. We do not understand the rules that govern this 



Maps of Meaning 95 


endeavor, in the final analysis; we cannot state explicitly why it is that we do what we do. 
Our democratic constitutions, for example—which contain the most fundamental axioms 
of the “body of law” that we imitate (that governs our behavior)—are inextricably 
embedded in the conception of natural rights (which is to say, in a statement of faith: 
“We hold these truths to be self-evident”). We are all, in consequence, imitating a story 
that we don’t understand. This story covers the broadest possible expanse of time and 
space (at least that expanse relevant to us), and is still implicitly “contained” in our 
behavior (although represented, in part, in episodic imagery and semantic description). 
This partially implicit containment constitutes our mythology, and our ritual, and 
provides the “upper-level,” “unconscious” frames of reference within which our 
conditional and expressible individual stories retain their validity. 

It is impossible to properly appreciate the nature of the categories of the mythological 
imagination without some understanding of the process of categorization. The act of 
categorization enables us to treat the mysterious and complex world we inhabit as if it 
were simpler—as if it were, in fact, comprehensible. We perform this act of 
simplification by treating objects or situations that share some aspect of structure, 
function or implication as if they were identical. People are very good at categorizing— 
so good, in fact, that the ability is taken for granted and appears simple. It is not so 
simple, however. Neither the “rules” that underly categorization, nor the act itself, have 
proved easy to describe. Roger Brown, the eminent psycholinguist, states: 

Until about 1973, psychological experiments on category formation 
conceived of human categories on the model of a “proper set.” Triangles 
are a proper set, which means that members of the triangle class are 
precisely definable in terms of a conjunction of attributes true of all 
members of the set, and of no nonmembers. A triangle is a closed three- 
sided figure. From the fact that a clear definition exists, it follows that 
membership in the set is not a matter of degree; one triangle is no more 
essentially triangular than any other. An entity either is or is not a triangle. 

In retrospect, it is amazing that psychology was for so long able to 
think of real-life categories as proper sets. We ought to have worred more 
over the extreme difficulty everyone has in defining anything “natural,” 
and natural, as used here, includes not only dogs and carrots but also 
artifacts like chairs, cars, and pencils. I know you can tell one when you 
see one, but just try listing the attributes that are true of all dogs and of no 
cats or wolves or hyenas, or of all the carrots and no radishes or turnips, or 
of all chairs and no small tables, hassocks, benches or slings. 200 

In the natural state, so to speak, human beings do not think like logicians or even like 
empiricists. It takes training to think like that. In the absence of such training, we still 
think, however; but more subjectively—like “unreasonable,” idiosyncratically emotional 
beings, who inhabit bodies of particular size, with particular and constrained properties. 
Our natural categories, which are the groupings we generate spontaneously, do not 
consist solely of the consensually apprehensible properties shared by the things and 
situations we encounter. Neither are natural categories tightly bounded; their borders are 
fuzzy, and they overlap. The construction of proper sets is possible—obviously, since 



Maps of meaning 96 


they exist—and the ability to construct and use such sets has proved useful, in a broad 
variety of manners. Nonetheless, the capability that underlies such construction appears 
relatively new, phylogenetically speaking, and seems dependent at least in part on the 
ability to think empirically and to regard things objectively. In the absence of such 
ability—which requires specialized training (or, at least, immersion in a culture like ours 
where such thinking has become commonplace) people naturally incline toward the 
development of what has been described (recently) as the “cognitive model.” Cognitive 
models are characterized by a number of distinctive properties (as paraphrased, in part, 
from George Lakoff" 01 ): 

1) They are embodied with regard to their content, which essentially means that they 
can be used, without necessarily being defined; are implicit in action, without necessarily 
being explicit in description. Two things classified within the same cognitive model are 
two things that evoke the same behavior, and can therefore be regarded, at least from the 
perspective of action, as one thing. If you are utilizing a cognitive model, and someone 
asks you to describe its content (“What makes a dog?”), you might say, “I can’t say, but I 
know when one is around.” You know that a dog is, for example, something friendly, 
something to be petted, and something to play with—although such knowledge does not 
constitute everything that makes up what you regard as dog. Most of the concepts you use 
are in fact embodied, at the most basic of levels—are habitual, procedural, motoric, 
behavioral. You can use them without thinking. Those that are not can only be applied 
slowly, with frill conscious attention, and with effort. 

2) They are characterized by basic-level categorization and basic-level primacy. These 
terms mean, respectively, that the phenomena most “naturally” apprehensible to the 
human mind—perceptible as a whole, or gestalt; nameable, communicable, manipulable, 
memorable—serve as the material for initial categorization, and that those initial 
categories provide the basis for the development of more abstract concepts (even for the 
comparison point for determining what we consider abstract). “Most naturally 
apprehensible” means learned and named first (generally with short names) and 
conceptualized at the level of distinctive action, (in association with such characteristic 
behaviors as petting for the category “cat” and smelling for the category “flower”). Our 
basic-level categories reflect our structure, as much as the structure of the external world: 
we most accurately conceive of those things that most simply present themselves to us. 
The “higher” and “lower” levels of category that surround these naturally apprehensible 
basic-level phenomena might be regarded, in contrast, as “achievements of the 
imagination,” to use Roger Brown’s phrase. 202 We perceive the “cat,” for example, and 
infer the species that contains the cat or the subtype that makes it Siamese. Our basic- 
level categories generally occupy the middle of our conceptual hierarchies: we generalize 
when we move “up,” and specialize when we move “down.” 

3) They may be used in metonymic or reference-point reasoning. Metonymic 
reasoning is symbolic, in the psychoanalytic or literary sense. Metonymic means 
interchangeable and more. The fact that objects in a cognitive model have metonymic 
properties means that any or all of those objects can stand for any or all of the others. 
This capacity makes sense, since all of the objects in a given category are by definition 
regarded as equivalent, in some nontrivial sense (most generally, in terms of implication 
for action). The human capacity for metaphor, aesthetic appreciation and allusion seems 



Maps of Meaning 97 


integrally related to the capacity for metonymic reasoning and the use of richly 
meaningful cognitive models. 

4) They are characterized by membership and centrality gradience. Membership 
gradience implies degree of membership, which is to say that an ostrich, for example, is a 
bird, blit perhaps not so much of a bird as a robin—because the robin has more properties 
that are central to the category bird. A thing can be a better or worse exemplar of its 
category; if it is worse, it can still be placed within that category. 

5) They contain phenomena associated as a consequence of familial resemblance, a 
term used first in this context by Ludwig Wittgenstein. -0 ' Things with familial 
resemblance all share similarities with a potentially hypothetical object. The prototypical 
Smith brother, to use a famous example, 204 may have a dark mustache, beady eyes, 
balding pate, thick hornrimmed glasses, dark beard, skinny neck, large ears and weak 
chin. Perhaps there are six Smith brothers, in total, none of whom has all the properties of 
the prototypical Smith. Morgan Smith has a weak chin, large ears, balding pate and 
skinny neck—but no glasses, mustache, or beard. Terry, by contrast, has the glasses, 
mustache and beard—but a hill head of hair, small ears and a normal neck. Nelson has a 
receding hairline, beady eyes, and a dark beard and mustache—and so on for Lance, 
Randy and Lyle. None of the brothers precisely resembles another, but if you saw them in 
a group, you would say, “those men are all related.” 

6) They give rise to the phenomenon of polysemy, a defining characteristic of myth. A 
polysemic story is written and can be read validly on many levels. The phenomenon of 
polysemy, discussed in some detail later in this book, arises when the relationship of 
objects within a particular cognitive model is analogous in some sense to the relationship 
that obtains between cognitive models. Great works of literature are always polysemic, in 
this manner: the characters within the story stand in the same relationship to one another 
as things of more general significance stand to one another, in the broader world. The 
struggle of Moses against the Egyptian pharaoh, for example, to take a story we will 
consider later, can also be read as an allegory of the struggle of the oppressed against the 
oppressor or, even more generally, as the rebellion of the [world-destroying (flooding)] 
savior against society. 

To say that two separable things belong to the same category is a tricky business. We 
presume, without thinking, that we group things as a consequence of something about 
them, rather than as a consequence of something about us. What do all chairs share in 
common, then? Any given chair may lack some of the most common chair attributes, 
such as legs, backs or armrests. Is a tree-stump a chair? Yes, if you can sit on it. It isn’t 
really something about an object, considered as an independent thing, that makes it a 
chair: it is, rather, something about its potential for interaction with us. The category 
“chair” contains objects that serve a function we value. Chairs may be efficiently sat 
upon—at least potentially. Our action in the face of an object constitutes an elementary 
but fundamental form of classification (constitutes, in fact, the most fundamental of all 
classifications; the classification from which all abstracted divisions are derived). The 
category of “all things that make you want to run away when you look at them” might be 
considered, for example, a very basic form of construct. Closely related to this category, 
although slightly higher in the hierarchy of abstraction, might be the category of “all 
objects to be feared,” or “all objects that are dangerous when approached in one fashion 
but beneficial when approached in another.” 



Maps of meaning 98 


It is a meaningful but “irrational” classification scheme of this sort that Jung described 
as a complex —one of the constituent elements of the “collective unconscious.” A 
complex is, in part, a group of phenomena, linked together because of shared significance 
[which is (essentially) implication for action, or emotional equivalence ]. Jung believed 
that many complexes had an archetypal (or universal) basis, rooted in biology, and that 
this rooting had something specifically to do with memory. It appears that the truth is 
somewhat more complicated. We classify things according to the way they appear, the 
way they act, and in accordance with their significance to us, which is an indication of 
how to act in their presence—and may mix any or all of these attributes, irrationally (but 
meaningfully), in a single scheme. We categorize diverse things in similar manners, 
across cultures, because we share perceptual apparatus, motivational drive and emotional 
state, as well as structure of memory and physical form, manifested in observable 
behavior. The imagination has its natural categories, dependent for their existence on the 
interaction between our embodied minds and the world of shared experience; into these 
categories fall particular phenomena in a more or less predictable manner. Stories 
describe the interactions of the contents of the categories of the imagination, which take 
embodied form, in the shape of dramatic characters. The characters have a predictable 
nature, and play out their relationships in an eternally fascinating patterned fashion, time 
and time again, everywhere in the world. 

So now we have the observation of commonality of structure, and a plausible theory to 
account for the presence of that commonality. Perhaps it would be reasonable, then, to 
describe the nature of the universal patterns in narrative—while placing a variety of 
additional and stringent constraints on that description, for the sake of caution (given the 
difficulty of verifying “interpretive theories”). First, let us make the description rationally 
acceptable, and internally consistent—that is, let us find a way of making sense of myth 
that does not conflict with the tenets of empiricism and experimental science, and that 
appears applicable to stories derived from many different places, and many different 
times. Let us further make the description simple, as a good theory should be simple—so 
that remembering the interpretive framework will be much easier than remembering the 
stories themselves. Let us make it compelling, as well, from the emotional perspective. 
Good theories have an affective component, sometimes described as “beauty.” This 
beauty appears simultaneously as efficiency—the same sort of efficiency that 
characterizes a well-crafted tool—and as what might be described as a “window into 
possibility.” A good theory lets you use things—things that once appeared useless—for 
desirable ends. In consequence, such a theory has a general sense of excitement and hope 
about it. A good theory about the structure of myth should let you see how a story you 
couldn’t even understand previously might shed new and useful light on the meaning of 
your life. Finally, let us constrain the description by making it fit with what is known 
about the manner in which the brain actually operates (and which was described 
previously); let us ensure that the world of myth, as interpreted, is the same world 
apperceived by the mind. 

Operation within this set of constraints allows for generation of the following 
straightfor-ward hypothesis: the “partially implicit” mythic stories or fantasies that guide 
our adaptation, in general, appear to describe or portray or embody three permanent 
constituent elements of human experience: the unknown, or unexplored territory; the 
known, or explored territory; and the process—the knower —that mediates between them. 



Maps of Meaning 99 


These three elements constitute the cosmos—that is, the world of experience—from the 
narrative or mythological perspective. 

No matter where an individual lives—and no matter when—he faces the same set of 
problems or, perhaps, the same set of metaproblems, since the details differ endlessly. He 
is a cultural creature, and must come to terms with the existence of that culture. He must 
master the domain of the known —explored territory—which is the set of interpretations 
and behavioral schemas he shares with his societal compatriots. He must understand his 
role within that culture—a role defined by the necessity of preservation, maintenance and 
transmission of tradition, as well as by capacity for revolution and radical update of that 
tradition, when such update becomes necessary. He must also be able to tolerate and even 
benefit from the existence of the transcendental unknown —unexplored territory—which 
is the aspect of experience that cannot be addressed with mere application of memorized 
and habitual procedures. Finally, he must adapt to the presence of himself—must face the 
endlessly tragic problem of the knower, the exploratory process, the limited, mortal 
subject; must serve as eternal mediator between the creative and destructive 
“underworld" of the unknown and the secure, oppressive patriarchal kingdom of human 
culture. 

We cannot see the unknown, because we are protected from it by everything familiar 
and unquestioned. We are in addition habituated to what is familiar and known —by 
definition—and are therefore often unable to apprehend its structure (often even unable to 
perceive that it is there). Finally, we remain ignorant of our own true nature, because of 
its intrinsic complexity, and because we act toward others and ourselves in a socialized 
manner, which is to say a predictable manner—and thereby shield ourselves from our 
own mystery. The figures of myth, however, embody the world—“visible" and 
“invisible.” Though the analysis of such figures, we can come to see just what meaning 
means, and how it reveals itself, in relationship to our actions. It is through such analysis 
that we can come to realize the potential breadth and depth of our own emotions, and the 
nature of our true being; to understand our capacity for great acts of evil—and great acts 
of good—and our motivations for participating in them. 

Consider once again this archaic creation myth from Sumer: 

So far, no cosmogonic text properly speaking has been discovered, but 
some allusions permit us to reconstruct the decisive moments of creation, 
as the Sumerians conceived it. The goddess Nammu (whose name is 
written with the pictograph representing the primordial sea) is presented 
as “the mother who gave birth to the Sky and the Earth” and the 
“ancestress who brought forth all the gods.” The theme of the primordial 
waters, imagined as a totality at once cosmic and divine, is quite frequent 
in archaic cosmogonies. In this case too, the watery mass is identified 
with the original Mother, who, by parthenogenesis, gave birth to the first 
couple, the Sky (An) and the Earth (Ki), incarnating the male and female 
principles. This first couple was united, to the point of merging, in the 
hieros gamos [mystical marriage]. From their union was born En-lil, the 
god of the atmosphere. Another fragment informs us that the latter 
separated his parents.... The cosmogonic theme of the separation of sky 
and earth is also widely disseminated. 205 



Maps of meaning 100 


The “sky” and “earth” of the Sumerians are categories of apprehension, characteristic of 
the Sumerian culture, and must not be confused with the sky and earth of modern 
empirical thinking. “An” and “Ki” are, instead, the dramatically represented Great Father 
and Great Mother of all things (including the son who “gives birth” to them). This 
somewhat paradoxical narrative is prototypical; mythologies of creation tend to manifest 
themselves in this pattern. In the Enuma elish, for example—the oldest written creation 
myth we possess—the Mesopotamian hero/deity Marduk faces the aquatic female dragon 
Tiamat (mother of all things, including Marduk himselt), cuts her up, and creates the 
world from her pieces. 206 The god Marduk serves explicitly as exemplar for the 
Mesopotamian emperor, 207 whose job is to ensure that the cosmos exist and remain 
stable, as a consequence of his proper “moral” behavior, defined by his imitation of 
Marduk. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, it is the Logos 206 —the word of God—that 
creates order from chaos, and it is in the image of the Logos that man [“Let us make man 
in our image, after our likeness” (Genesis 1:26)] is created. This idea has clear additional 
precedents in early and late Egyptian cosmology (as we shall see). In the Far East, 
similarly, the cosmos is imagined as composed of the interplay between yang and yin, 
chaos and order 209 —that is to say, unknown or unexplored territory and known or 
explored territory. Tao, from the Eastern perspective, is the pattern of behavior that 
mediates between them (analogous to En-lil, Marduk and the Logos) constantly 
generating, destroying, and regenerating the universe. For the Eastern individual, life in 
Tao is the highest good, the “way” and “meaning”; the goal toward which all other goals 
must remain subordinate. 

Our narratives describe the world as it possesses broad but classifiable implication for 
motor output—as it signifies. We gather information about the nature of the world, as it 
signifies for behavior, by watching ourselves and the others who compose our social 
groups act in the world. We derive conclusions about the fundamental meanings of things 
by observing how we respond to them. The unknown becomes classifiable, in this 
manner, because we respond to its manifestation predictably. It compels our actions, and 
“makes” us feel. It frightens us into paralysis and entices us forward, simultaneously; it 
ignites our curiosity, and heightens our senses. It offers us new information and greater 
well-being, at the potential cost of our lives. We observe our responses, which are 
biologically predetermined, and draw the appropriate conclusions. The unknown is 
intrinsically interesting, in a manner that poses an endless dilemma. It promises and 
threatens simultaneously. It appears as the hypothetical ultimate “source” of all 
determinate information, and as the ultimate unity of all currently discriminable things. It 
surrounds all things, eternally; engenders all things and takes all things back. It can 
therefore be said, paradoxically, that we know specific things about the domain of the 
unknown, that we understand something about it, can act toward and represent it, even 
though it has not yet been explored. This paradoxical ability is a nontrivial capacity. 
Since the unknown constitutes an ineradicable component of the “environment,” so to 
speak, we have to know what it is, what it signifies; we must understand its implication 
for behavior and its affective valence. 

Explored territory is something altogether different. Flabitual and familiar actions are 
useful there, instead of the frightened, tentative or exploratory behaviors that serve where 
nothing is certain. Flabits and familiar actions exist, as a general rule, because they have 
been successful, because their implementation suffices to transform what would 



Maps of Meaning 101 


otherwise be unexplored territory into a safe and fruitful haven. As we have been at pains 
to demonstrate, the unknown does not lose its a priori motivational significance— 
promise and threat—because of the passive process of “habituation.” Adaptation is 
active. “Habituation,” except in the most trivial of senses, is the consequence of 
successful creative exploration, which means generation of behavioral patterns that turn 
the indeterminate meaning of something newly encountered into something positive, at 
best—neutral, at worst. Is fire dangerous, or beneficial? It depends on how it is 
approached—which is to say, fire has context-dependent potential for harm and for 
benefit. Which of its many “potentials” fire actually manifests depends on what 
behavioral strategy is undertaken in its presence. Fire heats our homes. Now and then— 
when we are insufficiently cautious—it burns one of them down. What fire does—which 
is to say, what it is, from the perspective of motivational significance—depends on how 
we treat it. 

We have lost our fear of fire, not because we have habituated to it, but because we 
have learned how to control it. We have learned to specify and limit its “intrinsically” 
ambivalent affective valence, through modification of our own behavior, in its presence. 
Fire, insofar as we can control it, has been rendered predictable, non threatening—even 
familiar and comforting. All things we can control (which means, can bend to our own 
ends) have been likewise rendered predictable—by definition. The “territory” of 
“explored territory” is defined, at least in general, by security. Secure territory is that 
place where we know how to act. “Knowing how to act” means “being sure that our 
current actions will produce the results desired in the future.” The affective significance 
of the phenomena that comprise “explored territory” have been mapped. This map takes 
the form of the story, which describes the valence of present occurrences, the form of the 
desired future, and the means that might serve usefully to transform the former into the 
latter. Any territories our stories serve to render beneficial constitute “home ground.” 

Home ground—explored territory—is that place where unfamiliar things do not exist. 
Many of the things we encounter, however, are other people. This means that “explored 
territory” is also that place where unfamiliar behaviors are not encountered. On familiar 
ground, we engage in those activities that are habitual, alongside others, who are doing 
the same thing (who are pursuing the same goals, whose emotions can be understood, 
whose beliefs are the same as ours, whose actions are predictable). Much of what we 
know how to do is behavior matched to society—individual action matched to, adapted 
to, modified by, the cumulative behavior of the others who surround us. “Explored” 
necessarily means, therefore, “where human activity has been rendered predictable,” as 
well as “where the course of ‘natural’ events can be accurately determined.” The maps 
that make territory familiar consequently consist in large part of representations of 
behavior —personal behavior, which we manifest, and the behavior of others, which we 
constantly encounter, and to which we have adjusted our personal actions. So, we map 
our own behaviors and those of others, because such behaviors constitute a large part of 
the world. We do not always understand what we do, however—our actions cannot be 
said to be explicitly comprehended. Our behavioral patterns are exceedingly complex, 
and psychology is a young science. The scope of our behavioral wisdom exceeds the 
breadth of our explicit interpretation. We act, even instruct, and yet do not understand. 
How can we do what we cannot explain? 



Maps of meaning 102 


We have already seen that we can represent what we do not understand—that we 
derive knowledge about the nature of the unknown (about the fact that it is eternally 
frightening and promising), by watching how we behave in its presence. We do 
something similar with regard to the social world and the behaviors that compose it. We 
watch how others act—and imitate, and learn to act, in consequence. Furthermore, we 
learn to represent the social world—explored territory, in large part—by watching the 
actions that take place in it; by exploring the social world itself. These representations are 
first patterns of actions, then stories—once the nature of the behavioral patterns have 
been identified, and represented in a declarative manner. A good story portrays a 
behavioral pattern with a large “expanse” of valid territory. It follows, therefore, that the 
greatest of all stories portrays the pattern of behavior with the widest conceivable 
territory. 

We imitate and map adaptive behaviors—behaviors that efficiently reach a desired 
end—so that we can transform the mysterious unknown into the desirable and 
predictable; so that the social and nonsocial aspects of our experience remain under our 
control. The particular behaviors we imitate and represent, organized into a coherent unit, 
shared with others, constitute our cultures; constitute the manner in which we bring order 
to our existence. Our maps of adaptive behavior contain descriptions of the world in 
which that behavior is manifested—contains descriptions of explored and unexplored 
territory—as well as representations of the behaviors themselves. The stories mankind 
tells about the personal and historical past constitute expressions of the content of the 
declarative memory system, which is the system that knows what. Stories are generally 
told about animate objects, motivated, emotional beings, and might be regarded as 
descriptions of behavior, including antecedents, consequences and contexts. Stories 
contain portrayals of the outputs of the procedural system—which is the system that 
knows how—and inferences (explicit and implicit) about the existence and nature of 
factors (implicit, nonverbal, nondeclarative “presuppositions”), motivational and 
emotional, that guide and govern such output. The knowing what system therefore 
contains a complex sociohistorically constructed (but still somewhat “unconscious”) 
verbal and imaginative description of the actions of the knowing how system. This 
description takes narrative form. Capacity for such representation emerges as the 
consequence of a complex and lengthy process of development, originating in action, 
culminating in the production of capacity for abstract cognition. 

The episodic system, which generates representations of the experiential world, 
contains an elaborate model of the phenomenological world, composed in large part of 
encountered human behaviors generated by the other and the self, the most complex and 
affectively relevant phenomena in the human field of experience. This representation 
takes imaginative, dramatic, then narrative, mythic form as the model is constructed in 
fantasy, then described by the semantic system. Narrative/mythic “reality” is the world, 
conceived of in imagination, comprising imagistic representation of the behavioral 
pattern central to “morality,” played out in an environment permanently characterized by 
the interplay of the known and the unknown. This “reality” is the world as place of 
action, and not as “place of objective things.” 

All the world’s a stage, 

And all the men and women merely players: 



Maps of Meaning 103 


They have their exits and their entrances; 

And one man in his time plays many parts. 210 

Before the emergence of empirical methodology, which allowed for methodical 
separation of subject and object in description, the world-model contained abstracted 
inferences about the nature of existence, derived primarily from observations of human 
behavior. This means, in essence, that pre-experimental man observed “morality” in his 
behavior and inferred (through the process described previously) the existence of a source 
or rationale for that morality in the structure of the “universe” itself. Of course, this 
“universe” is the experiential field —affect, imagination and all—and not the “objective” 
world constructed by the post-empirical mind. This prescientific “model of reality” 
primarily consisted of narrative representations of behavioral patterns (and of the 
contexts that surround them), and was concerned primarily with the motivational 
significance of events and processes. As this model became more abstract—as the 
semantic system analyzed the information presented in narrative format, but not 
understood—man generated imaginative hypotheses about the nature of the ideal human 
behavior, in the archetypal environment. This archetypal environment was (is) composed 
of three domains, which easily become three “characters”: 

The unknown is unexplored territory, nature, the unconscious, dionysian force, the id, 
the Great Mother goddess, the queen, the matrix, the matriarch, the container, the object 
to be fertilized, the source of all things, the strange, the unconscious, the sensual, the 
foreigner, the place of return and rest, the maw of the earth, the belly of the beast, the 
dragon, the evil stepmother, the deep, the fecund, the pregnant, the valley, the cleft, the 
cave, hell, death and the grave, the moon (ruler of the night and the myterious dark), 
uncontrollable emotion, matter and the earth. 211 Any story that makes allusion to any of 
these phenomena instantly involves all of them. The grave and the cave, for example, 
connote the destructive aspect of the maternal—pain, grief and loss, deep water, and the 
dark woods; the fountain in the forest (water and woods in their alternative aspect), by 
contrast, brings to mind sanctuary, peace, rebirth and replenishment. 

The knower is the creative explorer, the ego, the I, the eye, the phallus, the plow, the 
subject, consciousness, the illuminated or enlightened one, the trickster, the fool, the 
hero, the coward; spirit (as opposed to matter, as opposed to dogma); the sun, son of the 
unknown and the known (son of the Great Mother and the Great Father). 212 The central 
character in a story must play the role of hero or deceiver; must represent the sun (or, 
alternatively, the adversary—the power that eternally opposes the “dominion of the 
light”). 

The known is explored territory, culture, Apollinian control, superego, the conscience, 
the rational, the king, the patriarch, the wise old man and the tyrant, the giant, the ogre, 
the cyclops, order and authority and the crushing weight of tradition, dogma, the day sky, 
the countryman, the island, the heights, the ancestral spirits and the activity of the 
dead. 2L ' Authority and its danger play central roles in interesting tales, because human 
society is hierarchical, and because the organized social world is omnipresent. Authority 
and power manifest themselves, implicitly or explicitly, in all human relationships; we 
have never lived—cannot live—without others. The fact of power relationships and 
authority constitutes an eternally challenging and necessary constant of the human 
domain of experience. 



Maps of meaning 104 


The unknown is yang, cold, dark and feminine; the known, yin, warm, bright and 
masculine; the knower is the man living in Tao, on the razor’s edge, on the straight and 
narrow path, on the proper road, in meaning, in the kingdom of heaven, on the 
mountaintop, crucified on the branches of the world-tree—is the individual who 
voluntarily carves out the space between nature and culture. The interpretation of words 
in relationship to these prototypes (unknown, knower, known) is complicated by the fact 
of shifting meaning: earth, for example, is unknown (feminine) in relationship to sky, but 
known (masculine) in relationship to water; dragon is feminine, masculine and subject 
simultaneously. This capacity for meanings to shift is not illogical, it is just not 
“proper.” 214 Meaning transforms itself endlessly with shift in interpretive context—is 
determined in part by that context (that frame of reference, that story). The same word in 
two sentences—one ironical, for example, the other straightforward—can have two 
entirely different, even opposite, meanings. Likewise, the sentence taken out of the 
context of the paragraph may be interpreted in some fashion entirely foreign to the intent 
of the author. Admission of the property of context-dependent meaning is neither 
illogical nor indicative of sloppy reasoning, nor primitive—it is merely recognition that 
context determines significance. The fact of context-dependence, however, makes 
interpretation of a given symbol difficult—particularly when it has been removed from its 
culturally constructed surroundings or milieu. 

The unknown, the known and the knower share tremendous affective bivalence: the 
domain of nature, the Great Mother, contains everything creative and destructive, because 
creation and destruction are integrally linked. The old must be destroyed to give way to 
the new; the mysterious source of all things (that is, the unknown) is also their final 
destination. Likewise, the domain of culture, the Great Father, is simultaneously and 
unceasingly tyranny and order, because security of person and property is always 
obtained at the cost of absolute freedom. The eternal subject, man, the knower, is equally 
at odds: the little god of earth is also mortal worm, courageous and craven, heroic and 
deceitful, possessed of great and dangerous potential, knowing good and evil. The 
unknown cannot be described, by definition. The known is too complicated to be 
understood. The knower—the conscious individual human being—likewise defies his 
own capacity for comprehension. The interplay between these ultimately unfathomable 
“forces” nonetheless constitutes the world in which we act, to which we must adapt. We 
have configured our behavior, accordingly; the natural categories 215 we use to apprehend 
the world reflect that configuration. 

The Tao existed before its name, 
and from its name, the opposites evolved, 
giving rise to three divisions, 
and then to names abundant. 

These things embrace receptively, 
achieving inner harmony, 
and by their unity create 
the inner world of man. 216 

The mythological world—which is the world as drama, story, forum for action—appears 
to be composed of three constituent elements and a “fourth” that precedes, follows and 



Maps of Meaning 105 


surrounds those three. These elements, in what is perhaps their most fundamental pattern 
of inter-relationship, are portrayed in Figure 17: The Constituent Elements of 
Experience. This figure might be conceptualized as three disks, stacked one on top of 
another, “resting” on an amorphous background. That background—chaos, the ultimate 
source and destination of all things—envelops the “world” and comprises everything that 
is now separate and identifiable: subject and object; past, present and future; “conscious” 
and “unconscious”; matter and spirit. The Great Mother and Father—the world parents 
(unexplored and explored territory, respectively; nature and culture)—can be usefully 
regarded as the primordial “offspring” of primeval chaos. The Great Mother—the 
unknown, as it manifests itself in experience—is the feminine deity who gives birth to 
and devours all. She is the unpredictable as it is encountered, and is therefore 
characterized, simultaneously, by extreme positive and extreme negative valence. The 
Great Father is order, placed against chaos; civilization erected against nature, with 
nature’s aid. Fie is the benevolent force that protects individuals from catastrophic 
encounter with what is not yet understood; is the walls that surrounded the maturing 
Buddha and that encapsulated the Flebrew Eden. Conversely, however, the Great Father 
is the tyrant who forbids the emergence (or even the hypothetical existence) of anything 
new. The Archetypal Son is the child of order and chaos—culture and nature—and is 
therefore clearly their product. Paradoxically, however, as the deity who separates the 
earth (mother) from the sky (father), he is also the process that gives rise to his parents. 
This paradoxical situation arises because the existence of defined order and the 
unexplored territory defined in opposition to that order can come into being only in the 
light of consciousness, which is the faculty that knows (and does not know). The 
Archetypal Son, like his parents, has a positive aspect and a negative aspect. The positive 
aspect continually reconstructs defined territory as a consequence of the “assimilation” of 
the unknown [as a consequence of “incestuous” (that is, “sexual”—read creative) union 
with the Great Mother]. The negative aspect rejects or destroys anything it does not or 
will not understand.

Figure 17: The Constituent Elements of Experience 

Figure 18: The Positive Constituent Elements of Experience, Personified 217 portrays 
the “Vierge Ouvrante,” a fifteenth century French sculpture, which represents the 
“constituent elements of the world” in personified, and solely positive form. 
Personification of this sort is the rule; categorical exclusion or inclusion in accordance 
with valence (all “bad” elements; all “good” elements) is almost equally common. All 
positive things are, after all, reasonably apprehended as similar, or identical—likewise, 
all negative things. It is for this reason, in part, that the terror of the unknown, the tyranny 
of the state, and the evil aspect of man are “contaminated” with one another—for this 
reason that the devil and the stranger are easily perceived as one. The “Vierge Ouvrante” 
is a strange work, from the standard Christian perspective, as it portrays Mary, the 
“mother of God,” as superordinate to God the Father and

Figure 18: The Positive Constituent Elements of 
Experience, Personified 

Christ the son. That superordinate position is perfectly valid, however, from the more 
general mythological perspective (although not exclusively valid). Each “constituent 
element of experience” can be regarded as progenitor, or as offspring, with regard to any 
other (as the world parents give birth to the divine son; as the divine son separates the 
world parents; as order is a derivative of chaos; as chaos is defined by order). So the most 
familiar Christian “sequence of generation” (which might be God Mary Christ) is only 
one of many “valid” configurations (and is not even the only one that characterizes 
Christianity). 

The world of experience is composed of the known—explored territory—in 
paradoxical juxtaposition with the unknown—unexplored territory. Archaic notions of 
“reality” presuppose that the familiar world is a sacred space, surrounded by chaos

(populated, variously, by demons, reptiles, spirits and barbarians—none of whom is 
really distinguishable). The world of order and chaos might be regarded as the stage, for 
man—for the twin aspects of man, more accurately: for the aspect that inquires, explores 
and transforms (which voluntarily expands the domain and structure of order, culture) 
and for the aspect that opposes that inquiry, exploration and transformation. The great 
story is, therefore, good vs. evil, played out against the endless flux of being, as it 
signifies. The forces of “good” have an eternal character (in the same way that Platonic 
objects are represented, eternally, in supracelestial space); unfortunately, so do the forces 
of evil. This eternality exists because all members of the species Homo sapiens are 
essentially equivalent, equal before God: we find ourselves vulnerable, mortal creatures, 
thrown into a universe bent on our creation and protection—and our transformation and 
destruction. Our “attitude” toward this ambivalent universe can only take one of two 
prototypical forms: positive or negative. The precise nature of these two forms (which 
can only be regarded as complex “personalities”) and of the background against which 
they work constitutes the central subject matter of myth (and, dare it be said, the proper 
subject matter of the humanities and fine arts). 

Analysis of a series of myths—the series which, I would argue, underlies Western 
civilization itself—should make these points painfully self-evident. We will begin with a 
discussion of the Enuma elish. This Mesopotamian creation story, which was elaborated 
in detail and complexity over the course of numerous centuries, is the most ancient 
complete cosmogonic myth at our disposal. We turn from the Sumerians to ancient 
Egyptian cosmology; then, from these specific examples to a more general discussion of 
mythological representation. 


The Enuma elish: A Comprehensive Exemplar of Narrative 
Categorization 

Creation myths are generally considered primitive or superstitious attempts to perform 
the magic of modern science. We assume that our ancestors were trying to do the same 
thing we do when we construct our cosmological theories and describe the generation of 
the objective world. This presumption is wrong. Our ancestors were not as simple- 
minded as we think they were, and their theories of the generation of the cosmos were not 
merely primitive science. Archaic theories of creation attempted to account for the 
existence of the world, as experienced in totality (which means, including meaning), and 
not for the isolated fact of the material world. The world as experienced in totality is 
made up of the material things we are familiar with, and the valences we consider 
epiphenomenal; of the objects of experience, and the fact of the subject, who does the 
experiencing. The world brought into being in archaic myths of creation is 
phenomenological, rather than material—it includes all aspects of experience, including 
those things we now regard as purely subjective. The archaic mind had not yet learned 
how to forget what was important. Ancient stories of the generation of the world 
therefore focus on all of reality, rather than on those distant and abstracted aspects we 
regard as purely objective. 

Science might be considered “description of the world with regard to those aspects 
that are consensually apprehensible” or “specification of the most effective mode of 
reaching an end (given a defined end).” Narrative—myth, most fundamentally—can be 



Maps of Meaning 109 


more accurately regarded as description of the world as it signifies (for action). The 
mythic universe is a place to act, not a place to perceive. Myth therefore describes things 
in terms of their unique or shared affective valence, their value, their motivational 
significance. If we can tell (or act out) a story about something, we can be said to have 
mapped that thing, at least in part. We tell stories about the unknown, and the knower, 
and the known, and can therefore be said, somewhat paradoxically, to have adapted to the 
unpredictable, to the fact that we can adapt to the unpredictable, and to explored territory 
itself, where everything has been rendered secure. Although the unknown is truly 
unknown, it can be regarded as possessed of stable characteristics, in a broad sense. 
These characteristics are revealed in the actions we undertake in response to the 
appearance of unexpected things. 

The world as experienced is composed of all the things we are familiar with and have 
classified in accordance with their relevance, and all the things we are unfamiliar with, 
which have a relevance all of their own, and of the process that mediates between the 
two, which turns the unfamiliar into the familiar and, sometimes, makes the predictable 
strange. The domain of the unfamiliar might be considered the ultimate source of all 
things, since we generate all of our determinate knowledge as a consequence of exploring 
what we do not understand. Equally, however, the process of exploration must be 
regarded as seminal, since nothing familiar can be generated from the unpredictable in 
the absence of exploratory action and conception. The domain of the known—created in 
the process of exploration—is the familiar world, firm ground, separated from the 
maternal sea of chaos. These three domains comprise the fundamental building blocks of 
the archaic world of myth. We briefly discussed an archaic Sumerian creation myth, 
previously, describing the “world” as the consequence of the separation of the cosmic 
parents, An (Sky) from Ki (Earth) by En-lil, their son and god of the atmosphere. The 
ancient Egyptians regarded the situation similarly: 

Like so many other traditions, the Egyptian cosmogony begins with the 
emergence of a mound in the primordial waters. The appearance of this 
“First Place” above the aquatic immensity signifies the emergence of the 
earth, but also the beginning of light, life, and consciousness. At 
Heliopolis, the place named the “Hill of Sand,” which formed part of the 
temple of the sun, was identified with the primordial hill. Hermopolis was 
famous for its lake, from which the cosmogonic lotus emerged. But other 
localities took advantage of the same privilege. Indeed, each city, each 
sanctuary, was considered to be a “center of the world,” the place where 
the Creation had begun. The initial mound sometimes became the cosmic 
mountain up which the pharaoh climbed to meet the sun god. 

Other versions tell of the primordial egg, which contained the “Bird of 
Light”..., or of the original lotus that bore the Child Sun, or, finally, of the 
primitive serpent, first and last image of the god Atum. (And in fact 
chapter 175 of the Book of the Dead prophesies that when the world 
returns to the state of chaos, Atum will become the new serpent. In Atum 
we may recognize the supreme and hidden God, whereas Re, the Sun, is 
above all the manifest God....) The stages of creation—cosmogony, 
theogony, creation of living beings, etc.—are variously presented. 



Maps of meaning 110 


According to the solar theology of Heliopolis, a city situated at the apex 
of the Delta, the god Re-Atum-Khepri [three forms of the sun, noontime, 
setting, and rising, respectively] created a first divine couple, Shu (the 
Atmosphere) and Tefiiut, who became parents of the god Geb (the Earth) 
and of the goddess Nut (the Sky). The demiurge performed the act of 
creation by masturbating himself or by spitting. The expressions are 
naively coarse, but their meaning is clear: the divinities are born from the 
very substance of the supreme god. Just as in the Sumerian tradition, Sky 
and Earth were united in an uninterrupted hieros gamos until the moment 
when they were separated by Shu, the god of the atmosphere [in other 
similar traditions, Ptah]. From their union were born Osiris and Isis, Seth 
and Nephthys [who will be discussed later]. 218 

Primordial myths of creation tend to portray the origin of things as the consequence of at 
least one of two related events. The universe was symbolically born into being, for 
example, as a result of the action of a primeval hermaphroditic deity. Alternatively, it 
arose from the interaction of somewhat more differentiated masculine and feminine 
spirits or principles (often the offspring of the most primordial god)—emerged, for 
example, from the interplay of the sky, associated (most frequently) with the father, and 
the earth (generally but not invariably granted a female character). Imagery of the latter 
sort remains latently embedded in the oldest (Jahwist) creation myth in the familiar Old 
Testament book of Genesis. The Jahwist story begins in the fourth stanza of the second 
chapter of Genesis and describes the masculine God breathing life (spirit) into the 
adamah, mother earth, thereby creating the original (hermaphroditic) man, Adam." 19 In 
alternative, more actively dramatic accounts—such as that of the Enuma elish, the 
Babylonian creation myth—the creative demiurge slays a dragon, or a serpent, and 
constructs the universe out of the body parts. The two forms of story, very different on 
the surface, share deep grammatical structure, so to speak; utilize metaphors that are 
closely associated, psychologically and historically, to drive their fundamental message 
home: 


In the Babylonian creation hymn Enuma elish [(“when above” 220 ), circa 
650 B.C., in its only extant form; derived from a tradition at least two 
thousand years older] the god of the fresh-water sea, Apsu, was killed and 
his widow Tiamat, goddess of the “bitter” or salt waters, threatened the 
gods with destruction. Marduk, the champion of the gods, killed her and 
split her in two, creating heaven out of one half and earth out of the other. 
Similarly, the creation in Genesis begins with a “firmament” separating 
the waters above from the waters below, but succeeding a world that was 
waste (tohu) and void, with darkness on the face of the deep (tehom). The 
Hebrew words are said to be etymologically cognate with Tiamat, and 
there are many other allusions in the Old Testament to the creation as a 
killing of a dragon or monster. 221 


It is easy, or, at least appears easy, to understand why the pre-experimental mind might 
frequently have associated the creation of everything with femininity—with the source of 



Maps of Meaning 111 


new life through birth (most evidently, the cause and concrete origin of all living things). 
The role of the male in the original creation—the part played by the “masculine 
principle,” more precisely—is comparatively difficult to comprehend, just as the male 
role in procreation is less obvious. Nonetheless, the most widely disseminated of creation 
myths—and, arguably, the most potent and influential—essentially reverses the standard 
pattern of mythic origin, and places particular emphasis on the masculine element. In the 
Judeo-Christian tradition, creation depends on the existence and action of Logos, 
mythically masculine discriminant consciousness or exploratory spirit, associated 
inextricably with linguistic ability—with the Word, as St. John states (in what was 
perhaps designed to form the opening statement of the New Testament, structurally 
paralleled with the beginning of Genesis""): 

In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the 
Word was God. 

The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by 
him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. 

In him was life; and the life was the light of men. And the light shineth 
in darkness; and the darkness comprehended it not. (John 1:1-4) 

The explicit stress placed by the Judeo-Christian tradition on the primacy of the word and 
its metaphorical equivalents makes it somewhat unique in the pantheon of creation 
myths. The early Jews were perhaps the first to clearly posit that activity in the 
mythically masculine domain of spirit was linked in some integral manner to the 
construction and establishment of experience as such. It is impossible to understand why 
the Judeo-Christian tradition has had such immense power—or to comprehend the nature 
of the relationship between the psyche and the world—without analyzing the network of 
meaning that makes up the doctrine of the Word. 

There exists clear psychological precedent for the philosophy of the early Jews (and 
the later Christians) in the Mesopotamian and Egyptian schools of metaphysical 
speculation—in their rituals, images and acts of abstract verbal representation. The 
Mesopotamian creation myth, which we will consider first—the Enuma elisk —portrays 
the emergence of the earliest world as the consequence of the (sexual, generative, 
creative) union of the primal deities Apsu and Tiamat. Apsu, masculine, served as the 
begetter of heaven and earth, prior to their identification as such (before they were 
named). Tiamat, “she who gave birth to them all,” 223 was his consort. Initially, Apsu and 
Tiamat existed (?) indistinguishably from one another, “still mingled their waters 
together” 224 when “no pasture land had been formed, and not even a reed marsh was to be 
seen; when none of the other gods had been brought into being, when they had not yet 
been called by their name, and their destinies had not yet been fixed.” 225 Their uroboric 
union served as the source from which more differentiated but still fundamental 
structures and processes or spirits issued: “at that time, were the gods created

with them.” 226 The “precosmogonic egg” “inhabited” by Tiamat and Apsu gave rise to 
the initial “world of gods.” This process is portrayed schematically in Figure 19: The 
Birth of the World of Gods. 

The Mesopotamian gods—like deities everywhere—present somewhat of a mystery to 
the modern mind. Archaic cultures are rife with deities. We seem unable to locate them 
now. They do not seem part of the objective external world. It is tempting, therefore, to 
regard such beings as imaginative constructions, as personifications of subjective 
affective or emotional states or drives, the incarnated form of subjective experience. The 
term “personification,” however, implies a voluntary act—connotes the conscious use of 
metaphor, on the part of the individual driven to represent and knowing that he is 
representing. There is no indication, however, that it is an act of conscious creation that 
gives rise to the pre-experimental deity; in fact, the opposite appears more true: it is the 
“action of the deity” that gives rise to creative endeavor, as such, on the part of the 
creating subject. The god must therefore be more than the subject; more than the 
subject’s original narrative conception of himself. 

The phenomena that we would now describe as emotions or motive forces, from the 
per-spective of our modern, comparatively differentiated and acute self-consciousness, do 
not appear to have been experienced precisely as “internal” in their original form. Rather, 
they made their appearance as part and parcel of the experience (the event, or sequence of 
events) that gave rise to them, and adopted initial representational form in imaginative 







Maps of Meaning 113 


embodiment. The modem idea of the “stimulus” might be regarded as a vestigial remnant 
of this form of thinking—a form that grants the power of affective and behavioral control 
to the object (or which cannot distinguish between that which elicits a response, and the 
response itself). We no longer think “animistically” as adults, except in our weaker or 
more playful moments, because we attribute motivation and emotion to our own agency, 
and not (generally) to the stimulus that gives proximal rise to them. We can separate the 
thing from the implication of the thing, because we are students and beneficiaries of 
empirical thinking and experimental method. We can remove attribution of motive and 
affective power from the “object,” and leave it standing in its purely sensory and 
consensual aspect; can distinguish between what is ns and what is world. The pre- 
experimental mind could not (cannot) do this, at least not consistently; could not reliably 
discriminate between the object and its ejfect on behavior. It is that object and effect 
which, in totality, constitute a god (more accurately, it is a class of objects and their 
effects that constitute a god). 

A god, so considered—more specifically, a potent and powerful god, one with a 
history—constitutes the manner in which a group or family of stimuli of isomorphic 
motivational significance reveals itself to or grips the collective (communicated) 
imagination of a given culture. Such a representation is a peculiar mix (from the later, 
empirical viewpoint) of psychological and sociological phenomena and objective 
“fact”—an undifferentiated mix of subject and object (of emotion and sensory 
experience), transpersonal in nature (as it is historically elaborated “construction” and 
shared imaginative experience). The primitive deity nonetheless serves as accurate 
representation of the ground of being, however, because it is affect and subjectivity as 
well as pure object (before the two are properly distilled or separated)—because it is 
primordial experience, rather than the mere primordial thing. 

The original “children of Tiamat and Apsu”—the “elder gods”—should therefore be 
regarded as embodiments of the archaic transpersonal intrapsychic phenomena that give 
rise to human motivation, as well as those aspects of the objective world that activate 
those intrapsychic systems. The Sumerians considered themselves destined to “clothe and 
feed” such gods, because they viewed themselves as the servants, in a sense, of what we 
would call instinctive forces, “elicited” by the “environment.” Such forces can be 
reasonably regarded as the Sumerians regarded them—as deities inhabiting a 
“supracelestial place,” extant prior to the dawn of humanity. Erotic attraction, for 
example—a powerful god—has a developmental history that predates the emergence of 
humanity, is associated with relatively “innate” releasing “stimuli” (those that 
characterize erotic beauty), is of terrible power, and has an existence “transcending” that 
of any individual who is currently “possessed.” Pan, the Greek god of nature, 
produced/represented fear (produced “panic”); Ares or the Roman Mars, warlike fury and 
aggression. We no longer personify such “instincts,” except for the purposes of literary 
embellishment, so we don’t think of them “existing” in a “place” (like heaven, for 
example). But the idea that such instincts inhabit a space—and that wars occur in that 
space—is a metaphor of exceeding power and explanatory utility. Transpersonal motive 
forces do wage war with one another over vast spans of time; are each forced to come to 
terms with their powerful “opponents” in the intrapsychic hierarchy. The battles between 
the different “ways of life” (or different philosophies) that eternally characterize human 
societies can usefully be visualized as combat undertaken by different standards of value 



Maps of meaning 114 


(and, therefore, by different hierarchies of motivation). The “forces” involved in such 
wars do not die, as they are “immortal”: the human beings acting as “pawns of the gods” 
during such times are not so fortunate. 

Back to the Enuma elish : The secondary/patriarchal deities of the Mesopotamian 
celestial pantheon—including the couples Lahmu and Lahamu and Kishar and Anshar -— 
arose as a direct consequence of the interactions of the original sexualized “unity” of 
Tiamat and Apsu, the most primal of couples. This undifferentiated precosmogonic egg 
(a common metaphor in other creation myths) “contains” an alloy of “order” (the 
“masculine” principle”) and “chaos” (the “feminine” principle). This alloy is the “world 
parents,” locked in “creative embrace” (is spirit and matter, conceived alternatively, still 
“one thing”). Tiamat and Apsu’s union gives rise to children—the primordial instincts or 
forces of life who, in turn, engender more individualized beings. The Enuma elish itself 
does not spend much time fleshing out the specific characteristics of these forces of life, 
as it is concerned with more general issues. Lahmu and Lahamu and Kishar and Anshar 
are incidental characters, serving only as intermediaries between the real protagonists of 
the drama—Marduk, a late-born individual-like god, and Tiamat, his turncoat mother. 
Kishar and Anshar therefore serve only as progenitors of Ann, who in turn “begot Ea ,“ 7 
his likeness,” “the master of his fathers,” 228 “broad of understanding, wise, mighty in 
strength, much stronger than his grandfather, Anshar,” 229 without “rival among the gods 
his brothers.” 230 

The elder gods serve merely to reproduce and to noisily act. Their incessant racket and 
movement upsets the divine parents; disturbs “the inner parts of Tiamat.” 231 So Tiamat 
and Apsu conspire to “devour” their children. This is a common mythological 
occurrence; one echoed later in the story of Yahweh, Noah and the Flood. The gods give 
birth to the cosmos, but ceaselessly attempt to destroy it. 

Ea catches wind of his parents’ plot, however, however, and slays Apsu—adding 
insult to injury by building a house on his remains (and by naming that house Apsu, in 
mockery or remembrance). Into this house he brings his bride, Damkina, who soon gives 
birth to Marduk, the hero of the story, “the wisest of the wise, the wisest of the gods,” 232 
filled with “awe-inspiring majesty.” 2 ’ ’ When Ea saw his son: 

He rejoiced, he beamed, his heart was filled with joy. 

He distinguished him and conferred upon him double equality with the 

gods, 

So that he was highly exalted and surpassed them in everything. 

Artfully arranged beyond comprehension were his members, 

Not fit for human understanding, hard to look upon. 

Four were his eyes, four were his ears. 

When his lips moved, fire blazed forth. 

Each of his four ears grew large, 

And likewise his eyes, to see everything. 

He was exalted among the gods, surpassing was his form; 

His members were gigantic, he was surpassing in height. 

Mariyutu, Mariyutu: 

Son of the sun-god, the sun-god of the gods! 234 



Maps of Meaning 115 


Marduk is characterized by the metaphoric associates of consciousness. He has 
exaggerated sensory capacities; his very words are characterized by creative and 
destructive power (by the transformative capacity of fire). He is the “sun-god,” above all, 
which means that he is assimilated to (or, more accurately, occupies the same 
“categorical space”) as “sight,” “vision,” “illumination,” “enlightenment,” “dawn,” the 
“elimination of darkness” and the “death of the night.” 

In the midst of all this action—war plans, death, birth —-Anu (Marduk’s grandfather, 
Ea’s father) busies himself with the generation of the four winds. His work raises waves 
upon the surface of the waters occupied by Tiamat, and the (previously unidentified) 
primary/matriarchal subdeities that (apparently) accompany her there. This new intrusion 
troubles her beyond tolerance, upset as she was already at the noise of her offspring and 
death of her husband. She decides to rid the universe of the (secondary/patriarchal) elder 
gods, once and for all, and begins to produce horrible “soldiers” to aid her in battle: 

.. .bearing monster serpents 

Sharp of tooth and not sparing the fang. 

With poison instead of blood she filled their bodies. 

Ferocious dragons she clothed with terror, 

She crowned them with fear-inspiring glory and made them like gods, 

So that he who would look upon them should perish from terror. 2 ' 5 

The angry Tiamat—the unknown, chaos, in its terrible or destructive aspect—produces 
eleven species of monsters to aid her in her battle, including the viper, the dragon, the 
great lion, the rabid dog, the scorpion-man and the storm-demon. She elects the firstborn, 
Kingu by name, to reign over them all, giving him “the tablet of destinies” 236 to signify 
his ascension and dominion. The story continues: 

After Tiamat had made strong preparations, 

She made ready to join battle with the gods her offspring. 

To avenge Apsu, Tiamat did this evil. 

How she got ready for the attack was revealed to Ea. 

When Ea heard of this matter, 

He became benumbed with fear and sat in silent gloom.

After he had reflected on the matter and his wrath had subsided, 

He went to Anshar, his |great-Igrandfather. 

And when he had come into the presence of Anshar, his [great¬ 
grandfather. 

He communicated to him all that Tiamat had planned. 237 

Now, although Apsu isn’t well described in the Enuma elish, it is clear that he is the 
masculine consort of Tiamat. The “masculine” consort of the “goddess of the unknown” 
is inevitably the “god of the known” (or his “progenitor” and dependent, the knower). It 
is the “known” that serves as protection from the unknown, whether this is understood or 
not. Ea kills Apsu, which means that he unconsciously strips himself of protection. 

Ea might therefore be reasonably regarded as representative of that part of humanity 
eternally (and ignorantly) contemptuous of tradition and willing to undermine or destroy 
the past without understanding its necessity or nature. Those “unconsciously” protected 
from the outside world by the walls of culture may become irritated by the limitations 
such walls represent, and incautiously pull them down. This act of destruction, disguised 
as a blow for freedom, lets the terrible unknown flood back in. The Great Mother is a 
terrible force, in the absence of patriarchal protection. The Enuma elish makes this vital

point, implicitly. This state of affairs is represented schematically in Figure 20: The 
“Death” of Apsu, and the (Re)Emergence ofTiamatas Threat. 

Anshar is terribly upset by the news of Tiamat’s anger. He asks Ea to stand against 
Tiamat. Ea fails, deservedly, and Anshar sends Anu in his stead. He is routed as well, and 
returns, overcome by terror. In desperation and final hope, Anshar and Ea call on 
Marduk, the young sun-god: 

Ea called Marduk to his private room; 

He advised him, telling him the plan of his heart: 

“Marduk, consider my idea, hearken to thy father. 

Thou art he, my son, who relieves his heart; 

Draw nigh into the presence of Anshar, ready for battle; 

Speak and stand forth; when he sees thee, he will be at rest.” 

[Marduk] was glad at the word of his father; 

He drew nigh and stood before Anshar. 

When Anshar saw him, his heart was filled with joy; 

He kissed his lips, his fear was removed. 

“Anshar, be not silent, but open thy lips; 

I will go and accomplish all that is in thy heart! 

What man is it who has brought battle against thee? 

Tiamat, who is a woman, is coming against thee with arms! 

My father, creator, be glad and rejoice; 

Soon thou shalt trample upon the neck of Tiamat! 

Yea, my father, creator, be glad and rejoice; 

Soon thou shalt trample upon the neck of Tiamat!” 

Anshar answers: 

“My son, who knowest all wisdom, 

Quiet Tiamat with thy holy incantation.” 238 

Marduk’s “magic words” (remember, he speaks fire) are clearly and reasonably portrayed 
as one of the most powerful weapons in the battle against the forces of chaos. Anshar 
continues: 

“On the storm chariot quickly pursue the way! 

[...].. .turn her back!” 

The lord was glad at the word of his father; 

His heart exulted, and he said to his father: 

“Lord of the gods, destiny of the great gods, 

If I am indeed to be your avenger, 

To vanquish Tiamat and to keep you alive, 

Convene the assembly and proclaim my lot supreme [emphasis added]. 

When ye are joyfully seated together in the Court of Assembly, 

May I through the utterance of my mouth determine the destinies, instead 
of you.

Alexander Heidel, who provided the translation of the Enuma elish cited here, comments: 

Marduk demands supreme and undisputed authority as the price for 
risking his life in combat with Tiamat. When therefore the gods, at the 
New Year’s festival [see discussion below], convened in the Court of 
Assembly, “they reverently waited” on Marduk, the “king of the gods of 
heaven and earth,” and in that spirit they decided the destinies. The gods, 
indeed, “continue to determine destinies long after Marduk has received 
the powers he here desires”; 240 but the final decision rested with Marduk, 
so that in the last analysis it was he who decided the fates. 241 

This is an example of the “hierarchical organization of the gods,” a concept frequently 
encapsulated in mythology, and one we shall return to later. All the original children of 
Tiamat are potent and impersonal elder gods, “psychological forces”—the “deities” that 
eternally rule or constitute human motivation and affect. The question of the proper 
ordering of those forces (“ who, or what, should rule?”) is the central problem of morality, 
and the primary problem facing human individuals and social organizations. The 
Sumerian “solution” to this problem was the elevation of Marduk—the sun-god who 
voluntarily faces chaos—to the position of “king” (and the subjugation of the other gods 
to that “king”): 

Anshar opened his mouth 

And addressed these words to Kaka, his vizier: 

“Kaka, my vizier, who gladdenest my heart, 

Unto Lahmu and Lahamu I will send thee; 

Thou knowest how to discern and art able to relate. 

Cause the gods my fathers to be brought before me. 

Let them bring all the gods to me! 

Let them converse and sit down to banquet. 

Let them eat bread and prepare wine. 

For Marduk, their avenger, let them decree the destiny. 

Set out, O Kaka, go, and stand thou before them. 

What I am about to tell thee repeat unto them. 

Anshar, your son, has sent me. 

The command of his heart he has charged me to convey, 

Saying: Tiamat, our bearer, hates us. 

She held a meeting and raged furiously. 

All the gods went over to her; 

Even those who ye have created march at her side. 

They separated themselves and went over to the side of Tiamat; 

They were angry, they plotted, not resting day or night; 

They took up the fight, filming and raging; 

They held a meeting and planned the conflict.

Mother Hubur [Tiamat], who fashions all things, 

Added thereto irresistible weapons, bearing monster serpents 
Sharp of tooth and not sparing the fang. 

With poison instead of blood she tilled their bodies. 

Ferocious dragons she clothed with terror, 

She crowned them with fear-inspiring glory and made them like gods. 

So that they might cause him who would look upon them to perish from 
terror, 

So that their bodies might leap forward and none turn back their breasts. 
She set up the viper, the dragon, and the lahumum 
The great lion, the mad dog, and the scorpion-man, 

Driving storm demons, the dragonfly, and the bison, 

Bearing unsparing weapons, unafraid of battle. 

Powerful are her decrees, irresistible are they. 

Altogether eleven kinds of monsters of this sort she brought into being. 

Of those among the gods, her first-born, who formed her assembly, 

She exalted Kingu; in their midst she made him great. 

To march at the head of the army, to direct the forces, 

To raise the weapons for the engagement, to launch the attack, 

The high command of the battle, 

She intrusted to his hand; she caused him to sit in the assembly, saying: 

I have cast the spell for thee, I have made thee great in the assembly of the 
gods. 

The dominion over all the gods I have given into thy hand. 

Mayest thou be highly exalted, thou my unique spouse! 

May thy names become greater than those of the Anunnaki! 

She gave him the tablet of destinies, she fastened it upon his breast, saying 
“As for thee, thy command shall not be changed, the word of thy mouth 
shall be dependable!” 

Now when Kingu had been exalted and had received supreme dominion, 
They decreed the destinies of the gods, her sons, saying: 

“May the opening of our mouths quiet the fire-god! 

May thy overpowering poison vanquish the opposing night!” 

I sent Anu, but he could not face her. 

Ea also was afraid and turned back. 

Then Marduk, the wisest of the gods, your son, came forward.

His heart prompted him to face Tiamat. 

He opened his mouth and said to me: 

“If I am indeed to be your avenger, 

To vanquish Tiamat and to keep you alive, 

Convene the assembly and proclaim my lot supreme. 

When ye are joyfully seated together in the Court of Assembly, 

May I through the utterance of my mouth determine the destinies, instead 
of you. 

Whatever I create shall remain unaltered, 

The command of my lips shall not return void, it shall not be changed.”

The “hierarchical organization of the gods” is represented schematically in Figure 21: 
“World” of Gods: Hierarchical Organization, which portrays Marduk as the 
superordinate personality or pattern of action, “designed” to transform the unbearable 
present into the desired future. The Enuma elish states, essentially: “When things are 
normal, any god might rule. However, in the case of a true crisis, everyone turns to the 
sun-god (the embodiment of “consciousness”). Perhaps it is reasonable to presume.

therefore, that he should always reign supreme.” The “formulation” of this “hypothesis” 
was a work of unsurpassed genius, and a decisive move in the history of the Western 
mind. 

The vizier Kaka goes on his way, as commanded, and spreads the word among the 
(secondary/patriarchal) elder deities, who assemble to contemplate the upcoming battle: 

They entered into the presence of Anshar and tilled the Court of 
Assembly; 

They kissed one another as they came together in the assembly; 

They conversed and sat down to a banquet. 

They ate bread and prepared wine. 

The sweet wine dispelled their fears; 

Their bodies swelled as they drank the strong drink. 

Exceedingly carefree were they, their spirit was exalted; 

For Marduk, their avenger, they decreed the destiny. 

They erected for him a lordly throne-dais, 

And he took his place before his fathers to receive sovereignty. 

“Thou art the most important among the great gods, 

Thy destiny is unequaled, thy command is like that of Anu. 

Marduk, thou art the most important among the great gods. 

Thy destiny is unequaled, thy command is like that of Anu. 

From this day onward thy command shall not be changed. 

To exalt and abase—this shall be thy power! 

Dependable shall be the utterance of thy mouth, thy command shall not 
prove vain. 

None among the gods shall infringe upon thy prerogative.” 243 

The gods place “the starry garment of the night sky” 244 in their midst. At the command of 
Marduk’s mouth—on his word—it appears; at his command, it disappears, “as the night 
sky on the passage of the sun.” 245 Marduk is clearly part of the pantheon who eternally 
vanquish the dragon of the night. The story continues: 

When the gods his fathers beheld the power of his word, 

They were glad and did homage, saying: “Marduk is king!” 

They bestowed upon him the scepter, the throne, and the royal robe; 

They gave him an irresistible weapon smiting the enemy, saying: 

“Go and cut off the life of Tiamat. 

May the winds carry her blood to out-of-the-way places.” 

After the gods his fathers had determined the destiny of [Marduk], 

They set him on the road—the way to success and attainment. 246 

Marduk gathers his armaments—bow, club and lightning—sets himself ablaze, and 
fashions a net to enclose Tiamat. Fie is a master of fire and armaments—which is to say, 
a master of the technology that serves most fundamentally to transform the unknown and 
terrifying world into the comforting, productive and familiar. Fie is able to bind the 
unknown; to limit its sphere of action, and to bring it under control. Fie raises the winds,

and the storm to aid him, using the forces of nature against nature itself. He dresses 
himself in a terrifying coat of mail, and wears “terror-inspiring splendor” on his head. 
Prepared carefully in this manner, and fortified against poison, he takes the “direct route” 
to Tiamat. He confronts (re-emergent) novelty voluntarily, at a time of his choosing, after 
careful preparation, and without avoidance. His mere appearance strikes terror into the 
heart of Kingu and his legion of monsters (just as Christ, much later, terrifies the Devil 
and his minions). Marduk confronts Tiamat, accuses her of treachery, and challenges her 
to battle. 

When Tiamat heard this. 

She became like one in a frenzy and lost her reason. 

Tiamat cried out loud and furiously, 

To the very roots her two legs shook back and forth. 

She recites an incantation, repeatedly casting her spell; 

As for the gods of battle, they sharpen their weapons. 

Tiamat and Marduk, the wisest of the gods, advanced against one another; 

They pressed on to single combat, they approached for battle. 247 

Marduk fills Tiamat with “an evil wind,” which distends her belly. When she opens her 
mouth to devour him, he lets an arrow fly, which tears her interior, and splits her heart. 
He subdues her, completely, casts down her carcass, and stands upon it. His voluntarily 
encounter with the forces of the unknown produces a decisive victory. He rounds up her 
subordinates—including Kingu, whom he deprives of the tablet of destinies—and 
encapsulates them with netting. Then he returns to Tiamat: 

The lord trod upon the hinder part of Tiamat, 

And with his unsparing club he split her skull. 

He cut the arteries of her blood 

And caused the north wind to carry it to out-of-the-way places.... 

He split her open like a mussel into two parts; 

Half of her he set in place and formed the sky (therewith) as a roof. 

He fixed the crossbar and posted guards; 

He commanded them not to let her waters escape. 

He crossed the heavens and examined the regions. 

He placed himself opposite the Apsu, the dwelling of Ea. 

The lord measured the dimensions of the Apsu, 

And a great structure, he established, namely Esharra [Earth].” 248 

Marduk then constructs the heavenly order, fashioning the year, defining the twelve-sign 
zodiac, determining the movement of the stars, the planets and the moon. 249 Finally, he 
deigns to create man (out of Kingu, the greatest and most guilty of Tiamat’s allies), so 
that “upon him shall the services of the gods be imposed that they may be at rest”; 250 then 
he returns the gods allied with him to their appropriate celestial abodes. Grateful, they 
deliver him a present: 



Maps of Meaning 123 


Now, O Lord, who hast established our freedom from compulsory service, 

What shall be the sign of our gratitude before thee? 

Come, let us make something whose name shall be called “Sanctuary.” 

It shall be a dwelling for our rest at night; come, let us repose therein! 251 

The dwelling is Babylon, center of civilization, mythic sacred space, dedicated in 
perpetuity to Marduk. 

The mythic tale of the Enuma elish describes the nature of the eternal relationship 
between the (unknowable) source of all things, the “gods” who rule human life, and the 
subject or process who constructs determinate experience, through voluntary encounter 
with the unknown. The “frill story” presented in the Sumerian creation myth is presented, 
schematically, in Figure 22: The Enuma elish in Schematic Representation. Tiamat is 
portrayed, simultaneously, as the thing that breeds everything (as the mother of all the 
gods); as the thing that destroys all things; as the consort of a patriarchal spiritual 
principle, upon who creation also depends (Apsu); and, finally, as the thing that is cut 
into pieces by the hero who constructs the world. Marduk, the last-born “child” of 
instinct, is the hero who voluntarily faces the creative/destructive power that constitutes 
the “place” from which all things emerge. He is the martial deity, role model for the 
culture of the West, who violently carves the unknown into pieces, and makes the 
predictable world from those pieces. 

This tale contains within it a complex and sophisticated notion of causality. None of 
its elements exists in contradiction with any other, even though each lays stress on 
different aspects of the same process. Something must exist, prior to the construction of 
identifiable things (something that cannot be imagined, in the absence of a subject). That 
thing might usefully be portrayed as the “all-devouring mother of everything.” The 
particular, discriminable, familiar elements of human experience exist as they do, 
however, because the conscious subject can detect, construct and transform them. The 
“son-hero’s” role in the “birth” of things is therefore as primal as the mother’s, although 
this part is somewhat more difficult to comprehend. Nonetheless, the Sumerians manage 
the representation, in narrative form. It is a relatively small step from this 
dramatic/imagistic portrayal of the hero to the most explicit Christian doctrine of 
Logos —the creative Word (and from there to our notion of “consciousness”). 

The mythic tale of Marduk and Tiamat refers to the capacity of the individual to 
explore, voluntarily, and to bring things into being as a consequence. The hero cuts the 
world of the unpredictable—unexplored territory, signified by Tiamat—into its 
distinguishable elements;

weaves a net of determinate meaning, capable of encompassing the vast unknown; 
embodies the divine “masculine” essence, which has as its most significant feature the 
capacity to transform chaos into order. The killing of an all-embracing monster and the 
construction of the universe from its body parts is symbolic (metaphorical) representation 
of the central, adaptive process of heroic encounter with the undifferentiated unknown, 
and the construction or generation of differentiated order as a consequence. It is this 
process, emulated by the emperor of Mesopotamia (who ritually embodied Marduk), that 
served as the basis for his authority—and, indeed, that serves to undergird the idea of 
lawful authority to the present day. The Mesopotamian emperor’s identification with the 
most divine of all the deities (according to the judgment and election of those selfsame 
powers) lent him power, and served to maintain social and psychological order among his 
people. Furthermore, the Mesopotamian emperor stood in the same relationship to his 
people as Marduk stood to him: as ritual model for emulation, as the personality whose 
actions served as pattern for all actions undertaken in the kingdom—as the personality 
that was the state, insofar as the state defined and brought order to interpersonal 
interactions (which, after all, was and is its primary function). Babylon was therefore 
conceptualized as “the kingdom of god on earth”—that is, as a profane imitation of 
heaven. The emperor served this “imitated heaven” as the “imitator of Marduk,” at least 
insofar as he was conservative, just, courageous and creative. Eliade comments on the 









Maps of Meaning 125 


sacrality of the Mesopotamian sovereign, and describes the rituals designed to maintain 
that sacrality: 

At Babylon the Enuma elish was recited in the temple on the fourth day of 
the New Year festival. This festival, named zagmuk (“beginning of the 
year”) in Sumerian and akitu in Akkadian [note: the Sumerians and 
Akkadians united to form Babylon], took place during the first twelve 
days of the month of Nisan. It comprised several sequences, of which we 
will mention the most important: (1) a day of expiation for the king, 
corresponding to Marduk’s “captivity”; (2) the freeing of Marduk; (3) 
ritual combats and a triumphal procession, led by the king, to the Bit Akitu 
(the house of the New Year festival), where a banquet was held; (4) the 
hieros gamos [mystical marriage] of the king with a hierodule [ritual 
slave/prostitute] personifying the goddess; and (5) the determination of 
destinies by the gods. 252 

The meaning of some terminology, and the nature of the latter two sequences, must be 
clarified here: 

First [with regard to (4)], it should be noted that hieros gamos means mystical 
marriage —the marriage of the king, and the queen or goddess. This marriage provides 
dramatic representation of the union of the exploratory tendency (incarnated by the king) 
with the positive aspect of the unknown, incarnated by the hierodule. Marduk (the king) 
is originally “shut up,” signifying his temporary disappearance (see the description of 
Osiris, below) during the normal or routinized operations of the state. He is freed, to meet 
Tiamat; he does so, in sexual union. This sexual (read: creative) union—the juxtaposition 
of the process of knowing, embodied by the king (Marduk), with the unknown, embodied 
by Tiamat (incarnated by the hierodule )—is what gives rise to the generation of new 
information and patterns of adaptation. The process of generating knowledge is therefore 
assimilated to the domain of sexual union, as the primordial creative process. The deity of 
chaos, or the unknown, appears most generally as feminine (and as half-negative, and 
half-positive) once the initial division between order and chaos has been established. The 
attribution of femininity to this deity, so to speak, occurs most fundamentally because the 
unknown serves as the matrix from which determinate forms are borne. The negative 
attribution (Tiamat serves as example) exists because the unknown has a destructive 
aspect; the positive (the hierodule here, Isis in the Egyptian myth of Osiris, Mary in 
Christianity) because the unknown is also creative or generative. 

Second [with regard to (5)], it should be noted that the king (in his incarnation as god) 
served to “determine destinies” because he was both hero—ritual model for emulation— 
and absolute ruler. As such, he literally controlled individual destinies, serving as he did, 
practically and in representation, as the most powerful individual in society, and the most 
dominant “strategy” in the hierarchy of behavioral adaptation. What he could not 
determine, by law, however, he was to provide by creative example (since the “body of 
laws,” as embodiment of past wisdom, is insufficient to deal with the challenges of the 
present). This idea is developed much more explicitly by the Egyptians, as we shall see. 
Back to Eliade’s story: 



Maps of meaning 126 


The first sequence of this mythico-ritual scenario—the king’s humiliation 
and Marduk’s captivity—indicates the regression of the world to the 
precosmogonic chaos. In the sanctuary of Marduk the high priest stripped 
the king of his emblems (scepter, ring, scimitar and crown) and struck him 
in the face. Then, on his knees, the king uttered a declaration of 
innocence: “I have not sinned, O lord of the lands, I have not been 
negligent regarding thy divinity.” The high priest, speaking in Marduk’s 
name, replied: “Do not fear.... Marduk will hear thy prayer. He will 
increase thy dominion.” 

During this time the people sought for Marduk, supposed to be “shut 
up in the mountain” (a formula indicating the “death” of a divinity).. .[in 
consequence of a descent] “far from the sun and light.”... 

[When the world “regresses” to “precosmogonic chaos,” it is always the case that the 
hero is missing. The hero is, after all, incarnation of the process by which chaos is 
transformed into order. If chaos has the upper hand, it is by definition because of a 
current paucity of heroism. It can be said, therefore, that the reappearance of the Great 
Mother, in her terrible guise, the death of the Great Father (who serves as protection from 
his creative and destructive wife), and the absence of the hero (who turns chaos into 
order) all represent different ways of telling the same story—the story which describes a 
life-threatening imbalance in the powers of the constituent elements of experience. Eliade 
continues, describing the “rediscovery” or “reemergence” of Marduk.] 

...Finally, he was delivered, and the gods assembled (that is, their statues 
were brought together) to determine the destinies. (This episode 
corresponds, in the Enuma elish, to Marduk’s advancement to the rank of 
supreme god.) The king led the procession to the Bit Akitu, a building 
situated outside of the city [outside the domain of civilization, or order]. 

The procession represented the army of the gods advancing against 
Tiamat. According to an inscription of Sennacherib, we may suppose that 
the primordial battle was mimed, the king personifying Assur (the god 
who had replaced Marduk). The hieros gamos took place after the return 
from the banquet at the Bit Akitu. The last act consisted in the 
determination of the destinies for each month of the year. By 
“determining” it, the year was ritually created, that is, the good fortune, 
fertility, and richness of the new world that had just been born were 
insured.... The role of the king in the akitu is inadequately known. His 
“humiliation” corresponds to the regression of the world to chaos and to 
Marduk’s captivity in the mountain. The king personifies the god in the 
battle against Tiamat and in the hieros gamos with a hierodule. But 
identification with the god is not always indicated; as we have seen, 
during his humiliation the king addresses Marduk. Nevertheless, the 
sacrality of the Mesopotamian sovereign is amply documented.... 

Though the king recognized his earthly begetting, he was considered a 
“son of god.’’...This twofold descent made him supremely the 
intermediary between gods and men. The sovereign represented the 



Maps of Meaning 127 


people before the gods, and it was he who expiated the sins of his 
subjects. Sometimes he had to suffer death for his people’s crimes; this is 
why the Assyrians had a “substitute for the king.” The texts pro-claim that 
the king had lived in fellowship with the gods in the fabulous garden that 
contains the Tree of Life and the Water of Life.... The king is the “envoy” 
of the gods, the “shepherd of the people,” named by god to establish 
justice and peace on earth.... 

It could be said that the king shared in the divine modality, but without 
becoming a god. He represented the god, and this, on the archaic levels of 
culture, also implied that he was, in a way, he whom he personified. In 
any case, as mediator between the world of men and the world of the 
gods, the Mesopotamian king effected, in his own person, a ritual union 
between the two modalities of existence, the divine and the human. It was 
by virtue of this twofold nature that the king was considered, at least 
metaphorically, to be the creator of life and fertility. 253 

Marduk, in his manifestation as Namtillaku, was also “the god who restores to life,” 254 
who can restore all “ruined gods, as though they were his own creation; The lord who by 
holy incantation restore[s] the dead gods to life.” 255 This idea echoes through ancient 
Egyptian theology, as described below. Marduk was Namshub, as well, “the bright god 
who brightens our way” 25 •—which once again assimilates him to the sun—and Asaru, the 
god of resurrection, who “causes the green herb to spring up.” 257 Whatever Marduk 
represents was also considered central to creation of rich abundance, to mercy, and 
justice, 260 to familial love, 261 and, most interestingly, to the “creation of ingenious things” 
from the “conflict with Tiamat.” 262 [!!!] He was in fact addressed by fifty names by the 
Mesopotamians. Each name signified an independent valuable attribute or property 
(likely at one time separate gods), now regarded as clearly dependent for its existence 
upon him. It seems evident that the attribution of these fifty names to Marduk parallels 
the movement toward monotheism described in the Enuma elish itself (with all the gods 
organizing themselves voluntarily under Marduk’s dominion) and occurring in 
Mesopotamian society, at the human and historical level. It might be said that the 
Mesopotamians “came to realize” (in ritual and image, at least) that all the life-sustaining 
processes that they worshiped in representation were secondary aspects of the 
exploratory/creative/rejuvenating process embodied by Marduk. 

A similar pattern of ritual and secondary conceptualization characterized ancient 
Egyptian society. In the earliest Egyptian cosmology (circa 2700 B.C.), the god Ptah, a 
spiritualized manifestation of Alum, the all-encircling serpent, creates “by his mind (his 
‘heart’) and his word (his ‘tongue’).” 263 Eliade states: 

Ptah is proclaimed the greatest god, Atum being considered only the 
author of the first divine couple. It is Ptah “who made the gods exist.”... 

In short, the theogony and the cosmogony are effected by the creative 
power of the thought and word of a single god. We here certainly have the 
highest expression of Egyptian metaphysical speculation. As John Wilson 
observes, 264 it is at the beginning of Egyptian history that we find a 



Maps of meaning 128 


doctrine that can be compared with the Christian theology of the Logos 
[or Word]. 265 

The Egyptians “realized” that consciousness and linguistic ability were vital to the 
existence of things—precisely as vital as the unknowable matrix of their being. This idea 
still has not hilly permeated our explicit understanding (since we attribute the existence 
of things purely to their material “substrate”), despite its centrality to Christian thinking. 
The Egyptians viewed Ptah—the spermatic word—as the original, or primordial (read 
“heavenly” king). As in Mesopotamia, essentially, he ceded this power, in the earthly 
domain, to his successor, the pharaoh [his “actual” or “literal” son, from the Egyptian 
viewpoint (as the Pharaoh was viewed as god)]. The creative power thus transferred was 
literally defined by the Egyptians as the ability to put order (ma at) “in the place of 
Chaos.” 266 Eliade comments: 

It is these same terms that are used of Tut-ankh-Amon when he restored 
order after the “heresy” of Akh-en-Aton, or of Pepi II: “He put ma c at in 
the place of falsehood (of disorder).” Similarly, the verb khay, “to shine,” 
is used indifferently to depict the emergence of the sun at the moment of 
creation or at each dawn and the appearance of the pharaoh at the 
coronation ceremony, at festivals, or at the privy council. 

The pharaoh is the incarnation of ma c at, a term translated by “truth” 
but whose general meaning is “good order” and hence “right,” “justice.” 

Ma c at belongs to the original creation; hence it reflects the perfection of 
the Golden Age. Since it constitutes the very foundation of the cosmos 
and life, ma c at can be known by each individual separately. In texts of 
different origins and periods, there are such declarations as these: “Incite 
your heart to know ma c at ”; “I make thee to know the thing of ma c at in 
thy heart; mayest thou do what is right for thee!” Or: “I was a man who 
loved ma c at and hated sin. For I knew that (sin) is an abomination to 
God.” And in fact it is God who bestows the necessary knowledge. A 
prince is defined as “one who knows truth (ma c at) and whom God 
teaches.” The author of a prayer to Re cries: “Mayest Thou give me ma c at 
in my heart!” 

As incarnating ma c at, the pharaoh constitutes the paradigmatic 
example for all his subjects. As the vizier Rekh-mi-Re expresses it: “He is 
a god who makes us live by his acts.” The work of the pharaoh insures the 
stability of the cosmos and the state and hence the continuity of life. And 
indeed the cosmogony is repeated every morning, when the solar god 
“repels” the serpent Apophis, though without being able to destroy him; 
for chaos (=the original darkness) represents virtuality; hence it is 
indestructible. The pharaoh’s political activity repeats Re’s exploit: he too 
“repels ’’ Apophis, in other words he sees to it that the world does not 
return to chaos. When enemies appear at the frontiers, they will be 
assimilated to Apophis [the god of primordial chaos], and the pharaoh’s 
victory will reproduce Re’s triumph [emphasis added]. 267

The ideas of kingship, creativity and renewal are given a different and more sophisticated 
slant in the central myth of Osiris, which served as an alternate basis for Egyptian 
theology. 

The story of Osiris and his son Homs is much more complex, in some ways, than the 
Mesopotamian creation myth, or the story of Re, and describes the interactions between 
the “constituent elements of experience” in exceedingly compressed form. Osiris was a 
primeval king, a legendary ancestral figure, who ruled Egypt wisely and fairly. His evil 
brother, Seth —whom he did not understand 268 —rose up against him. Figure 23: The 
Battle Between Osiris and Seth in the Domain of Order portrays this conflict as a “war” 
in the “(heavenly) domain of order.” Seth kills Osiris (that is, sends him to the 
underworld) and dismembers his body, so 



Figure 23: The Battle Between Osiris and Seth in the 
Domain of Order 

that it can never be “found.” Figure 24: The Involuntary Descent and Disintegration of 
Osiris portrays Osiris’ “involuntary descent and disintegration,” and his quasi- 
existence” in the underworld of chaos. 

The death of Osiris signifies two important things: (1) the tendency of a (static) ruling 
idea, system of valuation, or particular story—no matter how initially magnificent or 
appropriate—to become increasingly irrelevant with time; and (2) the dangers that 
necessarily accrue to a state that “forgets” or refuses to admit to the existence of the 







Maps of meaning 130 


immortal deity of evil. Seth, the king’s brother and opposite, represents the mythic 
“hostile twin” or “adversary” who eternally opposes the process of creative encounter 
with the unknown; signifies, alternatively speaking, a pattern of adaptation characterized 
by absolute opposition to establishment of divine order. When this principle gains 
control—that is, usurps the throne—the “rightful king” and his kingdom are necessarily 
doomed. Seth, and figures like him—often represented in narrative by the corrupt 
“righthand man” or “adviser to the once-great king”—view human existence itself with 
contempt. Such figures are motivated only to protect or advance their position in the 
power hierarchy, even when the prevailing order is clearly 



Figure 24: The Involuntary Descent and 
Disintegration of Osiris 

counterproductive. Their actions necessarily speed the process of decay, endemic to all 
structures. Osiris, although great, was naive in some profound sense—blind, at least, to 
the existence of “immortal” evil. This blindness, and its resultant incaution, brings about 
(or at least hastens) Osiris’ demise. 

Osiris has a wife, as befits the “king of order.” Isis, as Osiris’ mythic counterpart, is 
representative of the positive aspect of the unknown (like the hierodule in the 
Mesopotamian New Year’s ritual). She is possessed of great magical powers, as might be 
expected, given her status. She gathers up Osiris’ scattered pieces and makes herself 
pregnant with the use of his dismembered phallus. This story makes a profound point: the 
degeneration of the state or domain of order and its descent into chaos serves merely to 


Maps of Meaning 131 


fructify that domain and to make it “pregnant.” In chaos lurks great potential. When a 
great organization disintegrates, falls into pieces, the pieces might still usefully be 
fashioned into, or give rise to, something else (perhaps something more vital, and still 
greater). Isis therefore gives birth to a son, Horus, who returns to his rightful kingdom to 
confront his evil uncle. This process is schematically represented in Figure 25: The Birth 
and Return of Horus, Divine Son of Order and Chaos. 

Horus fights a difficult battle with Seth—as the forces of evil are difficult to 
overcome— 



Figure 25: The Birth and Return of Horus, Divine 
Son of Order and Chaos 

and loses an eye in the process. Seth is overcome, nonetheless; Horus recovers his eye. 
The story could stop there, narrative integrity intact, with the now-whole and victorious 
Horus’ well-deserved ascension to the throne. However, Homs does the unexpected, 
descending voluntarily to the underworld to find his father (as portrayed schematically in 
Figure 26: Voluntary Encounter with the Underworld). It is representation of this 
move—reminiscent ofMarduk’s voluntary journey to the “underworld” of Tiamat—that 
constitutes the brilliant and original contribution of Egyptian theology. 

Horus discovers Osiris, extant in a state of torpor. He offers his recovered eye to his 
father—so that Osiris can “see,” once again. They return, united and victorious, and 
establish a revivified kingdom. The kingdom of the “son and father” is an improvement 


Maps of meaning 132 


over that of the father or the son alone, as it unites the hard-won wisdom of the past (that 
is, of the dead) with the adaptive capacity of the present (that is, of the living). The 
(re)establishment and improvement of the domain of order is schematically represented 
in Figure 27: Ascent, and Reintegration of the Father. 

In the story of Osiris, the senescence/death of the father (presented as a consequence 
of 



Figure 26: Voluntary Encounter with the Underworld 

the treachery of Seth) is overcome by the mythic son, the hero who (temporarily) defeats 
the power of evil, and who rejuvenates the father. Marduk, the Mesopotamian supreme 
god, is by comparison a straightforward hero: he carves the familiar world from the 
unfamiliar. Horus, equally brave, is more complete, and more sophisticated. He cannot 
remain content with his own ascension, feeling himself incomplete without his father. He 
therefore journeys voluntarily into the underworld, releases the disintegrated forces of 
tradition trapped there, and makes them part of himself. This pattern of behavior 
constitutes an elaboration of that represented by Marduk—or of Re, the Egyptian sun- 
god. 

Marduk creates order from chaos. That capacity, which is theoretically embodied in 
the form of the Mesopotamian emperor, lends temporal authority its rightful power. The 
same idea, elaborated substantially, applies in Egypt. Osiris constitutes the old state, once 
great, but dangerously anachronistic. Horus partakes of the essence of tradition (he is the 




Maps of Meaning 133 


son of his father), blit is vivified by an infusion of “new information” (his mother, after 
all, is “the positive aspect of the unknown”). As an updated version of his father, he is 
capable of dealing with the problems of the present (that is, with the emergent evil 
represented by his uncle). Victorious over his uncle, he is nonetheless incomplete, as his 
youthful spirit lacks the 



Figure 27: Ascent, and Reintegration of the Father 

wisdom of the past. So he journeys into the unknown, where his father rests, “lifeless”— 
that is, uncomprehended; without embodiment or incarnation (in action) in the present. 
Horns unites himself with his father and becomes the ideal ruler—the consciousness of 
present youthful life, conjoined with the wisdom of tradition. 

The “dead” Egyptian pharaoh—that is, the ruler whose death preceded the ascension 
of the current pharaoh—was assimilated to (occupied the same categorical space as) 
Osiris. That meant he was regarded as equivalent to “the spirit that founded the state”— 
the archetypal creator-god or legendary ancestor whose courageous actions had 
cosmogonic significance. The current ruler (who depended for much of his power on the 
traditions of his predecessors, modified when necessary) was regarded as equivalent to 
Horus and to Re, the sun-god. The ruling pharaoh was therefore the power that generated 
order from chaos (as Re), and the power that rejuvenated order, once it had degenerated 
into unthinking authoritarianism or too-rigid (and blind) tradition. Furthermore, however, 






Maps of meaning 134 


he was the rejuvenated Osiris (who was the “dead pharaoh”)—so he was tradition, given 
sight. The sophistication of this idea of reputable leadership—creative power, 
regenerative power and revivified tradi-tion—can hardly be regarded as anything but 
remarkable. It is also of overwhelming historical interest and modern relevance that the 
Egyptians increasingly came to regard Osiris-Horus as an examplar, not just of the 
pharaoh, but of every individual in the kingdom. Eliade states, with regard to later 
Egyptian burial practice: 

The texts formerly inscribed on the walls of the hidden chambers in the 
pyramids erected for the pharaohs are now reproduced inside the coffins 
of the nobility and even of totally unprivileged people. Osiris becomes the 
model for all those who hope to conquer death. A Coffin Text proclaims: 

“Thou art now the son of a king, a prince, as long as thy heart (i.e., spirit) 
shall be with thee.” Following Osiris’ example, and with his help, the 
dead are able to transform themselves into “souls,” that is, into perfectly 
integrated and hence indestructible spiritual beings. Murdered and 
dismembered, Osiris was “reconstituted” by Isis and reanimated by Horus. 

In this way he inaugurated a new mode of existence: from a powerless 
shade, he became a “person” who “knows,” a duly initiated spiritual 
being. 269 

This development might also be regarded as an illustration of the increasing 
psychologization, abstraction and internalization of religious ideation: in the earliest 
stages of representation, deities are viewed as pluralistic, and as individualistic and 
fractious members of a supracelestial (that is, transpersonal and immortal) community. 
Later, they are integrated into a hierarchy, as the culture becomes more integrated, more 
sure about relative valuation and moral virtue—and a single god, with a multitude of 
related features, comes to dominate. Development of monotheism thus parallels 
intrapsychic and intracultural moral integration. As the average citizen identifies more 
and more clearly with this monotheistic, integrated pattern, its external nature, as an 
attribute of the gods, recedes. It becomes more clearly an attribute of the individual 
human being, and more like what we would conceive of as a psychological trait. The 
god’s subjective aspect—his or her intrapsychic quality—becomes more evident, at least 
to the most sophisticated of intuitions, and the possibility of “personal relationship” with 
the deity emerges as a prospect at the conceptual level of analysis. The process is just 
begining, in abstraction, in Mesopotamia and Egypt; the ancient Israelites bring it most 
clearly to fruition, with potent and lasting effect. It does not seem unreasonable to regard 
this development as a precursor to the Christian revolution—which granted every 
individual the status of “son of god”—and as implicitly akin to our modern notion of the 
intrinsic “human right.” 

The Egyptian pharaoh, like the Mesopotamian king, served as material incarnation of 
the process that separates order from chaos; simultaneously, the pharaoh/king literally 
embodied the state. Finally, the pharoah/king was the rejuvenator of his own “father.” 
The “ideal” pharaoh/king was therefore the exploratory process that gave rise to the state, 
the state itself, and the revivifying (exploratory) process that updated the state when it 
was in danger of too-conservative ossification. This massively complex and sophisticated 



Maps of Meaning 135 


conceptualization is given added breadth and depth by consideration of its psychological 
element. The state is not merely cultural; it is also “spiritual.” As custom and tradition is 
established, it is inculcated into each individual, and becomes part of their intrapsychic 
structure. The state is therefore personality and social organization, simultaneously— 
personality and social order conjoined in the effort to keep the terror of chaos at bay (or, 
better still, united in the effort to make something positively useful of it). This means that 
the hero/king who establishes, embodies and updates the social world is also the same 
force that establishes, embodies and updates the intrapsychic world, the personality ’—and 
that one act of update cannot necessarily or reasonably be distinguished from the other. In 
“improving” the world, the hero improves himself; in improving himself, he sets an 
example for the world. 

Initially, the “personality of state” was in fact a ritual human model (a hero) to observe 
and imitate (an entity represented in behavioral pattern); then a story about such ritual 
models (an entity represented in imagination), and, finally—and only much later—an 
abstract construction of rules describing the explicit rights and responsibilities of the 
citizenry—(an entity of words, the “body” of law). This increasingly abstract and detailed 
construction develops from imitation to abstract representation, and comprises rules and 
schemas of interpretations useful for maintaining stability of interpersonal interaction. 
The establishment of these rules and schemas gives determinate meaning to human 
experience, by bringing predictability to all social situations (to all things encountered 
interpersonally). The same thing might be said from the psychological perspective. It is 
incorporation of the “personality of state,” dominated by the figure of the hero, that 
brings order to the inner community of necessity and desire, to the generative chaos of 
the soul. 

The Mesopotamian culture-hero/deity Marduk represents the capacity of the process 
of exploration to generate the world of experience; the Egyptian gods Horus-Osiris 
represent the extended version of that capacity, which means not only generation of the 
world from the unknown, but transformation of the pattern of adaptation which 
constitutes the known, when such transformation becomes necessary. 

Sometimes “adaptation” is merely a matter of the adjustment of the means to an end. 
More rarely, but equally necessarily, adaptation is reconceptualization of “what is 
known” (unbearable present, desirable future and means to attain such) because what is is 
known is out of date, and therefore deadly. It is the sum of these processes that manifests 
itself in the Judeo-Christian tradition as the mythic Word of God (and which is embodied 
in Christ, the Christian culture-hero). This is the force that generates subject and object 
from the primordial chaos (and, therefore, which “predates” the existence of both); the 
force that engenders the tradition that makes vulnerable existence possible, in the face of 
constant mortal threat; and the force that updates protective tradition when it has become 
untenable and tyrannical on account of its age. 

The Sumerian and Egyptian myths portray ideas of exceeding complexity, in ritual, 
drama, and imagistic form. This form is not purposeful mystification, but the manner in 
which ideas emerge, before they are sufficiently developed to be explicitly 
comprehensible. We acted out and provisionally formulated complete, “impressionistic” 
models of the world of experience (which was the world we always had to understand) 
long before the “contents” of such models could be understood in the way we currently 
conceive of understanding.

theologies to political action, shed substantial light on the manner in which many of our 
most important modern ideas developed (and on what those ideas actually mean). This 
understanding, derived from two or three specific examples, can be further enhanced 
through more general discussion. We therefore turn our attention from analysis of 
complete stories—which have as their advantage a more compelling nature—to detailed 
description of the mythological characters whose essence and interactions constitute the 
world. The totality of the world, which includes the significance of experienced things, as 
well as the things themselves, is composed of what has been explored and rendered 
familiar; what has yet to be encountered, and is therefore unpredictable; and the process 
that mediates between the two. One final element must be additionally considered: the 
state of being that includes or precedes the division of everything into these three 
constituent elements. This state might be regarded as the true source of all things, 
subjects and objects—the single ancestor and final destination of all. The complete 
mythological ‘‘world of experience” is portrayed schematically in Figure 28: The 
Constituent Elements of Experience as Personality, Territory and Process. Our 
discussion turns first to the diverse nature of representations of the original, 
undifferentiated state (the condition of primordial chaos) and then to a more elaborated 
description of its “children”—the divine parents, nature and culture, and the divine son, 
simultaneously child, primal creator and eternal adversary.

The Dragon of Primordial Chaos 

The source of things is the boundless. From whence they arise, thence 
they must also of necessity return. For they do penance and make com 
pensation to one another for their injustice in the order of time." 70 


It might seem futile to speculate about the nature of that which existed prior to any 
experience, or that which has not yet been explored. Futile or not, such speculation has 
occupied a good portion of man’s time, as he attempted to understand the mystery of his 
emergence and of the world he found himself occupying. It seems impossible to 
determine what it is that was before anything was; myth attempts that task, despite its 
impossibility. It does so using the tool of metaphor. The metaphorical statements of myth 
work because unknown or partially known things inevitably share characteristics of 
importance with somewhat more thoroughly investigated, comprehended and familiar 
things. Two or more objects or situations come to occupy the same mythological or 
categorical space, therefore, because they share similar form, function or capacity to 
induce affect and compel behavior. A mandrake root, for example, has the nature of a 
man, symbolically speaking, because it has the shape of a man; Mars is a warlike planet 
because it is red, and red, the color of blood, is associated indelibly with aggression; the 
metal mercury (and the “spirit” that inhabits it) is akin to seawater because both may 
serve as solvents or agents of transformation; the dark and the animal of the forest are the 
same, because they are both unfamiliar—because they both inhibit ongoing behavior, 
when they make their appearance; because they both cause fear. Metaphor links thing to 
thing, situation to situation, concentrating on the phenomenological, affective, functional 
and motivational features the linked situations share. Through such linkage, what might 
otherwise remain entirely mysterious can begin to become comprehended. 

Myths of the origin metaphorically portray the nature of the infinite potential that 
characterized being prior to the dawn of experience. This general symbolic construction 
takes many particular forms, each of which might be said to constitute a partial attempt to 
represent the unrepresentable whole. These particular forms range in nature from the 
specific and concrete to the general and abstract, and are influenced in their development 
by the environmental and cultural conditions obtaining at the time of their emergence. 
The process of metaphorical representation provides a bridge—and an increasingly 
communicable bridge—between what can be directly explored, experienced and 
“comprehended,” and what remains eternally unknown. 

Mythic symbols of the chaos of the beginning are imaginative pictures, whose purpose 
is representation of a paradoxical totality, a “state” (which is already to say something too 
determinate) self-contained, uniform and complete, where everything now distinct resides 
in union: a state where being and nonbeing, beginning and end, matter and energy, spirit 
and body, consciousness and unconsciousness, femininity and masculinity, night and day 
remain compounded, prior to their discrimination into the separable elements of 
experience. In this “state,” all conceivable pairs of opposites and contradictory forces 
exist together, within the all-encompassing embrace of an omniscient, omnipresent, 
omnipotent and altogether mysterious God. This “paradisal” precondition, lacking 
nothing, characterized by absolute completion, exists in contradistinction to the profane 
world, imperfect and partial, suspended unbearably in time and in space; it surrounds that 



Maps of meaning 138 


world completely, like the night surrounds the day, comprising the beginning of things, 
the fountainhead for everything and, similarly, the resting place and destination point for 
all. William James turned to poetry in his attempt to conceptualize this “place”: 

No verbiage can give it, because the verbiage is other, 

Incoherent, coherent—same. 

And it fades! And it’s infinite! AND it’s infinite!... 

Don’t you see the difference, don’t you see the identity? 

Constantly opposites united! 

The same me telling you to write and not to write! 

Extreme—extreme, extreme!... 

Something, and other than that thing! 

Intoxication, and otherness than intoxication. 

Every attempt at betterment,—every attempt at otherment 

—is a— 

It fades forever and forever as we move. 271 

This state—“the totality of all things”—might be regarded as the objective world, in the 
absence of the subject, although this conceptualization is too narrow, as primordial chaos 
also contains that which evolves into the subject, when it is differentiated. What might be 
regarded as the standard objective viewpoint is predicated on the idea that “things” as 
they are perceived exist regardless of the perceiver. From a certain perspective, this is 
true. Things have a nature that appears independent of subjective will, and follow their 
own laws of being and development—despite our wishes. Flowever, the job of 
determining what a thing is in the absence of the subject is much more difficult than 
might initially be imagined. It is certainly the case—as we have seen—that the value of 
an object can shift with shifts in frame of reference. It appears to be true, however, that 
what an object is “is and of itself’ is also subject to such shift. Any given object—a table, 
say—exists as a table because it is apprehended only in a very limited and restrained 
manner. Something is a table at a particular and isolated level of analysis, specified by 
the nature of the observer. In the absence of this observer, one might ask, what is it that is 
being apprehended? Is the proper level of analysis and specification subatomic, atomic or 
molecular (or all three at once)? Should the table be considered an indistinguishable 
element of the earth upon which it rests, or of the solar system, which contains the earth, 
or of the galaxy itself? The same problem obtains from the perspective of temporality. 
What is now table was once tree; before that, earth—before that, rock; before that, star. 
What is now table also has before it an equally complex and lengthy developmental 
history waiting in “front” of it; it will be, perhaps, ash, then earth, then—far enough in 
the future—part of the sun again (when the sun finally re-envelops the earth). The table is 
what it “is” only at a very narrow span of spatial and temporal resolution (the span that 
precisely characterizes our consciousness). So what is the table as an “independent 
object”—“free,” that is, of the restrictions that characterize the evidently limited human 
viewpoint? What is it that can be conceptualized at all spatial and temporal levels of 
analysis simultaneously? Does the “existence” of the thing include its interactions with 
everything it influences, and is influenced by, gravitationally and electromagnetically? Is 
that “thing” everything it once was, everything it is, and everything it will be, all at the 



Maps of Meaning 139 


same time? Where then are its borders? How can it be distinguished from other things? 
And without such distinction, in what manner can it be said to exist? 

Question: what is an object, in the absence of a frame of reference? Answer: it is 
everything conceivable, at once—is something that constitutes the union of all currently 
discriminable opposites (and something that cannot, therefore, be easily distinguished 
from nothing). 

I am not saying that there are no such things as “things”—that would of course be 
patently absurd. It is also hilly apparent that the things we apprehend are rule-governed— 
the cosmos as we experience it is orderly and rationally comprehensible. What I am 
claiming is that “objective” things are in fact the product of an interaction between 
whatever constitutes our limited consciousness and whatever constitutes the unlimited 
“background” that makes up the world, in the absence of a subject. This is a stance 
informed by mythology—in particular, by myths of the origin. 

Archaic myths describing the ultimate origin concern themselves with representation 
of the source, not of objects, in the modern sense, but of subjects and the experience of 
those subjects (some part of which can be regarded as objects). Such myths typically 
describe the genesis of the world of experience by relating the existence of a primordial 
god, portraying the division of this god into the world-parents, and detailing the 
separation of those parents by their own “son.” This is the division of the hermaphroditic, 
all-encompassing, self-devouring and nourishing serpent of chaos into earth/matter and 
sky/spirit, and the subsequent discrimination of those “primordial opposing forces” into 
identifiable aspects of being. The Indo-European myth of Indra and V tra provides a 
representative example: 

The central myth of Indra, which is, furthermore, the most important myth 
in the Rig Veda, narrates his victorious battle against V tra, the gigantic 
dragon who held back the waters in the “hollow of the mountains.” 
Strengthened by soma, Indra lays the serpent low with his vajra 
(“thunderbolt”), the weapon forged by Tva , splits open his head, and 
frees the waters, which pour into the sea “like bellowing cows.” (RV 1.32) 

The battle of a god against an ophidian or marine monster is well 
known to constitute a widespread mythological theme. We need only 
remember the struggle between Re and Apophis, between the Sumerian 
god Ninurta and Asag, Marduk and Tiamat, the Hittite storm god and the 
serpent Illuyankas, Zeus and Typhon, the Iranian hero Thraetona and the 
three-headed dragon Azhi-dahaka. In certain cases (Marduk-Tiamat, for 
example) the god’s victory constitutes the preliminary condition for the 
cosmogony. In other cases the stake is the inauguration of a new era or the 
establishment of a new sovereignty (cf. Zeus-Typhon, Baal-Yam). In 
short, it is by the slaying of an ophidian monster—symbol of the virtual, 
of “chaos,” but also of the “autochthonous”—that a new cosmic or 
institutional “situation” comes into existence. A characteristic feature, and 
one common to all these myths, is the fright, or a first defeat, of the 
champion (Marduk and Re hesitate before fighting; at the onset, the 
serpent Illyunakas succeeds in mutilating the god; Typhon succeeds in 
cutting and carrying off Zeus’s tendons). According to the Satapatha 



Maps of meaning 140 


Brahma a (1.6.3-17), Indra, on first seeing V tra, runs away as far as 
possible, and the Marka a eya Pura a describes him as “sick with 
fear” and hoping for peace. 272 

It would serve no purpose to dwell on the naturalistic interpretations of 
this myth; the victory over V tra has been seen either as rain brought on 
by a thunderstorm or as the freeing of the mountain waters (Oldenberg) or 
as the triumphs of the sun over the cold that had “imprisoned” the waters 
by freezing them (Hillebrandt). Certainly, naturalistic elements are 
present, since the myth is multivalent; Indra’s victory is equivalent, 
among other things, to the triumph of life over the sterility and death 
resulting from the immobilization of the waters by V tra. But the 
structure of the myth is cosmogonic. In Rig Veda 1.33.4 it is said that, by 
his victory, the god created the sun, the sky, and dawn. According to 
another hymn (RV 10.113.4-6) Indra, as soon as he was born, separated 
the Sky from the Earth, fixed the celestial vault, and hurling the vajra, 
tore apart V tra, who was holding the waters captive in the darkness. 

Now, Sky and Earth are the parents of the gods (1.185.6); Indra is the 
youngest (3.38.1) and also the last god to be born, because he put an end 
to the hierogamy [mystical union] of Sky and Earth: “By his strength, he 
spread out these two worlds, Sky and Earth, and caused the sun to shine.” 

(8.3.6). After this demiurgic feat, Indra appointed Vara a cosmocrator 
and guardian of ta (which had remained concealed in the world below; 
1.62.1).... 

There are other types of Indian cosmogonies that explain the creation 
of the world from a materia prima. This is not the case with the myth we 
have just summarized, for here a certain type of “world” already existed. 

For Sky and Earth were formed and had engendered the gods. Indra only 
separated the cosmic parents, and, by hurling the vajra at V tra, he put an 
end to the immobility, or even the “virtuality,” symbolized by the 
dragon’s mode of being. [Indra comes across V tra “not divided, not 
awake, plunged in the deepest sleep, stretched out” (RV 4.19.3).] 
According to certain traditions, the “fashioner” of the gods, Tva , 
whose role is not clear in the Rig Veda, had built himself a house and 
created V tra as a sort of roof, but also as walls, for his habitation. Inside 
this dwelling, encircled by V tra, Sky, Earth and the Waters existed. 

Indra bursts asunder this primordial monad by breaking the “resistance” 
and inertia of V tra. In other words, the world and life could not come to 
birth except by the slaying of an amorphous Being. In countless variants, 
this myth is quite widespread. 273 

The primordial theriomorphic serpent-god is endless potential, is whatever being is prior 
to the emergence of the capacity for experience. This potential has been represented as 
the self-devouring dragon (most commonly) because this image (portrayed in Figure 29: 
The Urohoros—Precosmogonic Dragon of Chaos 214 aptly symbolizes the union of 
incommensurate opposites. The uroboros is simultaneously representative of two 
antithetical primordial ele-

ments. As a snake, the uroboros is a creature of the ground, of matter, as a bird (a winged 
animal), it is a creature of the air, the sky, spirit. The uroboros symbolizes the union of 
known (associated with spirit) and unknown (associated with matter), explored and 
unexplored; symbolizes the juxtaposition of the “masculine” principles of security, 
tyranny and order with the “feminine” principles of darkness, dissolution, creativity and 
chaos. Furthermore, as a snake, the uroboros has the capacity to shed its skin—to be 
“reborn.” Thus, it also represents the possibility of transformation, and stands for the 
knower, who can transform chaos into order, and order into chaos. The uroboros stands 
for, or comprises, everything that is as of yet unencountered, prior to its differentiation as 
a consequence of active exploration and classification. It is the source of all the 
information that makes up the determinate world of experience and is, simultaneously, 
the birthplace of the experiencing subject. 

The uroboros is one thing, as everything that has not yet been explored is one thing; it 
exists everywhere, and at all times. It is completely self-contained, completely self- 
referential: it feeds, fertilizes and engulfs itself. It unites the beginning and the end, being 
and becoming, in the endless circle of its existence. It serves as symbol for the ground of 
reality itself. It is the “set of all things that are not yet things,” the primal origin and 
ultimate point of return for every discriminable object and every independent subject. It 
serves as progenitor of all we know, all that we don’t know, and of the spirit that 
constitutes our capacity to know and not know. It is the mystery that constantly emerges

when solutions to old problems cause new problems; is the sea of chaos surrounding 
man’s island of knowledge—and the source of that knowledge, as well. It is all new 
experience generated by time, which incessantly works to transform the temporarily 
predictable once again into the unknown. It has served mankind as the most ubiquitous 
and potent of primordial gods: 

This is the ancient Egyptian symbol of which it is said, “Draco interfecit 
se ipsum, maritat se ipsum, impraegnat se ipsum ." It slays, weds, and 
impregnates itself. It is man and woman, begetting and conceiving, 
devouring and giving birth, active and passive, above and below, at once. 

As the Heavenly Serpent, the uroboros was known in ancient Babylon; 
in later times, in the same area, it was often depicted by the Mandaeans; 
its origin is ascribed by Macrobius to the Phoenicians. It is the archetype 
of the Cvtokov, the All One, appearing as Leviathan and as Aion, as 
Oceanus, and also as the Primal Being that says “I am Alpha and Omega.” 

As the Kneph of antiquity it is the Primal Snake, the “most ancient deity 
of the prehistoric world.” The uroboros can be traced in the Revelation of 
St. John and among the Gnostics as well as among the Roman syncretists; 
there are pictures of it in the sand paintings of the Navajo Indians and in 
Giotto; it is found in Egypt, Africa, Mexico, and India, among the gypsies 
as an amulet, and in the alchemical texts. 275 

The uroboros is Tiamat, the dragon who inhabits the deep, transformed by Marduk into 
the world; Apophis, the serpent who nightly devours the sun; and Rahab, the leviathan, 
slain by Yahweh in the course of the creation of the cosmos: 

Canst thou draw out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord 
which thou lettest down? 

Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw through with a 
thorn? 

Will he make many supplications unto thee? will he speak soft words unto 
thee? 

Will he make a covenant with thee? wilt thou take him for a servant for 
ever? 

Wilt thou play with him as with a bird? or wilt thou bind him for thy 
maidens? 

Shall the companions make a banquet of him? shall they part him among 
the merchants? 

Canst thou fill his skin with barbed irons? or his head with fish spears? 

Lay thine hand upon him, remember the battle, do no more. 

Behold, the hope of him is in vain: shall not one be cast down even at the 
sight of him? 

None is so fierce that dare stir him up: who then is able to stand before 
me? 

Who hath prevented me, that I should repay him? whatsoever is under the 
whole heaven is mine.

Who can open the doors of his face? his teeth are terrible round about. 

His scales are his pride, shut up together as with a close seal. 

One is so near to another, that no air can come between them. 

They are joined one to another, they stick together, that they cannot be 
sundered. 

By his neesings a light doth shine, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the 
morning. 

Out of his mouth go burning lamps, and sparks of fire leap out. 

Out of his nostrils goeth smoke, as out of a seething pot or caldron. 

His breath kindleth coals, and a flame goeth out of his mouth. 

In his neck remaineth strength, and sorrow is turned into joy before him. 

The flakes of his flesh are joined together: they are firm in themselves; 
they cannot be moved. 

His heart is as firm as a stone; yea, as hard as a piece of the nether 
millstone. 

When he raiseth up himself, the mighty are afraid: by reason of breakings 
they purify themselves. 

The sword of him that layeth at him cannot hold: the spear, the dart, nor 
the habergeon. 

He esteemeth iron as straw, and brass as rotten wood. 

The arrow cannot make him flee: slingstones are turned with him into 
stubble. 

Darts are counted as stubble: he laugheth at the shaking of a spear. 

Sharp stones are under him: he spreadeth sharp pointed things upon the 
mire. 

He maketh the deep to boil like a pot: he maketh the sea like a pot of 
ointment. 

He maketh a path to shine after him; one would think the deep to be 
hoary. 

Upon earth there is not his like, who is made without fear. 

He beholdeth all high things: he is a king over all the children of pride. 

(Job 41:1-34) 

The uroboros is that which exists as pure unqualified potential, prior to the manifestation 
of such potential, in the experience of the limited subject; is the infinite possibility for 
sudden dramatic unpredictability that still resides in the most thoroughly explored and 
familiar of objects (things, other people, ourselves). That unpredictability is not mere 
material possibility or potential; it is also meaning. The domain of chaos—which is 
where what to do has not yet been specified—is a “place” characterized by the presence 
of potent emotions, discouragement, depression, fear, rootlessness, loss and 
disorientation. It is the affective aspect of chaos that constitutes what is most clearly 
known about chaos. It is “darkness, drought, the suspension of norms, and death.” 276 It is 
the terror of the dark of night, which fills itself with demons of the imagination, yet exerts 



Maps of meaning 144 


an uncanny fascination; it is the fire that magically reduces one determinate thing to 
another; it is the horror and curiosity engendered by the stranger and foreigner. 

The uroboros—the primordial matrix—contains in “embryonic” form everything that 
can in principle possibly be experienced, and the thing that does the experiencing. The 
great serpent (the matrix) is therefore consciousness— spirit, before it manifests itself— 
and matter, before it is separated from spirit. This great mythological idea finds its echo 
in certain modern theories of the development of the subject; most particularly, among 
those entitled constructivist. The famous Swiss developmental psychologist Jean Piaget 
claimed, for example, that the experiencing subject constructs himself in infancy, as a 
consequence of his exploratory activity. 277 He acts, and observes himself acting; then 
imitates the action, forming a primordial representation of himself—later, formulates a 
more abstracted model of his own actions. Thus the subject is created from the 
information generated in the course of exploratory activity. Contemporaneously, the 
world comes into being: 

Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to be meat 
to the people inhabiting the wilderness. 

Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou driedst up mighty 
rivers. 

The day is thine, the night also is thine: thou has prepared the light and the 
sun. 

Thou hast set all the borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and 
winter. (Psalms 74:14—17). 

Actions have consequences. The consequences of actions constitute the world—the 
familiar world, when they are predictable; the world of the unexpected, when they are 
not. 

The state of the origin has been represented most abstractly as a circle, the most 
perfect of geometric forms, or as a sphere, without beginning or end, symmetrical across 
all axes. Plato, in the Timaeus, described the primary source as the round, there at the 
beginning. 278 In the Orient, the world and its meaning springs from the encircled interplay 
and union of the light, spiritual, masculine yang and the dark, material, feminine yin. 219 
According to the adepts of medieval alchemy, discernible objects of experience (and the 
subjects who experienced them) emerged from the round chaos, which was a spherical 
container of the primordial element. 280 The God of Islam, Judaism and Christianity, 
“Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end, the first and the last” (Revelations 22:13), 
places himself outside of or beyond worldly change, and unites the temporal opposites 
within the great circle of his being. The assimilation of the origin to a circle finds 
narrative echo in myths describing heaven as the end to which life is, or should be, 
devoted (at least from the perspective of the “immortal soul.”) The Kingdom of God, 
promised by Christ, is in fact re-establishment of Paradise (although a Paradise 
characterized by reconciliation of opposing forces, and not regressive dissolution into 
preconscious unity). Such re-establishment closes the circle of temporal being. 

The uroboric initial state is the “place” where all opposite things were (will be) united; 
the great self-devouring dragon whose division into constituent elements constitutes the 
precondition for experience itself. This initial state is a “place” free of problems, and has 



Maps of Meaning 145 


a paradisal aspect, in consequence; however, the price that must be paid for uroboric 
paradise is being itself. It is not until the original unity of all things is broken up—until 
the most primordial of gods is murdered—that existence itself springs into being. The 
emergence of things, however, brings with it the problem of conflict—a problem that 
must be solved, optimally, without eliminating the fact of existence itself. 

The uroboros is the unified parent of the known, the Great Father (explored territory 
and the familiar), and of the unknown, the Great Mother (anomalous information and the

unpredictable). It might be regarded, as well, as the single androgynous grandparent of 
the hero, son of the night and the day, mediator between the known and unknown, whose 
being constitutes a necessary precondition for the existence of differentiated things (and 
who can, therefore, also be regarded as a causa prima). The world parents, Earth and 
Sky, emerge when the uroboric dragon undergoes a first division. Figure 30: The Birth 
of the World Parents presents the “birth of the world” in schematic form, insofar as it has 
been conceptualized by the mythic imagination. The chaos that constitues totality divides 
itself into what has been explored, and what has yet to be explored. 

From the mythic perspective, this division is equivalent to the emergence of the 
cosmos—and, therefore, to creation or genesis itself. One thing is missing—the fact of 
the explorer, and the nature of his relationship with what is known and what has yet to be 
known. With the “birth” of the explorer—with his construction from the interplay 
between culture and nature—the entire “world” comes into being. This “emergence of 
experience” is portrayed in Figure 31: The Constituent Elements of the World, in 
Dynamic Relationship. The “knower” is simultaneously child of nature and culture. 




Maps of meaning 146 


creator of culture (as a consequence of his encounter with nature or the unknown world) 
and the “person” for whom the unknown is a reality. 

It is almost impossible to overestimate the degree to which the “world parent” schema 
of 



Figure 31: The Constituent Elements of the World, in 
Dynamic Relationship 

categorization colors (or, alternatively, has been derived from) fundamental human 
presumption and activity. The “world” is explored territory, surrounded by mystery; that 
mystery is experienced as undifferentiated but oft-menacing chaos. Everything that 
“occupies” such chaos is directly perceived as (not abstractly conceptualized as) identical 
to it—is directly perceived as unknown and anxiety-provoking. The foreigner, 
therefore—the occupant of the “habitation of dragons” (Isaiah 34:13)—is naturally 
apprehended as an agent of formless chaos. Eliade states: 

One of the outstanding characteristics of traditional societies is the 
opposition that they assume between their inhabited world and the 
unknown and indeterminate space that surrounds it. The former is the 
world (more precisely, our world), the cosmos; everything outside it is no 
longer a cosmos but a sort of “other world,” a foreign, chaotic space, 
peopled by ghosts, demons, “foreigners” (who are assimilated to 




Maps of Meaning 147 


[undistinguished from, more accurately] the demons and the souls of the 
dead). 281 

Everything outside occupies the same categorical space as the dragon of chaos, or the 
terrible mother. The early Indo-Europeans equated the destruction of enemies in battle to 
the slaying of V tra by Indra; 282 the ancient Egyptians regarded the Hyksos, 
“barbarians,” as equivalent to Apophis, the serpent who nightly devours the sun; 28 ' and 
the archaic Iranians (Zoroastrians) equated the mythic struggle of King Faridun against a 
foreign usurper—the dragon Azdahak—with the cosmogonic fight of the hero Thraetona 
against Azhi Dahaka, the primordial serpent of chaos. 284 The enemies of the Old 
Testament Hebrews also suffer the same fate: they are regarded as equivalent to Rahab, 
or Leviathan, the serpent overcome by Yahweh in his battle to establish the world 
[“Speak, and say. Thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, I am against thee. Pharaoh king of 
Egypt, the great dragon that lieth in the midst of his rivers, which hath said, My river is 
mine own, and I have made it for myself.” (Ezekiel 29:3); also, “Nebuchadnezzar the 
king of Babylon hath devoured me, he hath crushed me, he hath made me an empty 
vessel, he hath swallowed me up like a dragon, he hath filled his belly with my delicates, 
he hath cast me out.” (Jeremiah 51:34)]. Eliade continues: 

At first sight this cleavage in space appears to be due to the opposition 
between an inhabited and organized—hence cosmicized—territory and 
the unknown space that extends beyond its frontiers; on one side there is a 
cosmos, on the other a chaos. But we shall see that if every inhabited 
territory is a cosmos, this is precisely because it was first consecrated, 
because, in one way or another, it is the work of the gods or is in 
communication with the world of the gods. The world (that is, our world) 
is a universe within which the sacred has already manifested itself, in 
which, consequently, the break-through from plane to plane has become 
possible and repeatable. It is not difficult to see why the religious moment 
implies the cosmogonic moment. The sacred reveals absolute reality and 
at the same time makes orientation possible; hence it founds the world in 
the sense that it fixes the limits and establishes the order of the world. 

All this appears very clearly from the Vedic ritual for taking possession 
of a territory; possession becomes legally valid through the erection of a 
fire altar consecrated to Agni. “One says that one is installed when one 
has built a fire altar (garhapatya) and all those who build the fire altar are 
legally established.” (Sliatapatha Brahmana, VII, 1,1,1-4). By the 
erection of a fire altar Agni is made present, and communication with the 
world of the gods is ensured; the space of the altar becomes a sacred 
space. But the meaning of the ritual is far more complex, and if we 
consider all of its ramifications, we shall understand why consecrating a 
territory is equivalent to making it a cosmos, to cosmicizing it. For, in fact, 
the erection of an altar to Agni is nothing but the reproduction—on the 
microcosmic scale—of the Creation. The water in which the clay is mixed 
is assimilated to the primordial water; the clay that forms the base of the 
altar symbolizes the earth; the lateral walls represent the atmosphere, and 



Maps of meaning 148 


so on. And the building of the altar is accompanied by songs that proclaim 
which cosmic region has just been created (Shatapatha Brahmana I, 9, 2, 

29, etc.). Hence the erection of a fire altar—which alone validates taking 
possession of a new territory—is equivalent to a cosmogony. 

An unknown, foreign and unoccupied territory (which often means 
“unoccupied by our people”) still shares in the fluid and larval modality of 
chaos. By occupying it and, above all, by settling in it, man symbolically 
transforms it into a cosmos through a ritual repetition of the cosmogony. 

What is to become “our world” must first be “created,” and every creation 
has a paradigmatic model—the creation of the universe by the gods. When 
the Scandinavian colonists took possession of Iceland (landnama) and 
cleared it, they regarded the enterprise neither as an original undertaking 
nor as human and profane work. For them, their labor was only repetition 
of a primordial act, the transformation of chaos into cosmos by the divine 
act of creation. When they tilled the desert soil, they were in fact repeating 
the act of the gods who had organized chaos by giving it a structure, 
forms, and norms. 

Whether it is a case of clearing uncultivated ground or of conquering 
and occupying a territory already inhabited by “other” human beings, 
ritual taking possession must always repeat the cosmogony. For in the 
view of archaic societies everything that is not “our world” is not yet a 
world. A territory can be made ours only by creating it anew, that is, by 
consecrating it. This religious behavior in respect to unknown lands 
continued, even in the West, down to the dawn of modern times [and was 
reflected recently in the “planting of the flag” on the moon, by the 
American astronauts]. The Spanish and Portuguese conquistadors, 
discovering and conquering territories, took possession of them in the 
name of Jesus Christ [the world-creating Logo.s\. 2: " 

A similar form of ritual and ideation dominates processes even as “simple” as the 

establishment of a new building. In India, 

Before a single stone is laid, “The astrologer shows what spot in the 
foundation is exactly above the head of the snake that supports the world. 

The mason fashions a little wooden peg from the wood of the Khadira 
tree, and with a coconut drives the peg into the ground at this particular 
spot, in such a way as to peg the head of the snake securely down.... If 
this snake should ever shake its head really violently, it would shake the 
world to pieces.” 286 A foundation stone is placed above the peg. The 
cornerstone is thus situated exactly at the “center of the world.” But the 
act of foundation at the same time repeats the cosmogonic act, for to 
“secure” the snake’s head, to drive the peg into it, is to imitate the 
primordial gesture of Soma (Rig Veda II, 12, 1) or of Indra when the latter 
“smote the Serpent in his lair” (Rig Veda, VI, 17, 9), when his thunderbolt 
“cut off his head” (Rig Veda I, 52, 10). 287

Order—explored territory—is constructed out of chaos and exists, simultaneously, in 
opposition to that chaos (to the “new” chaos, more accurately: to the unknown now 
defined in opposition to explored territory). Everything that is not order—that is, not 
predictable, not usable—is, by default (by definition) chaos. The foreigner—whose 
behaviors cannot be predicted, who is not kin, either by blood or by custom, who is not 
an inhabitant of the “cosmos,” whose existence and domain has not been sacralized—is 
equivalent to chaos (and not merely metaphorically equated with chaos). As such, his 
appearance means threat, as his action patterns and beliefs have the capacity to upset 
society itself, to dissolve and flood the world, and to reinstitute the dominion of the 
uroboros. 


The Great Mother: Images of the Unknown, or Unexplored Territory 

The Mother of Songs, the mother of our whole seed, bore us in the 
beginning. She is the mother of all races of men and the mother of all 
tribes. She is the mother of the thunder, the mother of the rivers, the 
mother of trees and of all kinds of things. She is the mother of songs 
and dances. She is the mother of the older brother stones. She is the 
mother of the grain and the mother of all things. She is the mother of 
the younger brother Frenchmen and of the strangers. She is the 
mother of the dance paraphernalia and of all temples, and the only 
mother we have. She is the mother of the animals, the only one, and 
the mother of the Milky Way. It was the mother herself who began to 
baptize. She gave us the limestone coca dish. She is the mother of the 
rain, the only one we have. She alone is the mother of all things, she 
alone. And the mother has left a memory in all the temples. With her 
sons, the saviors, she left songs and dances as a reminder. Thus the 
priests, the fathers, and the older brothers have reported/ 88 


Representation of culture, the known, is simple, comparatively; it is second-order 
abstraction, depiction of that which has already been made subject to order. 
Representation of culture is encapsulation of that to which behavioral adaptation has 
previously occurred; of those things or situations whose sensory properties, affective 
implications and motivational significances have been and are presently specified. 
Representation of the knower, the human subject, is also depiction of that which is 
constantly encountered, in all interpersonal interactions, and in all self-conscious states: 
is portrayal of those aspects of an infinitely complex set of data which have at least been 
experienced, if not exhausted. Representation of the unknown, however, appears 
impossible, a contradiction in terms. How can what has not yet been encountered be 
comprehended, understood, embodied, faced or adapted to? But what has not been 
encountered must be comprehended. The range of our experience continually supersedes 
the domain of our determinate knowledge. We are therefore prone to constant contact 
with the unknown. It appears every time we make an error; every time our presumptions 
are wrong—every time our behaviors do not produce the consequences we expect and 
desire. The absence of specific depiction, appropriate to inexplicable circumstance, does 
not alleviate the necessity of appropriate action—even though the nature of that action 



Maps of meaning 150 


cannot yet be specified. This means that the nature of the unknown, as such, must become 
represented, in order to design action patterns, which are broadly suited for response to 
what cannot yet (and cannot eternally) be predicted or controlled. We are in fact capable 
of a set of paradoxical abilities: we know what to do, when we do not know what to do; 
we know how to represent what to do, when we do not know what to do; finally, we 
know how to represent what we have not yet encountered. These adaptive capacities— 
impossible, at first glance—immensely further our capacity to behave, successfully, in 
the face of our mysterious experience, and to communicate and broaden that capacity. 

If an error in judgment, interpretation or behavior occurs, and something unexpected 
appears, that unexpected thing has identifiable properties: it is dangerous, and promising. 
The danger is potential for punishment, frustration, disappointment, social isolation, 
physical damage—even death. Every moment of threat, however, is simultaneously a 
moment of opportunity. The change that upsets the presently predictable and orderly also 
means potential for advancement into a more promising future. The unexpected is 
information itself, information necessary for the constant expansion of adaptive 
competence. Such information comes packaged in danger and promise. To gain the 
information promised, the danger must be overcome. This process of necessary eternal 
overcoming constantly constructs and transforms our behavioral repertoires and 
representational schemas. 

Everything presently known about the subject and objects of human experience was at 
one time merely the undifferentiated unknown—which was far more than what yet 
remained to be discovered about the collectively apprehensible sensory qualities of the 
world. The unknown may manifest itself in the consensually validatable empirical realm, 
as an aspect of the material world; likewise, it may appear as new significance, where 
none was evident before. What is known and familiar poses no threat, but offers no 
possibility beyond that which has been previously determined. The explored thing or 
situation has been associated with behaviors that render it beneficial, in the ideal, or at 
least irrelevant. The omnipresent unknown, by contrast, presents threat and promise 
infinite in scope, impossible to encapsulate, equally impossible to ignore. The unknown, 
unexpected, or unpredictable is the source of all conditional knowledge—and the place 
that such knowledge “returns” to, so to speak, when it is no longer useful. Everything we 
know, we know because someone explored something they did not understand—explored 
something they were afraid of, in awe of. Everything we know, we know because 
someone generated something valuable in the course of an encounter with the 
unexpected. 

“Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can 
perform without thinking about them.” 289 All things that we know no longer demand our 
attention. To know something is to do it automatically, without thinking, to categorize it 
at a glance (or less than a glance), or to ignore it entirely. The nervous system is 
“designed” to eliminate predictability from consideration, and to focus limited analytical 
resources where focus would produce useful results. We attend to the places where 
change is occurring; where something is happening that has not yet been modeled, where 
something is happening that has not yet had behaviors erected around it—where 
something is happening that is not yet understood. Consciousness itself might be 
considered as that organ which specializes in the analysis and classification of 
unpredictable events. Attention and concentration naturally gravitate to those elements in 



Maps of Meaning 151 


the experiential field that contain the highest concentration of novelty, or that are the least 
expected, prior to what might normally be considered higher cognitive processing. The 
nervous system responds to irregular change and eliminates regularity. There is limited 
information, positive and negative, in the predictable. The novel occurrence, by contrast, 
might be considered a window into the “transcendent space” where reward and 
punishment exist in eternal and unlimited potential. 

The unknown or unexpected or novel appears when plans go wrong: when behavioral 
adaptation or interpretive schema fails to produce what is desired or to predict what 
occurs. The appearance of the unexpected or unpredictable inhibits ongoing goal-directed 
activity in the absence of conscious volition. Concurrently with this inhibition of activity 
comes inex-orable redirection of attention toward the unexpected event. The unexpected 
grips behavior and spontaneously generates antithetical affects, varying in intensity with 
the improbability of the occurrence, creating heightened interest, fear, intense curiosity or 
outright terror. This motivational significance appears to have been experienced as an 
intrinsic feature of the unknown, prior to the strict formal modern division of experiential 
world into empirical object and subjective observer—and is still fundamentally 
experienced in that manner today. Rudolf Otto, in his seminal investigation into the 
nature of religious experience, described such experience as numinous' 90 involuntarily 
gripping, indicative of significance beyond the normal and average. The “numinous” 
experience has two aspects: mysterium tremendum, which is capacity to invoke trembling 
and fear; and mysterium fascinans, capacity to powerfully attract, fascinate and compel. 
This numinous power, divine import, is extreme affective relevance and concomitant 
direction of behavior by the (unknown) object. This “power” is commonly considered by 
those subject to it as a manifestation of God, personification of the unknown, and 
ultimate source of all conditional knowledge: 

The feeling of it may at times come sweeping like a gentle tide, pervading 
the mind with a tranquil mood of deepest worship. It may pass over into a 
more set and lasting attitude of the soul, continuing, as it were, thrillingly 
vibrant and resonant, until at last it dies away and the soul resumes its 
“profane,” non-religious mood of everyday experience. It may burst in 
sudden eruptions up from the depths of the soul with spasms and 
convulsions, or lead to the strangest excitements, to intoxicated frenzy, to 
transport, and to ecstasy. It has its wild and demonic forms and can sink to 
an almost grisly horror and shuddering. It has its crude, barbaric 
antecedents and early manifestations, and again it may be developed into 
something beautiful and pure and glorious. It may become the hushed, 
trembling, and speechless humility of the creature in the presence of-— 
whom or what? In the presence of that which is a mystery inexpressible 
and above all creatures. 291 

Nothing that is not represented can be said to be understood—not as we normally use that 
term. Nonetheless, understanding of the unknown—which cannot, in theory, be 
represented—is vital to continued survival. Desire to represent the unknown, to capture 
its essence, is in consequence potent enough to drive the construction of culture, the net 
that constrains the unknowable source of all things. The impetus for representation of the 



Maps of meaning 152 


domain of the unexpected arose (and arises) as consequence of the intrinsic, biologically 
determined affective or emotional significance of the unknown or novel world. 
Representations of the unknown constitute attempts to elaborate upon its nature, to 
illuminate its emotional and motivational significance (to illuminate its being, from the 
prescientific or mythic perspective). This is categorization of all that has not yet been 
explored and represented, in the service of adaptation to that which has not yet been 
understood. This is the attempt to formulate a conception of “the category of all as-of-yet 
uncategorized things,” so that a useful stance might be adopted, with regard to that 
category. 

The novel ceaselessly inspires thought and allows itself to be entangled, yet inevitably 
transcends all attempts at final classification. The unknown therefore provides a constant 
powerful source of “energy” for exploration and the generation of new information. 
Desire to formulate a representation of that which supersedes final classification and 
remains eternally motivating might well be understood as a prepotent and irresistible 
drive. That drive constitutes what might be regarded as the most fundamental religious 
impulse—constitutes the culturally universal attempt to define and establish a 
relationship with God—and underlies the establishment of civilized historical order. The 
product of this drive, the culturally constructed complex, extant in fantasy—the symbol, 
composed of communicable representation of all things constantly threatening and 
promising to man—affects and structures the experience of each individual, yet remains 
impersonal, distinct and separate: 

The living symbol formulates an essential unconscious factor, and the 
more widespread this factor is, the more general is the effect of the 
symbol, for it touches a corresponding chord in every psyche. Since, for a 
given epoch, it is the best possible expression for what is still unknown, it 
must be the product of the most complex and differentiated minds of that 
age. But in order to have an effect at all, it must embrace what is common 
to a large group of men. This can never be what is most differentiated, the 
highest attainable, for only a very few attain to that or understand it. The 
common factor must be something that is still so primitive that its 
ubiquity cannot be doubted. Only when the symbol embraces that and 
expresses it in the highest possible form is it of general efficacy. Herein 
lies the potency of the living, social symbol and its redeeming power. 292 

This dynamic representation might form part of the subjective experience of a myriad of 
people, and therefore have its “own” biologically grounded, culturally determined 
existence, independent of any given person at any given time—even to follow its own 
intrinsic rules of development—yet fail to exist “objectively” as the objective is currently 
understood. 

Ritualized, dramatic or mythic representations of the unknown—the domain that 
emerges when error is committed—appear to have provided the initial material for the 
most primordial and fundamental aspects of formalized religions. Appreciation of the 
nature of the unknown as a category developed as a consequence of observation of our 
inherent response to what we did not expect, manifested as predictable pattern of affect 
and behavior: fear and curiosity, terror and hope, inhibition of ongoing activity and 



Maps of Meaning 153 


cautious exploration, “habituation” and generation of novel and situation-specific 
appropriate behavioral strategies. Two things are the same, from the empirical viewpoint, 
if they share collectively apprehended sensory features. Two things are the same, from 
the metaphoric, dramatic, or mythical perspective—from the perspective of the natural 
category—if they produce the same subjective state of being (affect or motivation), or 
have the same functional status (which is implication for behavior). Experiences that 
share affective tone appear categorizable in single complexes, symbolic in nature (from 
the standpoint of abstract cognition)—appear as products of culture, which evolved in the 
social environment characteristic of ancestral Homo sapiens and later disappeared. Such 
complexes might play a useful role, in the promotion of general adaptive behavior, in the 
face of feared and promising objects, in the absence of detailed exploration-generated 
information, regarding the explicit nature of these objects. 

These representations might be considered the consequence of first-level 
representation—of imitation, as Piaget pointed out—and then, later, the consequence of 
more abstracted second-order representation (of symbolic understanding). Understanding 
can be reached at the most inclusive, yet primary level, through ritual and mimesis. An 
unknown phenomenon, gripping but incomprehensible, can yet be represented ritually, 
can be acted out. Secondary representation of this “acting out” constitutes the initial form 
of abstract representation. To understand the lion, for example—or the hunted beast—it is 
first necessary to “become” the lion or the hunted beast—to mimic, physically, and later 
to represent the mimicry in imagination. It is in this manner that the son imitates the 
father, whom he will later become. A child’s embodiment of the parent means his 
incorporation of the knowledge of the parent, at least insofar as that knowledge is action. 
The child acts out his father, without understanding him and without understanding the 
reasons for his acting out. It could be said, metaphorically, that the imitating child is 
possessed by the spirit of the father, as the father was possessed in his own childhood. 
The “spirit of the father” may be conceived, in this representational schema, as an entity 
independent of the particular father, or the particular son—as something that manifests 
itself in imagination and in possession of behavior generation after generation, in more or 
less constant and traditional form. Similarly, the unknown, which might be considered 
object and subject simultaneously—which manifests itself in the perceptible world, in 
affect, and which grips behavior—might well be regarded as (or manifest itself in 
imagination as) a transpersonal entity (or as the result of the actions of a transpersonal 
entity). The ancestral “primordial hunter,” terrified by something unknown in the bush, 
portrays his encounter with what frightened him by acting out the unknown demon when 
he returns to the village. This acting out is simultaneously embodiment and 
representation; it is basic-level hypothesis regarding the nature of the unknown, as such. 
Alternatively, perhaps, he fashions an image, an idol, of the thing—and gives concrete 
form to what until then is merely behavioral compulsion. The unknown first appears 
symbolically as an independent personality, when it cannot be conceived of in any other 
fashion, and later appears as if it were a personality (in evidently metaphoric guise). 
Evidence for the adoption of “personality” by representational or quasi-representational 
“complexes” is plentiful. 293 Such “complexes” may “construct themselves” over the 
course of many centuries, as a consequence of the exploratory and creative endeavors of 
many disparate individuals, united within the communicative network of culture.

It is in this manner, over vast stretches of time, that the “transpersonal” domain of the 
imagination becomes populated with “spirits.” Jung described the “space” occupied by 
such “spirits” as the pleroma (a gnostic term). 294 The pleroma might be described as the 
subjective world of experience, in remembrance—the episodic world, perhaps, from the 
perspective of modern memory theory—although representations apparently collectively 
apprehensible under certain peculiar circumstances (like those of the Virgin Mary, in 
Yugoslavia, prior to the devastating Serbian-Bosnian-Muslim war, or those of “alien 
spaceships” [UFOs] during the Cold War) also make their “home” there. The pleroma is 
the “space” in which heaven and hell have their existence, the place where Plato’s 
“supracelestial” ideals reside, the ground of dream and fantasy. It appears to have a four¬ 
dimensional structure, like that of objective space-time (and of memory), 295 but is 
characterized by a tremendous vagueness with regards to category and temporality. The 
“spirits” which inhabit the pleroma, in its “natural” condition, are deities — 
undifferentiated mixes of subject and object, motivational significance and sensory 
aspect, elaborated into personified representations by the efforts of many. This is merely 
to say that a representation is a social construct, with historical (even biological) roots — 
like any idea—and that the spirit who inhabits the imagination is not necessarily a 
figment created by the person who “has” that imagination. The devil is not the product of 
the particular Christian. It is more accurate to note that the figure of the devil—or of 
Christ, for that matter—inhabits the mind of the Christian (and of all Christians), and that 
such habitation occurs as a consequence of transpersonal social and historical processes 
operating almost completely beyond the realm of individual control. 296 The child, 
similarly, cannot be said to create the monsters that live in his imagination. They grow 
there, so to speak, and are then subjectively observed—are fed by casual statements on 
the part of adults, by action patterns the child observes but cannot explain, by emotions 
and motivational states that emerge suddenly and unpredictably, by the fantasies in 
books, on TV and in the theater. 

Events or experiences that remain beyond the reach of exploration, assimilation and 
accommodation stay firmly entrenched in or automatically ascribed to the domain of the 
unknown, threatening and promising. The category of all events that cannot yet be 
categorized can nonetheless be modeled, through metaphoric application of partially 
comprehensible yet affect-inducing occurrences whose emotional relevance in some way 
matches that of the unknown. Each of the specific things that signifies danger, for 
example—or, alternatively, the enhancement of life—appears easily associated with 
every other specific thing, characterized by the same property, as well as with novelty 
itself, which produces fear and hope as part of its (subjectively) intrinsic nature. These 
experiences appear interassociated on the basis of the similar affective or behavioral 
states they inspire—the motivational effects they engender, prior to development of 
“habituation” in course of exploratory behavior. 297 The archaic “limbic system” has its 
own method of classification, so to speak, experienced privately as emotion—or as 
behavior spontaneously undertaken—manifested outside the realm of conditional abstract 
culturally determined presumption. 298 Everything novel encountered, avoided because of 
involuntary or willfully manifested fear or ignorance, is potentially or actively linked 
with all that remains outside of individual competence and/or cultural classification. 
Everything that produces fear may be subjectively considered one aspect of the same 
(subterranean) thing. What is that thing?

The unknown, as such, surrounds all things, but exists only in a hypothetical state, and 
finds representation in symbolic form as the uroboros, as we have seen. The 
disintegration or division of the uroboros gives rise to all things, including the disorder or 
unpredictability that is defined in opposition to what has been explored. This more 
narrowly defined domain of disorder or unpredictability—which is the unknown as it is 
actually experienced (rather than as a hypothetical entity)—tends to be portrayed as 
something distinctly feminine, as the daughter of the great serpent, as the matrix of all 
determinate being. It is useful to regard the Great 



Figure 32: Novelty, the Great Mother, as Daughter of 
the Uroboros 

Mother as the primary agent of the serpent of chaos—as the serpent’s representative, so 
to speak, in the profane domain. The serpent of chaos can be seen lurking “behind” the 
Great Mother, as we shall see, and she often “adopts” reptilian (material) or birdlike 
(spiritual) features. This relationship is schematically represented in Figure 32: Novelty, 
the Great Mother, 299 as Daughter of the Uroboros. In the incarnation depicted, the Great 
Mother is Venus, goddess of fertility and love. As the winged mother—bird and matter— 
she is “spirit” and “earth” at once; the wings might just as easily be replaced by the icon 
of a snake, which would tie her figure more closely to the earth (and to the idea of 
transformation). The capsule that surrounds her, for example—frequently found 





Maps of meaning 156 


enveloping Christ (as son of the Divine Mother) or Mary (the Divine Mother herself) in 
late medieval and early Renaissance art—is the mandorla, or vesica pisces, the “fishes’ 
bladder,” which appears to have served as sexual/symbolic representation of the source of 
all things since well before written history began.’ 00 

The uroboros and the figure of the Great Mother commonly overlap because the 
“chaos comprising the original state” is hard to distinguish from the “chaos defined in 
opposition to established order.” Two things that have no distinguishable features (as is 
the case for the “two domains of chaos”) are difficult to separate from one another. The 
distinctions between the figures of the uroboros and the Great Mother are just as 
important as their similarities, however. An immense difference obtains between the 
possibility of something unknown and an actual unknown (the difference between 
potential and reality). Eliade provides an example of a careful attempt to disentangle the 
categories, drawn from Lao-Tzu: 

In another cosmogonic fragment (chap. 25), the Tao is denominated “an 
undifferentiated and perfect being, born before Heaven and Earth.... We 
can consider it the Mother of this world, but I do not know its name; I will 
call it Tao; and if it must be named, its name will be: the Immense (ta)." 

The “undifferentiated and perfect” being is interpreted by a commentator 
of the second century B.C. thus: “the mysterious unity [Hung-t’ung] of 
Heaven and Earth chaotically [hun-tun] constitutes [the condition] of the 
uncarved block.” Hence the Tao is a primordial totality, living and 
creative but formless and nameless. “That which is nameless is the origin 
of Heaven and Earth. That which has a name is the Mother of the ten 
thousand beings.” 301 

The unknown, as such, is the thing “in and of itself.” By contrast, the unknown as 
encountered (by a determinate subject, in a particular situation) is the matrix of all 
being —the actual source of information that, once explored and categorized, constitutes 
“cosmos” or order (and, for that matter, exploring agent). 

Lao-Tzu also says, in an attempt to further clarify the situation: 

The divinity of the Valley does not die: it is the Obscure Female. The gate 
of the Obscure Female—that is the origin of Heaven and Earth. ’ 02 

The unknown appears to be generally conceptualized or symbolically represented as 
female primarily because the female genitalia—hidden, private, unexplored, 
productive—serve as “gateway” or “portal” to the “(divine) unknown world or source of 
creation,” and therefore easily come to stand for that “place.” Novelty and femininity 
share analogical or categorical identity, from this perspective: both constitute a window, 
so to speak, into the world “beyond.” Woman, insofar as she is subject to natural 
demands, is not merely a model for nature—she is divine nature, in imagination and 
actuality. She literally embodies the matrix of biological being, and provides, as such, an 
appropriate figure for the metaphoric modeling of the ground of everything. The female 
body constitutes the border between normal experience and the totality from which all 
forms emerge. Infants come from mothers; this hypothesis, based upon direct 



Maps of Meaning 157 


observation, accounts for the provisional source of particular individuals. The origin, per 
se, partakes of the same essential ineffable nature—partakes of whatever is characteristic 
of the (experienceable) mother, and other identifiable points of origin, which cannot be 
described or comprehended so easily (such as the caves where ores “grow and mature,” 
or the ground where crops thrive). The matrix of all things is something feminine, like the 
mothers of experience; it is something with an endlessly fecund and renewed (maternal 
and virginal) nature—something that defines fertility and, therefore, femininity itself. 
Things come from somewhere; all things have their birthplace. The relationship of man 
writ large to nature, eternal mother, endlessly mimics that of the particular child to his 
personal mother—or, to be more accurate, the child and the mother mimic life and the 
world. 

The unknown—as it can be encountered—is female, with paradoxical qualities. The 
Great and Terrible Mother of All Things promises endlessly; she also threatens, 
absolutely. The outcome of an encounter with the unknown—which constitutes the 
necessary precondition for the generation of new information (for generation of the 
“cosmos” and of the experiencing subject)—cannot be specified beforehand; something 
new might benefit, or destroy. Femininity shares emotional valence with novelty and 
threat, furthering the utility of the female as metaphoric grist, because of the union that 
exists within experience between creation of one thing, and destruction and 
transformation of another.' 0 ' The processes of embryogenesis itself require that blood 
change form, as the fetus thrives on the “blood” of its mother. The act of birth itself is 
traumatic, painful, dangerous and frightening, recapitulating the natural theme of 
creation, transformation and destruction. Nourishment is linked integrally with death and 
terror, even from the beginning, when the metamorphosis of blood into milk transforms 
the mother into food for the infant. Nature is feminine, in addition, because of the 
isomorphic relationship that exists between childhood dependency on maternal 
beneficience and caprice, and adult subjugation to biological reality. Human infants are 
prepared, instinctively, to establish relationship with the mother, and to respond with 
vitality to manifestation of maternal interest. Every individual’s primordial world- 
experience is experience of mother, who is the world itself, in initial developmental 
stages (insofar as the world has any motivational significance, whatsoever). (Indeed, for 
individuals who are sufficiently stunted in their psychological development, the “world” 
never evolves into anything other beyond “mother.” 304 ) Furthermore, the ontogenesis of 
the individual, and the mother-child symbiosis, is comparable to the phylogenesis of 
humanity, and the relationship of that humanity with—or its dependence upon—earth and 
sea. The archetypal infantile situation, which extends back into time, prior to the 
establishment of culture itself, is recapitulated in adulthood, with the maternal object of 
fear and respect, hope, love and gratitude abstracted into experience itself. 

The threatening aspects of the Great Mother gather metaphoric representation as 
chimeras of anxiety-producing places, animals, gestures, expressions and things. These 
elements—diverse from the objective perspective (from the standpoint of the “proper 
set”)—nonetheless unite to produce an image of the ever-present potential danger 
inherent in anything unpredictable. The Great Mother—unexplored territory—is the dark, 
the chaos of the night, the insect, ophidian and reptilian worlds, the damaged body, the 
mask of anger or terror: the entire panoply of fear-inducing experiences, commonly 
encountered (and imagined) by Homo sapiens. A dynamic complex of such objects 



Maps of meaning 158 


appears as the most subtle and exact representation of the unknown imaginable— 
something capable, simultaneously, of characterizing the active bite of the snake, the life 
of fire, the sting of the scorpion, the trap of the spider—the most suitable embodiment of 
the manifest desire of nature’s vital transformative forces, generative of death, 
dissolution, destruction and endless creation. Feared 



Figure 33: The Spontaneous Personification of 
Unexplored Territory 

experiences, grounded in the inexplicable, acquire representation in fantasy, as fear- 
producing spirits. These spirits, clothed in particular anxiety-provoking occurrences, give 
form to aspects of experience that otherwise remain inexplicable—beyond understanding, 
from the perspective of conditional adaptation, action and abstract thought, but 
impossible to ignore, from the standpoint of affect. The “personality” of such beings 
constitutes the embodiment of incomprehensible, and often intolerable, motivational 
significance—comprises representation of the ground of violent emotional experience, 
capable of inducing cognitive and behavioral possession, impossible to incorporate into 
the domain of normal, culturally established being. Figure 33: The Spontaneous 
Personification of Unexplored Territory presents one such figure, and its process of 
development, in comical form. 305 Equivalent but more serious dynamic representations of 
this type are deities, gods borne of human experience, possessed of quasi-objective 




Maps of Meaning 159 


transpersonal status—like the Word—manifestations of the unfamiliar, the other, the 
unknown and the unpredictable. 

What can now be calmly described as an archaic symbol or god from the past may 
also reasonably be considered as the manifestation of a primeval “independent” 
personality—the unified “embodiment” in ritual or imagination of some set of 
phenomena united by their affective or functional equivalence. These personalities— 
deities—have with time lost affective and conceptual relevance, as a consequence of the 
constant expansion of human adaptive capacity, and have become “broken down” into 
less complex, more determinate aspects of experience. In their original form, however, 
these “representational personalities” revealed themselves within the creative, 
compensatory experience of exceptional individuals, beset by their own 
incomprehensible (although not purely idiosyncratic) personal tragedy. Concrete 
realization of such manifestation—transformation into an artistic production or potent 
story, for example—involuntarily seized the attention of peers and inspired a sense of 
fascination and awe. Centuries-long cultural elaboration of such production gave rise to 
the elaborated “existence” of transpersonal beings, of transcendent power, who inhabited 
the “space” defined by the collective imagination of mankind, and who behaved in 
accordance with the dictates of their own irrational, myth-predicated souls. These 
“representations” served as active images, detailing to everyone what was as of yet 
explicitly unknown, only partially known; they pointed the way toward aspects of 
experience beyond the grasp of “conscious” abstract apprehension, but dangerous to 
ignore. 

It is no simple manner for the limited subject to formulate an accurate representation 
of the unlimited unknown, of nature, the ground of existence. The unknown is the matrix 
of everything, the source of all birth and the final place of rest. It hides behind our 
personal identity and our culture; it constantly threatens and engenders all that we do, 
all that we understand, and all that we are. It can never be eliminated permanently from 
consideration, since every solution merely provides the breeding place for a host of new 
problems. The unknown is Homo sapiens’ everlasting enemy and greatest friend, 
constantly challenging individual facility for adaptation and representation, constantly 
pushing men and women to greater depths and more profound heights. The unknown as 
Nature appears as paradoxical formidable overwhelming power, applied simultaneously 
in one direction and its opposite. Hunger, the will to self-preservation, drives living 
creatures to devour each other rapaciously, and the hunters have no mercy for the hunted. 
Sexuality bends the individual will inexorably and often tragically to the demand of the 
species, and existence maintains itself in endless suffering, transformation and death. Life 
generates and destroys itself in a pitiless cycle, and the individual remains constantly 
subject to forces beyond understanding or control. The desire to exist permeates all that 
lives, and expresses itself in terrible fashion, in uncontrollable impulse, in an endless 
counterpoint of fecundity and decay. The most basic, fundamental and necessary aspects 
of experience are at the same time most dangerous and unacceptable. 

Empirical (classical) “objects” are either one thing or another. Nature, by contrast— 
the great unknown—is one thing and its (affective) opposite at the same time, and in the 
same place. The novel, primeval experience was (and remains) much too complex to be 
gripped, initially, by rational understanding, as understood in the present day. Mythic 
imagination, “willing” to sacrifice discriminatory clarity for inclusive phenomenological 



Maps of meaning 160 


accuracy, provided the necessary developmental bridge. The earliest embodiments of 
nature are therefore symbolic combinations of rationally irreconcilable attributes; 
monsters, essentially feminine, who represent animal and human, creation and 
destruction, birth and cessation of experience. The analytical psychologist Erich 
Neumann, who wrote a definitive, comprehensive and useful book on the symbolism of 
the feminine, states: 

In the early phases of consciousness, the numinosity [that is, the 
emotional valence] of the archetype ...exceeds man’s power of 
representation, so much so that at first no form can be given to it. And 
when later the primordial archetype takes form in the imagination of man, 
its representations are often monstrous and inhuman. This is the phase of 
the chimerical creatures composed of different animals or of animal and 
man—the griffins, sphinxes, harpies, for example—and also of such 
monstrosities as phallic and bearded mothers. It is only when 
consciousness learns to look at phenomena from a certain distance, to 
react more subtly, to differentiate and distinguish [this is a function of 
exploration and its related abstract processes], that the mixture of symbols 
prevailing in the primordial archetype separates into the groups of 
symbols characteristic of a single archetype or of a group of related 
archetypes; in short, that they became recognizable.’ 06 

The terrible aspects of the primordial Great Mother have been represented, symbolized, 
in variety of manners, but her underlying reality and essential ideation remain 
immediately recognizable. Neumann states: 

These figures are gruesomely alike. Their sheer frightfulness makes us 
hesitate, whether they represent a skull, the head of a snake or 
hippopotamus, a face showing human likeness, or a head consisting of 
two stone knives borne by a body pieced together from parts of snakes, 
panthers, lions, crocodiles, and human beings. So great is the inhuman, 
extrahuman, and superhuman quality in this experience of dread that man 
can visualize it only through phantoms. But all this—and it should not be 
forgotten—is an image not only of the Feminine but particularly and 
specifically of the Maternal. For in a profound way life and birth are 
always bound up with death and destruction. That is why this Terrible 
Mother is “Great,” and this name is also given to Ta-Urt, the gravid 
monster, which is hippopotamus and crocodile, lioness and woman, in 
one. She too is deadly and protective. There is a frightening likeness to 
Hathor, the good cow goddess, who in the form of a hippopotamus is the 
goddess of the underworld. She has a positive aspect, and at the same time 
she is the goddess of war and death. 

In the course of the later ’ 07 development of patriarchal values, i.e., of 
the male deities of the sun and light, the negative aspect of the Feminine 
was submerged. Today it is discernible only as a content of the primordial 
age, or of the unconscious. Thus the terrible Ta-Urt, as well as the terrible 



Maps of Meaning 161 


Hathor, Isis, Neith, and others, can be reconstituted from their pictures 
that have been “painted over,” but cannot be viewed directly. Only the 
monster Am-mit or Aman, which devours the souls condemned at the 
judgment of the dead, points by its parallelism to the terrible aspect of Ta- 
Urt. Am-mit was described as follows: “Her forepart (is that of) 
crocodiles, her hinderpart (is that of) hippopotamus, and her middle (is 
that of a) lion.” The feminine, animal-mother character of this many¬ 
breasted creature is evident as is that of the monster wielding the terrible 
knife, which guards one of the underworld gates through which the souls 
of the departed must pass. 

Am-mit devours the souls that have not withstood the midnight 
judgment of the dead in the underworld. But her role has become 
subordinate, for the religion of Osiris and Horus with its mysteries has 
now promised rebirth and resurrection to all human souls, and not only, as 
originally, to the soul of Pharaoh. The certainty of magical success in 
following the path of the sun, which is communicated to each man after 
death by the priests, has overlaid the primordial fear represented by Am- 
mit. But originally she was the terrible ancestral spirit of the matriarchal 
culture, in which the Feminine takes back what has been born of it—just 
as among the primitive inhabitants of the Melanesian island of Melekula 
or in the high culture of Mexico. ' 08 

The Terrible Mother challenges and threatens the individual, absolutely. She is goddess 
of anxiety, depression and psychological chaos—goddess of the possibility of pain and 
death. She is horror, insofar as horror can be imagined, and is the ground of that horror, 
beyond. She exposes and turns to her advantage constant mortal vulnerability. She 
barters, paradoxically, offering continuance of life for sacrificial death. She demands 
reconciliation, without offering the certainty of survival. She embodies the potential for 
salvation, and the central problem of life; impels the individual, involuntarily, toward 
further expansion of consciousness, or induces involuntary contraction, leading to 
death. ' 09 The Great Mother impels—pushes (with certainty of mortality) and pulls (with 
possibility of redemption)—development of consciousness and of self-consciousness. 
The identity of death with the unknown has permanently and incurably destroyed any 
possibility of final habituation to—adaptation to, more accurately—the world of 
experience. Man is in consequence the (incurably) anxious animal: 

Thus the womb of the earth becomes the deadly devouring maw of the 
underworld, and beside the fecundated womb and the protective cave of 
earth and mountain gapes the abyss of hell, the dark hole of the depths, 
the devouring womb of the grave and death, and darkness without light, of 
nothingness. For this woman who generates life and all living things on 
earth is the same who takes them back into herself, who pursues her 
victims and captures them with snare and net. Disease, hunger, hardship, 
war above all, are her helpers, and among all peoples the goddesses of war 
and the hunt express man’s experience of life as a female exacting blood. 

This Terrible Mother is the hungry earth, which devours its own children 



Maps of meaning 162 


and fattens on their corpses; it is the tiger and the vulture, the vulture and 
the coffin, the flesh-eating sarcophagus voraciously licking up the blood 
seed of men and beasts and, once fecundated and sated, casting it out 
again in new birth, hurling it to death, and over and over again to death. ' 10 

The terrible feminine has been represented by figures such as the chimera, the sphinx, the 
griffin and the gorgon, which combined and unified the most disparate, yet related, 
aspects of nature (those aspects which, individually, intrinsically, inspire terror and 
deference). Gorgon-like figures and their “sisters” appear commonly throughout the 
world. 311 As the Aztec Coatlicue, whose gruesome headdress was composed of skulls, the 
Terrible Mother was goddess of death and dismemberment, object of sacrificial homage. 
As Goddess of the Snake, she was sacred in ancient Crete, and worshiped by the Romans. 
Her modern equivalents remain extant in Bali and India. Kali, Hindu goddess—portrayed 
in Figure 34:

She wears a tiara of skulls, has pointed, phallic breasts, and aggressive, staring eyes. A 
snake, symbol of ancient, impersonal power, transformation and rebirth, is coiled around 
her waist. She simultaneously devours, and gives birth, to a hill-grown man. Medusa, 
Greek monster, with her coif of snakes, manifests a visage so terrible that a single 
exposure turns strong men to stone—paralyzes them, permanently, with fear. This gorgon 


Maps of meaning 164 


is a late “vestigial” remnant, so to speak, of an early goddess, who simultaneously 
embodied nature’s incredible productive fecundity and callous disregard for life. 

A neuropsychological description of the brain’s response to the unexpected—such as 
we encountered earlier—is one thing; the mythological representation is another. 
Consideration of the figure of the Great and Terrible Mother is salutary; helps breed 
understanding of just what it is that our cultures—that is, our ritual identification with the 
dead—protects us from. We are shielded from the terrors of our imagination (and from 
the things that breed such terror) by the overlay of familiarity granted by shared 
frameworks of action and interpretation. These “walls” serve their purpose so well that it 
is easy for us to forget our mortal vulnerability; indeed, we generated those walls to aid 
that forgetting. But it is impossible to understand why we are so motivated to maintain 
our cultures—our beliefs, and associated patterns of action—without gazing at and 
appreciating the horrible figures generated by our ancestors. 

The Great Mother, in her negative guise, is the force that induces the child to cry in the 
absence of her parents. She is the branches that claw at the night traveler, in the depths of 
the forest. She is the terrible force that motivates the commission of atrocity—planned 
rape and painful slaughter—during the waging of war. She is aggression, without the 
inhibition of fear and guilt; sexuality in the absence of responsibility, dominance without 
compassion, greed without empathy. She is the Freudian id, unconsciousness 
contaminated with the unknown and mortal terror, and the flies in the corpse of a kitten. 
She is everything that jumps in the night, that scratches and bites, that screeches and 
howls; she is paralyzing dismay, horror and the screams that accompany madness. The 
Great Mother aborts children, and is the dead fetus; breeds pestilence, and is the plague; 
she makes of the skull something gruesomely compelling, and is all skulls herself. To 
unveil her is to risk madness, to gaze over the abyss, to lose the way, to remember the 
repressed trauma. She is the molester of children, the golem, the bogey-man, the monster 
in the swamp, the rotting cadaverous zombie who threatens the living. She is progenitor 
of the devil, the “strange son of chaos.” She is the serpent, and Eve, the temptress; she is 
the femme fatale, the insect in the ointment, the hidden cancer, the chronic sickness, the 
plague of locusts, the cause of drought, the poisoned water. She uses erotic pleasure as 
bait to keep the world alive and breeding; she is a gothic monster who feeds on the blood 
of the living. She is the water that washes menacingly over the ridge of the crumbling 
dam; the shark in the depths, the wide-eyed creature of the deep forests, the cry of the 
unknown animal, the claws of the grizzly and the smile of the criminally insane. The 
Great and Terrible Mother stars in every horror movie, every black comedy; she lies in 
wait for the purposefully ignorant like a crocodile waits in the bog. She is the mystery of 
life that can never be mastered; she grows more menacing with every retreat. 

I dreamed I saw my maternal grandmother sitting by the bank of a 
swimming pool, which was also a river. In real life, she had been a victim 
of Alzheimer’s disease and had regressed to a semi-conscious state. In the 
dream, as well, she had lost her capacity for self-control. Her genital 
region was exposed, dimly; it had the appearance of a thick mat of hair. 

She was stroking herself, absentmindedly. She walked over to me, with a 
handful of pubic hair compacted into something resembling a large 
artist’s paintbrush. She pushed this at my face. I raised my arm, several 



Maps of Meaning 165 


times, to deflect her hand; finally, unwilling to hurt her, or interfere with 
her any further, I let her have her way. She stroked my face with the 
brush, gently, and said, like a child, “Isn ’t it soft? ” I looked at her ruined 
face and said, “Yes, Grandma, it’s soft.” 

Out from behind her stepped an old white bear. It stood to her right, to 
my left. We were all beside the pool. The bear was old, like little dogs get 
old. It could not see very well, seemed miserable and behaved 
unpredictably. It started to growl and wave its head at me—-just like little 
mean dogs growl and look just before they bite you. It grabbed my left 
hand in its jaws. We both fell into the pool, which was by this time more 
like a river. I was pushing the bear away with my free hand. I yelled, 

“Dad, what should I do? ” I took an axe and hit the bear behind the head, 
hard, a number of times, killing it. It went limp in the water. I tried to lift 
its body onto the bank. Some people came to help me. I yelled, “I have to 
do this alone!” Finally I forced it out of the water. I walked away, down 
the bank. My father joined me and put his arm around my shoulder. I felt 
exhausted but satisfied. 

The unknown never disappears; it is a permanent constituent element of experience. The 
ability to represent the terrible aspects of the unknown allow us to conceptualize what has 
not yet been encountered, and to practice adopting the proper attitude toward what we do 
not understand. 

For I am the first and the last. 

I am the honored one and the scorned one. 

I am the whore and the holy one. 

I am the wife and the virgin. 313 

The positive aspect of the matrix of all being—the “twin sister” of Kali, so to speak— 
stands in marked contrast to the Terrible Mother. The beneficial unknown is the source of 
eternal plenitude and comfort. It is “positive femininity,” metaphorically speaking, that 
constitutes the ground for hope itself—for the faith and belief in the essential goodness of 
things necessary to voluntary maintenance of life and culture. The beneficial “sister” has 
in consequence acquired breadth and depth of metaphoric mythic representation 
equivalent to that of the Terrible Mother. The beneficient aspect of the matrix of all 
things—the eternally fecund “virgin” (because eternally renewed), the mother of the 
savior—is the embodiment of the helpful source, a constant aid to painful travail, tragic 
suffering and existential concern. Redemptive knowledge itself springs from the 
generative encounter with the unknown, from exploration of aspects of novel things and 
novel situations; is part of the potential of things, implicit in them, intrinsic to their 
nature. This redemptive knowledge is wisdom, knowledge of how to act, generated as a 
consequence of proper relationship established with the positive aspect of the unknown, 
the source of all things: 

Wisdom is radiant and unfading, 

and she is easily discerned by those who love her,

and is found by those who seek her. 

She hastens to make herself known to those who desire her. 

He who rises early to seek her will have no difficulty, 
for he will find her sitting at his gates. 

To fix one’s thought on her is perfect understanding, 
and he who is vigilant on her account will 
soon be free from care, 

because she goes about seeking those worthy of her, 
and she graciously appears to them in their paths,

and concern for instruction is love of her, 

and love of her is the keeping of her laws, 

and giving heed to her laws is assurance of immortality, 

and immortality brings one near to God; 

so the desire for wisdom leads to a kingdom. [Wisdom of Solomon (of the 
Apocrypha), RSV 6:12-20] 


also 


Therefore I prayed, and understanding was given me; 

I called upon God, and the spirit of wisdom came to me. 

I preferred her to scepters and thrones, 

and I accounted wealth as nothing in comparison with her. 

Neither did I liken to her any priceless gem, 

because all gold is but a little sand in her sight, 

and silver will be accounted as clay before her. 

I loved her more than health and beauty, 
and I chose to have her rather than light, 
because her radiance never ceases. 

All good things came to me along with her, 
and in her hands uncounted wealth. 

I rejoiced in them all, because wisdom leads them; 
but I did not know that she was their mother. 

I learned without guile and I impart without grudging; 

I do not hide her wealth, 

for it is an unfailing treasure for men; 

those who get it obtain friendship with God, 

commended for the gifts that come from instruction. 

May God grant that I speak with judgment 

and have thought worthy of what I have received, 

for he is the guide even of wisdom 

and the corrector of the wise. (Wisdom 7:7-15)

Wisdom may be personified as a spirit who eternally gives, who provides to her 
adherents unfailing riches. She is to be valued higher than status or material possessions, 
as the source of all things. With the categorical inexactitude characteristic of metaphoric 
thought and its attendant richness of connotation, the act of valuing this spirit is also 
Wisdom. So the matrix itself becomes conflated with—that is, grouped into the same 
category as—the attitude that makes of that matrix something beneficial. This conflation 
occurs because primal generative capacity characterizes both the “source of all things” 
and the exploratory/hopeful attitudes and actions that make of that source determinate 
things. We would only regard the latter—the “subjective stance”—as something clearly 
psychological (as something akin to “wisdom” in the modern sense). The former is more 
likely to be considered “external,” from our perspective—something beyond subjective 
intervention. But it is the case that without the appropriate attitude (Ask, and it shall be 
given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it shall be opened unto you: For every one 
that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth; and to him that knocketh it shall be 
opened” [Matthew 7:7-8].) the unknown is a sterile wasteland.' 14 Expectation and faith 
determine the “response” of the unknown (as courageous approach eliminates 
anticipatory anxiety, and exploration makes the unexpected something valuable). So the 
indiscriminate categorization characterizing these passages has its worth. 

We are motivated to protect the products of our exploration, our familiar territories, 
because unexplored phenomena are intrinsically meaningful, and that meaning is apt to 
show itself as threat. The probability that the meaning of unexplored territory will be 
threat, however, appears to be a function of the interpretive context within which it makes 
its appearance. If the unknown is approached voluntarily (which is to say, “as if’ it is 
beneficial), then its promising aspect is likely to appear more salient. If the unknown 
makes its appearance despite our desire, then it is likely to appear more purely in its 
aspect of threat. This means that if we are willing to admit to the existence of those things 
that we do not understand, those things are more likely to adopt a positive face. Rejection 
of the unknown, conversely, increases the likelihood that it will wear a terrifying visage 
when it inevitably manifests itself. It seems to me that this is one of the essential 
messages of the New Testament, with its express (although difficult-to-interpret) 
insistence that God should be regarded as all-good. 

The beneficial aspect of the unknown is something unavailable to the “unworthy,” 
something eternal and pure; something that enters into relationship with those who are 
willing, from age to age; and something that makes friends of God. The unknown is also 
something that may be conceptualized using sexual symbolism: something that may be 
“known,” in the biblical sense. Joined with, as with a “bride,” she produces all things that 
are good: 

I learned both what is secret and what is manifest, 
for wisdom, the fashioner of all things, taught me. 

For in her there is a spirit that is intelligent, holy, 

unique, manifold, subtle, 

mobile, clear, unpolluted, 

distinct, invulnerable, loving the good, keen, 

irresistible, 

beneficient, humane. 



Maps of meaning 168 


steadfast, sure, free from anxiety, 

all-powerful, overseeing all, 

and penetrating through all spirits 

that are intelligent and pure and most subtle. 

For wisdom is more mobile than any motion; 

because of her pureness she pervades and penetrates all things. 

For she is a breath of the power of God, 

and a pure emanation of the glory of the Almighty; 

therefore nothing defiled gains entrance into her. 

For she is a reflection of eternal light, 
a spotless mirror of the working of God, 
and an image of his goodness. 

Though she is but one, she can do all things, 

and while remaining in herself, she renews all things; 

in every generation she passes into holy souls 

and makes them friends of God, and prophets; 

for God loves nothing so much as the man who lives with wisdom. 

For she is more beautiful than the sun, 

and excels every constellation of the stars. 

Compared with the light she is found to be superior, 

for it is succeeded by the night, 

but against wisdom evil does not prevail. 

She reaches mightily from one end of the earth to the other, 
and she orders all things well. 

I loved her and sought her from my youth, 
and I desired to take her for my bride, 
and I became enamored of her beauty. 

She glorifies her noble birth by living with God, 
and the Lord of all loves her. 

For she is an initiate in the knowledge of God, 
and an associate in his works. 

If riches are a desirable possession in life, 
what is richer than wisdom who effects all things?

And if understanding is effective, 

who more than she is fashioner of what exists? (Wisdom 7:22—8:6) 315 

The terrible unknown compels representation; likewise, the beneficial unknown. We are 
driven to represent the fact that possibility resides in every uncertain event, that promise 
beckons from the depths of every mystery. Transformation, attendant upon the 
emergence of change, means the death of everything old and decayed—means the death 
of everything whose continued existence would merely mean additional suffering on the 
part of those still striving to survive. The terrible unknown, which paralyzes when it 
appears, is also succour for the suffering, calm for the troubled, peace for the warrior, 
insight and discovery for the perplexed and curious—is the redemptive jewel in the head 
of the toad or in the lair of the fire-belching dragon. The unknown is the fire that burns 
and protects, the endlessly mysterious transcendent object that simultaneously gives and 
takes away. The positive aspect of the unknown, incarnated as the many-breasted Greco- 
Roman Goddess Diana or Artemis, mistress of the animals, is portrayed in Figure 35: 
Unexplored Territory as Creative Mother . 16 

Everything that contains, shelters and produces exists as source for the symbolic 
representation of—occupies the same category as—this promising element. Fruit 



Maps of meaning 170 


distinctive for its seed-bearing properties, such as the pomegranate or poppy, provides 
appropriate motif for gravid containment. The pig stands as representative of fertility, and 
the cow—the holy beast of India—as embodiment of principle of nourishment. Shellfish 
“stand for” generation and fertility because of their vulvalike shape. Inanimate items such 
as boxes, sacks and troughs contain and shelter, while similar objects, such as the bed, the 
cradle and the nest are characterized by protective and therefore “maternal” function. 317 
Humanized representations—statuettes of nude goddesses, among the most ancient 
objects of representation known' 18 —appear to represent fecundity and the productive 
countenance of nature, in anthropomorphic form. The creation and subsequent 
appreciation of such figures perhaps aided individuals and societies in their efforts to 
clarify the nature of the human relationship to the protective aspect of existence. Makers 
of such statuettes placed great emphasis on collective, impersonal features of generation, 
such as breasts, genitals and hips (features whose functions remain largely outside 
voluntary control), but devoted little attention to features defining self-conscious 
individuality—like those of the face. Such figures apparently represented the vessel of 
life, and were rendered in the image of woman, whose body generated human life, and 
nourishment for that life. The body-vessel represented beneficial nature itself: 

All the basic vital functions occur in this vessel-body schema, whose 
“inside” is an unknown. Its entrance and exit zones are of special 
significance. Food and drink are put into this unknown vessel, while in all 
creative functions, from the elimination of waste and the emission of seed 
to the giving forth of breath and the word, something is “born” out of it. 

All body openings—eyes, ears, nose, mouth (navel), rectum, genital 
zone—as well as the skin, have, as places of exchange between inside and 
outside, a numinous accent for early man. They are therefore 
distinguished as “ornamental” and protected zones, and in man’s artistic 
self-representation they play a special role as idols. 319 

The unknown, source of all determinate information, is simultaneously destructive and 
creative. The terrible aspect of the Great Mother threatens everything with dissolution. 
Her positive sister is the generative aspect of being. Figure 36: The “Heavenly 
Genealogy” of the Destructive and Creative Mothers portrays the relationship between 
the two “discriminable” sisters, their derivation from the unified but ambivalent 
unknown, and their ultimate “descent” from the “dragon of chaos.” 

The ability to “restrict the appearance of the Terrible Mother,” and “foster the 
realization of her Benevolent Sister” (that is, the ability to decrease threat, and maximize 
promise and satisfaction) might well be regarded as the secret of successful adaptation. 
The existence of representations of the twin aspects of the unknown allowed for practice 
in adaptation in the face of such representations, allowed for exposure of the individual, 
in imagination and action, in controlled fashion, to potently constructed representations 
of those things that he or she was destined to fear most, was necessarily most vulnerable 
to, but which could not be forever avoided. Similar “rituals” underly every form of 
successful modern psychotherapy. 



Maps of Meaning 171 



Figure 36: The “Fleavenly Genealogy” of the 
Destructive and Creative Mothers 

Modern treatment for disorders of anxiety, to take a specific example— 
“desensitization”—involves exposing an individual, “ritualistically” (that is, under 
circumstances rendered predictable by authority), to novel or otherwise threatening 
stimuli (with appropriate reaction modeled by that authority. 320 Such desensitization 
theoretically induces “habituation”; what is actually happening is that guided exploration, 
in the course of behavior therapy, produces reclassification and behavioral adjustment 
[such that the once terrifying thing or once again terrifying thing is turned (back) into 
something controllable, familiar, and known]. Voluntary exposure additionally teaches 
the previously anxiety-ridden individual the nontrivial lesson that he or she is capable of 
facing the “place of fear’’ and prevailing. The process of guided voluntary exposure 
appears to produce therapeutic benefits even when the “thing being avoided” is 
traumatic 321 —when it might appear cruel, from a superficially “empathic” perspective, to 
insist upon exposure and “processing.” 

The ritual of voluntary exposure fosters mimetic identification with the hero (whether 
this is explicitly recognized or not); teaches the individual that the courageous 
exploratory spirit can eternally prevail over threat. It is this mimetic identification and its 
abstracted equivalents and consequences that account for the increased general 
confidence and capabilities that tend to accompany exposure training. The 




Maps of meaning 172 


reclassification and behavioral adjustment, attendant upon therapeutic exposure, places 
the previously terrible forces of the unknown back under the dominion of knowledge, 
into the domain of the known—expands “explored territory” into chaos—places the 
“Great Mother” under the strictures of her “consort,” culture, the Great Father. This is 
exploration-predicated “creation of the cosmos” from the precosmogonic chaos, and the 
fostering of implicit identification with the Logos, the creative and redemptive Word. 

Analysis of the much more dramatic, very widespread, but metaphorically equivalent 
phenomena of the sacritical ritual—a rite whose very existence compelled one insightful 
author to argue for the essential insanity of man 3 ’’ - provides additional insight into the 
nature of the ability to transform threat into promise. We have already discussed the fact 
that the valence of an object switches with context of interpretation. It is knowledge of 
this idea that allows for comprehension of the meaning of the sacrificial attitude. The 
beautiful countenance of the beneficial mother is the face the unknown adopts when 
approached from the proper perspective. Everything unknown is simultaneously 
horrifying and promising; it is courage and genius (and the grace of God) that determines 
which aspect dominates. The uncontrollable strength and bloodlust of the bull is the 
power which, when domesticated, serves to foster, protect and engender the herd. The 
devastating power of sudden explosive combustion is reliable and efficient transportation 
when appropriately harnessed. The gorgon of Nature is helpmistress when approached by 
the brave, the honest and the humble. 

Primary religious rituals, serving a key adaptive purpose, “predicated” upon 
knowledge of proper approach mechanisms, evolved to suit the space surrounding the 
primary deity, embodiment of the unknown. The ubiquitous drama of human sacrifice, 
(proto)typical of primordial religious practice, enacted the idea that the essence of man 
was something to be offered up voluntarily to the ravages of nature—something to be 
juxtaposed into creative encounter with the terrible unknown. The offering, in ritual, was 
often devoured, in reality or symbolically, as aid to embodiment of the immortal human 
spirit, as aid to incorporation of the heroic process. Such rituals were abstracted and 
altered, as they developed—with the nature of the sacrificial entity changing (with 
constancy of underlying “ideation”). 

As late as 1871, in India the festival honoring the Great Mother, in the guise of 
Durga 323 or Kali, was accompanied by the daily slaughter of twenty buffalo, two hundred 
and fifty goats, and two hundred and fifty pigs. The blood-drenched sand in the sacrificial 
pits was replaced twice a day—removed and buried in the earth to ensure fertility. The 
slaughter of animals is a relatively late development from the psychohistorical viewpoint, 
and is generally preceded by, and stands in place of, the ritual sacrifice of human victims. 
The indologist Heinrich Zimmer states: 

In her “hideous aspect” (ghora-rupa) the goddess, as Kali, “the dark one,” 
raises the skull hill of seething blood to her lips; her devotional image 
shows her dressed in blood red, standing in a boat floating on a sea of 
blood: in the midst of the life flood, the sacrificial sap, which she requires 
that she may, in her gracious manifestation (sundara-murti) as the world 
mother (jagad-amba), bestow existence upon new living forms in a 
process of unceasing procreation, that as world nurse (jagad-dhatri) she 
may suckle them at her breasts and give them the food that is “hill of 



Maps of Meaning 173 


nourishment” (anna-puma). An ancient conception, extending back as far 
as the Stone Age: Nature must at every step be given a helping hand; even 
she can accomplish nothing by herself. She is no more self-sufficient than 
man. Nothing takes place of itself, either in the cosmos or in human 
beings. Man must perform clamorous rites in order to liberate the moon 
from the clutches of the eclipse, to dispel its demons; and if the sun is to 
be released from its winter feebleness and rise ever higher with the rising 
year, a young girl, symbolizing the sun, must swing higher and higher into 
the sky. In order to bear fruit and nurture life, the earth mother demands to 
be fertilized and strengthened by potations of blood, the vital fluid. 324 

The mysterious and seemingly irrational “sacrificial” ritual actually dramatizes or acts 
out two critically important and related ideas: first, that the essence of man—that is, the 
divine aspect—must constantly be “offered up” to the unknown, must present itself 
voluntarily to the destructive/creative power that constitutes the Great Mother, 
incarnation of the unpredictable (as we have seen); and second, that the “thing that is 
loved best’’ must be destroyed—that is, sacrificed—in order for the positive aspect of the 
unknown to manifest itself 

The former idea is “predicated” on the notion that the unknown must be encountered, 
voluntarily, for new information to be generated, for new behavioral patterns to be 
constructed; the latter idea is “predicated” on the observation that an improper or 
outdated or otherwise invalid attachment—such as the attachment to an inappropriate 
pattern of behavior or belief—turns the world into waste, by interfering with the process 
of adaptation itself. Rigid, inflexible attachment to “inappropriate things of value”— 
indicative of dominance by a pathological hierarchy of values (a “dead god”)—is 
tantamount to denial of the hero. Someone miserable and useless in the midst of plenty— 
just for the sake of illustration—is unhappy because of his or her attachments to the 
wrong “things.” Unhappiness is frequently the consequence of immature or rigid 
thinking—a consequence of the overvaluation of phenomena that are in fact trivial. The 
neurotic clings to the things that make her unhappy, while devaluing the processes, 
opportunities and ideas that would free her, if she adopted them. The sacrifice of the 
“thing loved best” to “appease the gods” is the embodiment in procedure of the idea that 
the benevolent aspect of the unknown will return if the present schema of adaptation (the 
“ruling king”) is sufficiently altered (that is, destroyed and regenerated). An individual 
stripped of his “identification” with what he previously valued is simultaneously 
someone facing the unknown—and is, therefore, someone “unconsciously” imitating the 
hero. The voluntary “stripping” of such identity makes the supplicant into a “new man”— 
at least if the sacrifice was genuine. This is not to say that such ideas cannot degenerate 
into meaningless, empty and cruel ritual. 

The intimate relationship between clinging to the past, rejection of heroism, and denial 
of the unknown is most frequently explicated in narrative form (perhaps because the 
association is so complex that it has not yet been made explicit). The following fairy 
tale—a “wakeup call,” from the psychoanalytic-“unconscious”—may serve as useful 
exemplar. It occurred spontaneously to me, in a single piece, while I was trying to help a 
man I knew, who was undergoing a psychological crisis. His attachment to the 
unnecessary and superfluous was putting his future in serious danger, but he would not

admit this. I wanted to warn him that he would eventually pay a great price for his short¬ 
sightedness. He ignored the story, however, at least in the short term—with predictable 
results. 


Cock-a-doodle-doo 

Once upon a time there was a man who had a long hard journey ahead of 
him. He was trudging along the way, over the boulders and through the 
brushes, when he saw a little shiny gnome with big white teeth and a 
black toupee sitting by the side of the road. He was drumming on a log 
with two white bones, and humming oddly to himself. The little gnome 
said, 

“John—why work so hard? Why walk so fast? Who knows if you’ll 
ever get there anyway? Come over here. I have something to show you.” 

So John walked off the road. He was sick of walking, anyhow, because 
people kept throwing sticks and stones at him. The little gnome said, 

“I have a shiny red jewel I would like to sell you. Cheap. Here it is,” 
and from beneath his cloak he pulled the biggest ruby that the man had 
ever seen. It must have weighed a hundred pounds, and it shone like the 
sun. 

The gnome said, “Do you like it? It is an enchanted stone. What will 
you offer me for it?” and the man said, “I don’t have much—much 
money. But I will give you everything I have.” The gnome looked 
displeased, so John added: “I could pay some more monthly.” 

So the gnome accepted: “Fair enough! Buy now, pay later. Sounds 
good to me. I’m all for the installment plan.” 

So the man gave the gnome all his money, and promised to pay the rest 
later. And the gnome walked back into the bush by the road, clacking his 
teeth and giggling and twitching. 

The more the man thought about his ruby, and the great deal he got, the 
happier he became. He started back on the road, with a light heart, but 
soon discovered that he couldn’t make much progress, because a hundred 
pounds was a lot to carry. He said to himself: 

“Why continue, anyway? I have what I want. Why don’t I just stand 
here, holding my ruby—and when people walk by, they can see how well 
I have already done!” 

So he stopped. A little while later, one of his friends came along, and 
saw him standing there. His friend said, 

“John, why don’t you come along with me? I have just opened a new 
business, and I could really use some help! Come along quick! It will be 
opening soon!” 

John thought that sounded good, but his friend was in a hurry. Besides, 
couldn’t he see the ruby? How could he speed along beside him? Where 
would he put his jewel? So he said, “Thanks, but I have to take care of my 
jewel. Maybe I’ll see you later.” 



Maps of Meaning 175 


His friend looked at him like he was crazy—but he was trying to get 
somewhere quick. So he just shrugged a bit and said, “Okay, John. See 
you later,” and he sped on down the road. 

A little while later, another friend came by, and he said, “John! Nice to 
see you! I am going back to school! There are lots of wonderful things to 
learn! Lots of great things to do! The world is frill of unsolved problems! I 
could use some company! Would you like to come along?” John thought 
that sounded pretty good—but this friend, too, looked like he was in a 
hurry. Besides, standing beside the road, holding the jewel, was tiring, and 
he needed all the energy he had for that. So he said to his friend, “Thanks, 
but I have to take care of my jewel. Isn’t it beautiful? Maybe I’ll see you 
later.” 

His friend looked at him like he was crazy—but he was trying to get 
somewhere quick. So he just shrugged and said, “Hope everything goes 
all right with you. See you later.” 

Many friends came and went, and the years went by. The jewel got 
heavier and heavier, but the man got more and more attached to it. The 
only thing was, nobody seemed to notice how beautiful it was. People 
would rush by, and talk about their plans 
and nobody had a ruby as big 
and nobody seemed likely to get a ruby as big 
so you’d think that someone might have said something 
something, at least, like 

“Nice ruby, John. Sure wish I had one like that.” 

But it never happened. 

Then one day someone new came down the road. He was bent over, 
and he was thin, and his hair was gray, although he did not look that old. 
He was carrying a big, dirty rock carefully in his arms, and he was not 
making much progress. 

The strange figure approached and glanced up at John. Then he grinned 
and said, 

“Why are you standing there stupidly, with a big ugly rock in your 
tired old hands? You look pretty daft. I bet you wish you had a big ruby, 
like the one I am carrying!” and John thought, “This poor man is deluded. 
He is carrying a rock—it is I who have the ruby!” so he said, “Excuse me 
sir, but you are sadly mistaken. I am the one with the jewel. I met a little 
gnome by the side of the road, and he sold it to me. I am still paying for 
it—although not so very much! You are carrying a rock!” 

The tired stranger looked annoyed. He said, “I don’t know what game 
you are playing, mister. You have a rock. I have a jewel. The little gnome 
you described sold it to me—and he said it was the only one! I have been 
carrying it for twenty years, and I will never let it go!” and John said, “But 
I have been carrying mine for twenty years, too. It can’t be just a rock!” 
Rock or jewel? On and on they argued. 



Maps of meaning 176 


Suddenly, out stepped the little gnome, as if he had never left! Only 
this time, he wasn’t so little. He was bigger, and redder, and menacing, 
and his laugh sounded like the rattling of chains. 

“Quit arguing, you two! I’ve never seen a sight quite so pathetic. 

You’re carrying rocks—both of you. And if you ever would have had the 
sense to put them down for a second or two, you would have seen that! 

“Oh well, at least you were diligent. And I played a mean trick. I feel 
bad. 

“So, I’m going to give you what you really deserve. Do you want what 
you really deserve?” and John and the thin stranger nodded eagerly. 

Finally, they thought. 

“You haven’t seen anything yet. Throw down your rocks!” 

So John and the thin stranger obeyed. Each rock split down the middle, 
when it hit the ground. Out flowed a river of ravenous white worms, 
which rashed toward the men and devoured them whole, while they 
thrashed about and screamed. 

Soon, nothing was left except a leg bone from each. The little gnome 
picked them up, and walked off the road. He sat down by a hollow log, 
and started to dram. 

He drummed, and he waited, and he hummed an odd little tune: 

“A picture of food 

feeds the whole hungry clan 

the image of good 

makes the whole healthy man 

Why walk the mile? 

Why do the work? 

Just smile the smile!

who wants to live?” 

It is ideas of the “necessity of sacrifice” that underlie, for example, the well-known but 
explicitly incomprehensible ritual of Christian communion (more accurately, the ritual of 
the Christian communion serves as one behavioral precursor for these explicit ideas). The 
Christian hero—Christ—is the spirit who offers himself voluntarily to the cross, to the 
grave, to suffering and death, to the terrible mother. Such a spirit is, above all, 
“humble”—which is a very paradoxical term, in this context. Arrogance is belief in 
personal omniscience. Heroic humility, set against such arrogance, means recognition of 
constant personal error, conjoined with belief in the ability to transcend that error (to face 
the unknown, and to update fallible belief, in consequence). “Humble” therefore means, 
“greater than dogma” (as the spirit of man is a “higher power” than the laws which 



Maps of Meaning 177 


govern his behavior). Christ’s body (represented, in the communion ritual, by the “ever- 
resurrecting” wheaten wafer), is the container of the incarnate spirit of the dying, reborn 
and redemptive deity. This “body” is ritually devoured—that is, incorporated—to aid the 
ritual participants in their identification with Christ, the eternally dying and resurrecting 
(sun) god. Construction of this awful ritual meant furtherance of the abstract 
conceptualization of a permanent structural aspect of (every) human psyche—the heroic 
aspect, the Word —as active, individually doomed, yet mythically eternal, destined to 
tragic contact with threat and promise of unknown, yet constant participant in the creative 
adaptive redemptive process. 

The ritual act of exposure is held simultaneously to placate or minimize the cruel 
aspect of nature, and to allow for establishment of contact with the beneticient. From the 
modern perspective, it might be said (much more abstractly) that voluntary cautious, 
careful, exploratory encounter with the threatening and unknown constitutes the 
precondition for transformation of that unknown into the promising (or at least the 
mundane), as a consequence of shift in behavior or interpretation. We moderns interpret 
this “change in experience” as alteration in subjective state. The pre-experimental mind, 
less capable of clearly differentiating subject from object, more concerned with the 
motivational significance of the experience, observes instead that the fear-inducing 
character of the object has receded (as a consequence of the courage of the explorer, or 
the benevolence of the thing in question). 

Ritual sacrifice was an early (pre-abstract behavioral) variant of the “idea” of heroism, 
of belief in individual power—the acting out of the idea that voluntary exposure to the 
unknown (or dissolution of the most favored thing) constituted a necessary precondition 
(1) for the emergence of the beneficial “goddess” and (2) for continued successful 
adaptation. Incorporation of the sacrificial individual, in actuality (in ritual cannibalism) 
or in religious ceremony (in the mass, for example) meant assimilation of the culture- 
hero. Such incorporation was a “preconscious” attempt to embody the heroic essence, to 
fortify the constituent elements of the community against paralyzing fear of death and 
darkness—to fortify the individual and the social group against fear of the unknown 
itself. The sacrificial ritual was acting out of the hero, before such “acting out” could be 
represented in abstraction, in drama, in story. More abstract narrative representation of 
the target of the “heroic sacrifice” then came to portray the emergence of the beneficient 
goddess, capable of showering reward upon man, her eternal lover and child. 

The spirit forever willing to risk personal (more abstractly, intrapsychic) destruction to 
gain redemptive knowledge might be considered the archetypal representative of the 
adaptive process as such. The pre-experimental mind considered traumatic union of this 
“masculine” representative with the destructive and procreative feminine unknown a 
necessary precedent to continual renewal and rebirth of the individual and community. 
This is an idea precisely as magnificent as that contained in the Osiris/Horus myth; an 
idea which adds additional depth to the brilliant “moral hypotheses” contained in that 
myth. The exploratory hero, divine son of the known and unknown, courageously faces 
the unknown, unites with it creatively—abandoning all pretence of pre-existent “absolute 
knowledge”—garners new information, returns to the community, and revitalizes his 
tradition. It is to this more complete story that we now turn our attention.

The great androgynous dragon of chaos is also the mythic figure who guards a great

He is the fire-breathing winged serpent of transformation—the undescribable union of 
everything now discriminated, who constantly schemes to take back what he produced. 
The Great and Terrible Mother, daughter of chaos, destroys those who approach her

them: he is precondition for existence, but impediment to its successful elaboration. What 
might possibly constitute “the appropriate pattern of action” in the face of such 
permanent and multifarious contradiction? 

The fundamental act of creativity in the human realm, in the concrete case, is the 
construction of a pattern of behavior which produces emotionally desirable results in a 
situation that previously reeked of unpredictability, danger and promise. Creative acts, 
despite their unique particulars, have an eternally identifiable structure, because they 
always takes place under the same conditions: what is known is “extracted,” eternally, 
from the unknown. In consequence, it is perpetually possible to derive and re-derive the 
central features of the metapattern of behavior which always and necessarily means 
human advancement. Human beings are curious about the structure and function of 
everything, not least themselves; our capacity to tell stories reflects our ability to describe 
ourselves. It has been said that Freud merely recapitulated Shakespeare. But it was 
Freud’s genius, despite his manifold errors, to bring what Shakespeare portrayed 
dramatically up one level of abstraction, toward the philosophical (or even the empirical). 
Freud moved information about behavior from the implicit narrative to the explicit theory 
(or, at least, to the more explicit theory). Shakespeare performed a similar maneuver, like 
all storytellers, at a more “basic” level— he abstracted from what was still behavioral, 
from what had not even yet been captured effectively in drama. 

During exploration, behavior and representational schema are modified in an 
experimental fashion, in the hopes of bringing about by ingenious means whatever 
outcome is currently envisioned. Such exploration also produces alteration of the sensory 
world—since that world changes with shift in motor output and physical locale. 
Exploration produces transformation in assumption guiding behavior, and in expectation 
of behavioral outcome', produces learning in knowing how and knowing what mode. Most 
generally, new learning means the application of a new means to the same end, which 
means that the pattern of presumptions underlying the internal model of the present and 
the desired future remain essentially intact. This form of readaptation might be described 
as normal creativity, and constitutes the bulk of human thought. However, on rare 
occasions, ongoing activity (specifically goal-directed or exploratory) produces more 
profound and unsettling mismatch. This is more stressful (and more promising), and 
necessitates more radical update of modeling—necessitates exploration-guided 
reprogramming of fundamental behavioral assumption and associated episodic or 



Maps of Meaning 179 


semantic representation. Such reprogramming also constitutes creativity, but of the 
revolutionary’ type, generally associated with genius. Exploration is therefore creation 
and re-creation of the world. The generation of new information from contact with the 
unknown means the construction of experience itself; the destruction of previous modes 
of adaptation and representation (previous “worlds”) means return of “explored territory” 
to the unexplored condition that preceded it, and then its restructuring, in more 
comprehensive form. This is encounter with the Great and Terrible Mother, and death 
and resurrection of the Son and the Father. 

A new manner of dealing with (that is, behaving with regard to or classifying) an 
emergent unknown is the gift of the hero. This gift demands to be given; compels 
communication—either directly (say, in the form of immediate imitation), or indirectly 
(in the form of abstract description, or narrative). There is no real qualitative distinction 
between transformation of means and transformation of ends (as we have seen): what 
constitutes “ends” at a lower level of analysis becomes “means” at a higher level. It 
follows that the “gift of the hero” constitutes normal and revolutionary adaptation, 
simultaneously —normal adaptation, as schemas of action and representation are 
extended, such that the unknown is rendered beneficial; revolution, as the old is 
restructured, to allow place for the new. This restructuring is equivalent to the 
establishment of peace —the peace characterizing the mythic paradise where the lion lays 
down with the lamb. Such peace emerges as a consequence of the hierarchical 
organization of the “gods of tradition” under the dominion of the hero. This means that 
the creative exploratory hero is also peacemaker, in his complete manifestation: 

I dreamed that I was standing in the grassy yard of a stone cathedral, on 
a bright sunny day. The yard was unblemished, a large, well-kept green 
expanse. As I stood there, I saw a slab of grass pull back under the earth, 
like a sliding door. Underneath the “door” was a rectangidar hole that 
was clearly a grave. I was standing on an ancient graveyard, whose 
existence had been forgotten. A medieval king, dressed in solid armor, 
rose out of the grave, and stood at attention at the head of his burial site. 

Similar slabs slid back, one after another, in numerous places. Out of 
each rose a king, each from a different period of time. 

The kings were all powerful, in their own right. Now, however, they 
occupied the same territory. They became concerned that they would 
fight, and they asked me how this might be prevented. I told them the 
meaning of the Christian wedding ceremony—a ritual designed to 
subjugate the two central participants to the superordinate authority of 
Christ, the Christian hero, and said that this was the way to peace. 

If all the great kings would bow, voluntarily, to the figure of the hero, 
there would be no more reason for war 

Every unmapped territory—that is, every place where what to do has not been 
specified—also constitutes the battleground for ancestral kings. The learned patterns of 
action and interpretation that vie for application when a new situation arises can be 
usefully regarded, metaphorically, as the current embodiments of adaptive strategies 
formulated as a consequence of past exploratory behavior—as adaptive strategies 



Maps of meaning 180 


invented and constructed by the heroes of the past, “unconsciously” mimicked and 
duplicated by those currently alive. 

Adaptation to new territory—that is, to the unexpected—therefore also means 
successful mediation of archaic or habitual strategies competing, in the new situation, for 
dominance over behavioral output. Rank-ordering of these “warring” strategies— 
construction of a context-specific behavioral “dominance hierarchy” (which corresponds 
to the nested narrative model proposed earlier)—therefore constitutes adaptation, just as 
much as creation of new situation-specific behaviors or modes of interpretation (which 
are inevitably composed, anyway, of bits and pieces of the past). The process of 
exploration, including its assimilative and accommodative aspects, is therefore inevitably 
entangled with the process of peacemaking. Exploration, in a given situation, can hardly 
be regarded as complete until the tendencies and theories that struggle for predominance 
in that situation have been organized to make internal (or externalized) conflict and 
emotional upheaval cease. 

The exploratory hero, mankind’s savior, cuts the primordial chaos into pieces and 
makes the world; rescues his dead father from the underworld, and revivifies him; and 
organizes the “nobles” occupying his kingdom into an effective, flexible and dynamic 
hierarchy. There is no categorical difference between the individual who explores and the 
individual who reconstructs “society,” as a consequence of that exploration. 
Accomodation to new information is an integral part of the exploratory process: an 
anomaly has not been processed until the preexistent interpretive schemas extant prior to 
its emergence have been reconfigured to take its presence into account. Every explorer is 
therefore, by necessity, a revolutionary—and every successful revolutionary is a 
peacemaker. 

We act appropriately before we understand how we act—just as children learn to 
behave before they can describe the reasons for their behavior. It is only through the 
observation of our actions, accumulated and distilled over centuries, that we come to 
understand our own motivations, and the patterns of behavior that characterize our 
cultures (and these are changing as we model them). Active adaptation precedes 
abstracted comprehension of the basis for such adaptation. This is necessarily the case, 
because we are more complex than we can understand, as is the world to which we must 
adjust ourselves. 

First we act. Afterward, we envision the pattern that constitutes our actions. Then we 
use that pattern to guide our actions. It is establishment of conscious (declarative) 
connection between behavior and consequences of that behavior (which means 
establishment of a new feedback process) that enables us to abstractly posit a desired 
future, to act in such a way as to bring that future about, and to judge the relevance of 
emergent phenomena themselves on the basis of their apparent relevance to that future. 
This ability appears to be predicated on some developmental leap—at least insofar as the 
“guiding story” has become conscious (or represented in episodic or semantic memory, 
as opposed to remaining implicitly embedded in behavior)—and appears unlikely to 
characterize very young children (or animals, for that matter). Jean Piaget solved the 
problem of the “goal-like” behavior in creatures not yet capable of abstract 
conceptualization by presuming that “goals” are initially embedded in sensori-motor 
reflex operations, which are instinctive. This essentially means that what is later story is 
at first pattern —the pattern of socially modified behavior that constitutes human being. It 



Maps of Meaning 181 


is only later, as “higher-order” (episodic or semantic) cognitive systems become 
activated, that goals become explicitly imagined (and that they can be considered, 
abstractly, before their enaction). So this means that it is possible to act in a manner that 
looks as if it were goal-directed, before goals as such have manifested themselves. 
Rychlak describes Piaget’s observation: “Children do not appear to be logicians at birth, 
conceptually interacting by constructing schema from the outset. The initial constructions 
are being done biologically, and only at some time later does the child schematize the 
reflexive patterns already underway... ,” 325 

First comes the action pattern, guided by instinct, shaped without conscious realization 
by the consequences of socially mediated “rewards” and “punishments” (determined in 
their “structure and locale” by the current social mores, products of historical forces). 
Then comes the capacity to imagine the end toward which behavior “should” be directed. 
Information generated from the observation of behavior provides the basis for 
constructing fantasies about such ends. Actions that satisfy emotions have a pattern; 
abstraction allows us to represent and duplicate that pattern, as an end. The highest-level 
abstractions therefore allow us to represent the most universally applicable behavioral 
pattern: that characterizing the hero, who eternally turns the unknown into something 
secure and beneficial; who eternally reconstructs the secure and beneficial, when it has 
degenerated into tyranny. 

The myth of the hero has come to represent the essential nature of human possibility, 
as manifested in adaptive behavior, as a consequence of observation and rerepresentation 
of such behavior, conducted cumulatively over the course of thousands of years. The hero 
myth provides the structure that governs, but does not determine, the general course of 
history; expresses one fundamental preconception in a thousand different ways. This idea 
(analogous in structure to the modern hypothesis, although not explicitly formulated, nor 
rationally constructed in the same manner) renders individual creativity socially 
acceptable and provides the precondition for change. The most fundamental presumption 
of the myth of the hero is that the nature of human experience can be (should be) 
improved by voluntary alteration in individual human attitude and action. This 
statement— the historical hypothesis —is an expression of faith in human possibility itself 
and constitutes the truly revolutionary idea of historical man. 

All specific adaptive behaviors (which are acts that restrict the destructive or enhance 
the beneficial potential of the unknown) follow a general pattern. This “pattern”—which 
at least produces the results intended (and therefore desired)—inevitably attracts social 
interest. “Interesting” or “admirable” behaviors engender imitation and description. Such 
imitation and description might first be of an interesting or admirable behavior, but is 
later of the class of interesting and admirable behaviors. The class is then imitated as a 
general guide to specific actions; is redescribed, redistilled and imitated once again. The 
image of the hero, step by step, becomes ever clearer, and ever more broadly applicable. 
The pattern of behavior characteristic of the hero—that is, voluntary advance in the face 
of the dangerous and promising unknown, generation of something of value as a 
consequence and, simultaneously, dissolution and reconstruction of current knowledge, 
of current morality —comes to form the kernel for the good story, cross-culturally. That 
story—which is what to do, when you no longer know what to do—defines the central 
pattern of behavior embedded in all genuinely religious systems (furthermore, provides 
the basis for the “respect due the individual” undergirding our conception of natural

rights). Representations of the uroboros, the dragon of chaos, and his daughter, the Great 
Mother, are symbolic portrayals of the unknown. Mythological representation of the hero 
and his cultural construction are, by contrast, examination and portrayal of who or what it 
is that knows, and of what it is that is known. The creative and destructive feminine is the 
personality manifested in mythology by everything unknown, threatening and promising, 
about and within existence. Myth tends to portray the generative individual consciousness 
eternally willing to face this unknown power as masculine, in essence—in 
contradistinction to unconscious, impersonal, and unpredictable femininity, and in light 
of its “seminal,” active, “fructifying” nature. 

The earliest “stages” of the development of the figure of the hero take the form of 
mythic representations of the infant or adolescent, fully or partially dominated by potent 
maternal force. 326 This infant or adolescent is the specific individual, under the sway of 
the particular mother—and Homo sapiens, the species, subject to nature. “Generative 
individual consciousness” as “eternal son of the virginal mother” is represented in Figure 
37: The Exploratory Hero as Son of the Heavenly Mother? 21 In his more mature form, 
the hero—formerly “son of the heavenly mother”—can be portrayed as “lover of the 
Great Mother” [the mother whose body he “enters” into, in creative (sexual) union, to die 
and reincarnate (to fertilize and impregnate)]. The Great Mother is the holy prostitute, the 
whore of Babylon, as well as the Virgin Mother, a maiden forever renewed, forever 
young, belonging to all men, but to no one man. Myth commonly utilizes the 
(symbolically sexual) motif of heavenly incest —the image of devouring or engulfing 
encounter, rife with creative potential—to represent union with the primordial feminine, 
to portray act of creative (or destructive) encounter between the hero and the possibilities 
of life itself. This is “knowledge” as sexual, creative act: the “voluntary generative union” 
of consciousness and chaos produces—or revives—order and cosmos. 

The mythology of the hero, in toto, depicts the development and establishment of a 
personality capable effacing the most extreme conditions of existence. The hero’s quest 
or journey has been represented in mythology and ritual in numerous ways, but the 
manifold representations appear in accordance with the myth of the way, as previously 
described: a harmonious community or way of life, predictable and stable in structure and 
function, is unexpectedly threatened by the emergence of (previously harnessed) 
unknown and dangerous forces. An individual of humble and princely origins rises, by 
free choice, to counter this threat. This individual is exposed to great personal trials and 
risks or experiences physical and psychological dissolution. Nonetheless, he overcomes 
the threat, is magically restored (frequently improved) and receives a great reward, in 
consequence. He returns to his community with the reward, and (re)establishes social 
order (sometimes after a crisis engendered by his return). 

This most fundamental of stories is portrayed schematically in Figure 38: The Meta¬ 
mythology of the Way, Revisited? 2 * Chaos breeds novelty, promising and threatening; 
the hero leaves his community, voluntarily, to face this chaos. His exploratory/creative 
act quells the

Heavenly Mother 

threat embedded in chaos, and frees what is promising from its grip. Incorporation of this 
freed promise (this “redemptive” information)—symbolized by union with the virgin, or 
discovery of the treasure—transforms the hero. His transformed (enriched) behavior then 
serves his community as model. The group is therefore transformed and restabilized in 
turn. 

The ultimate or archetypal representation of the original “threatened” state is the 
unselfconscious (but “incomplete”) paradise that existed prior to the “fall” of humanity. 
More prosaically, that state is the innocence and potential of childhood, the glory of the 
past, the strength of the well-ruled kingdom, the power of the city, the stability, wealth 
and happiness of the family. The most primordial threat is the sudden (re)appearance or 
discovery of one of the manifestations of the Terrible Mother: a flood, an earthquake, a 
war, a monster (some type of dragon), a fish, a whale—anything unpredictable or 
unexpected that destroys,

Figure 38: The Metamythology of the Way, Revisited 

devours, traps, engulfs, dismembers, tortures, terrifies, weakens, mystifies, entrances, 
smothers or poisons (this is a partial list). The hero, product of divine parentage and 
miraculous birth, survivor of a dangerous childhood, faces the Terrible Mother in single 
combat and is devoured. He is swallowed by a great fish, or snake, or whale, and spends 
time underground, in the dark, in the winter, in the kingdom of the dead, or in hell; faces 
a dragon, a gorgon, a witch or temptress; is inundated by water, by fire, by storm, by 
dangerous animals; is tormented, buried alive, mesmerized, dismembered, disemboweled 
and deluded. He defeats the monster, freeing those who had been previously defeated, 
and gains or regains a lost or previously undiscovered object of value, a (virginal) woman 
or a treasure. Much older, much wiser, he returns home, transformed in character, bearing 
what he has gained, and reunites himself triumphantly with his community, which is 
much enriched—or even utterly transformed—by his fortune. 329 

The battle of the hero is a frequent motif in mythologically inspired sculpture, drawing 
and painting. A representative example is presented in Figure 39: Castle, Hero, Serpent 
and Virgin: St. George and the Dragon. 330 All of the elements of the “meta-myth” are 
portrayed in 


Maps of Meaning 185 



Figure 39: Castle, Hero, Serpent and Virgin: St. 
George and the Dragon 


this drawing: the threatened community, represented by the walled city or castle; the 
winged dragon, who has emerged from the underworld (and whose lair is surrounded by 
the bones of the dead); the hero, armed with the sword, who “cuts” the leviathan into 
pieces, and makes the world; and the virgin, freed from the dragon’s clutches, who 
represents the benevolent, creative and fruitful aspect of the unknown. (The city is 
commonly portrayed on a mountain, in such representations—the serpent in a valley, or 
across a river. The battle takes place at sundown [when the sun deity encounters the 
dragon of the night]. ’ ’ 1 ) 

Solar myths portray the journey of the hero, utilizing simultaneously the motifs of the 
dragon fight and the “night sea journey.” In the typical solar myth, the hero is identified 
with the sun, bearer of the light of consciousness, who is devoured nightly by the water 
serpent of the West. In the night, he battles terribly with this monster, and emerges 
victorious in the morning, rising renewed in the East: 

In this sequence of danger, battle, and victory, the light—whose 
significance for consciousness we have repeatedly stressed—is the central 
symbol of the hero’s reality. The hero is always a light-bringer and 
emissary of the light. At the nethermost point of the night sea journey, 
when the sun hero journeys through the underworld and must survive the 
fight with the dragon, the new sun is kindled at midnight and the hero 



Maps of meaning 186 


conquers the darkness. At this same lowest point of the year Christ is born 
as the shining Redeemer, as the light of the year and light of the world, 
and is worshipped with the Christmas tree at the winter solstice. The new 
light and the victory are symbolized by the illumination of the head, 
crowned and decked with an aureole. 332 

The Mesopotamian emperors and the pharaohs of Egypt were solar gods, representatives 
of the incarnated sun deity, eternal victor of the unending battle between order and chaos, 
light and darkness, known and unknown. In an allegorical sense, they might be 
considered the first true individuals—at least from the perspective of the Western 
historical tradition. The Egyptian people devoted their entire cultural endeavor to 
glorification of their rulers—motivated, unconsciously, by their participation in (their 
imitative identification with) the essential god-stature of the pharaoh. This idea was 
developed (abstracted and generalized) further by the Greeks, who attributed to each 
male Greek a soul, and taken to its logical conclusion by the Jews and the Christians, who 
granted every person absolute and inviolable individual worth before (or [potential] 
identity with) God. 

The Great Mother is embodiment of the unknown, of the novel. The hero—her son 
and lover, offspring of the mystical marriage—is dramatic (first concrete behavioral, then 
imitative/imagistic, then verbal) representation of the pattern of action capable of making 
creative use of that unknown. The potential for expression of (and admiration for; or 
representation of) that pattern constitutes a heritable characteristic of the human psyche, 
expressed constantly in behavior during the course of human cultural activity. 
Containment of this pattern in dynamic image, in myth, follows centuries of observation, 
and generation of hypotheses, regarding the core nature of Homo sapiens, the historical 
animal. The development of such containment followed a complex path of increasingly 
abstracted description and redescription of self and other. 

The hero is a pattern of action, designed to make sense of the unknown; he emerges, 
necessarily, wherever human beings are successful. Adherence to this central pattern 
ensures that respect for the process of exploration (and the necessary reconfiguration of 
belief, attendant upon that process) always remains superordinate to all other 
considerations, including that of the maintenance of stable belief This is why Christ, the 
defining hero of the Western ethical tradition, is able to say, “I am the way, the truth, and 
the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me” (John 14:6); why adherence to the 
Eastern way (Tao)—extant on the border between chaos (yin) and order (yang)—ensures 
that the “cosmos” will continue to endure. Figure 40: The Process of Exploration and 
Update, as the Meta-Goal of Existence schematically presents the “highest goal” of life, 
conceptualized from such a perspective: identification with the process of constructing 
and updating contingent and environment-specific goals is in this schema given necessary 
precedence over identification with any particular, concretized goal. Spirit is thus 
elevated over dogma. 

We use stories to regulate our emotions and govern our behavior. They provide the 
present we inhabit with a determinate point of reference—the desired future. The optimal 
“desired

future” is not a state, however, but a process: the (intrinsically compelling) process of 
mediating between order and chaos; the process of the incarnation of Logos —the Word— 
which is the world-creating principle. 333 Identification with this process, rather than with 
any of its determinate outcomes (that is, with any “idols” or fixed frames of reference or 
ideologies) ensures that emotion will stay optimally regulated and action remain possible 
no matter how the environment shifts, and no matter when. In consequence of such 
identification, respect for belief comes to take second place to respect for the process by 
which belief is generated. 

The hero is narrative representation of the individual eternally willing to take creative 
action, endlessly capable of originating new behavioral patterns, eternally specialized to 
render harmless or positively beneficial something previously threatening or unknown. It 
is declarative representation of the pattern of behavior characteristic of the hero that 
eventually comes to approximate the story of the savior. Behind every particular (that is, 
historical) adventurer, explorer, creator, revolutionary and peacemaker lurks the image of 
the “son of god,” who sets his impeccable character against tyranny and the unknown. 
The arche-typic or ultimate example of the savior is the world redeemer, the Messiah— 
world-creating and -redeeming hero, social revolutionary and great reconciliator. It is the 
sum total of the activity of the Messiah, accumulated over the course of time, that 
constitutes culture, the Great Father, order itself—explored territory, the domain of the

known. In the “meta-stable” society, however, the Father, though healthy, is subordinate 
to the Son: all fixed values necessarily remain subject to the pattern of being represented 
by the hero. In the “City of God”—that is, the archetypal human kingdom—the Messiah 
eternally rules: 

I saw in the night visions, and, behold, one like the Son of man came with 
the clouds of heaven, and came to the Ancient of days, and they brought 
him near before him. 

And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all 
people, nations, and languages, should serve him: his dominion is an 
everlasting dominion, which shall not pass away, and his kingdom that 
which shall not be destroyed. (Daniel 7:13-14) 


The Great Father: Images of the Known, or Explored Territory 

All particular adaptive behaviors (and interpretive schemas—schemas of value ) are 
generated over the course of time by the eternal pattern of behavior described in mythic 
language as characteristic of the archetypal hero, the sun god. These behaviors and 
schemas accumulate over the centuries (as a consequence of imitation and other forms of 
memory communication), but do not necessarily agree, are not necessarily 
commensurate. Our hard-won adaptive methods struggle for predominance, often 
violently, within a given individual, between individuals within societies, and between 
societies. The problem of organization therefore arises. How do you arrange your 
possibilities, once you have originated them or copied them from someone else? How is 
it possible to make sense of the historical accretion of knowledge and wisdom? After all, 
multiple opportunities for behavioral output exist, in any given situation; furthermore, the 
possibility of interpretation makes even the “situation” mutable. How can competing 
possibilities—the multiplicity of potential choices—be amalgamated into some sort of 
unity; the kind of unity that makes mutual coexistence (and mutually beneficial 
coexistence) possible? How, in brief, is it possible to construct and maintain a society? 

Procedural knowledge, generated in the course of heroic behavior, is not organized 
and integrated within the group and the individual as a consequence of simple 
accumulation. Procedure “a,” appropriate in situation one, and procedure “b,” appropriate 
in situation two, may clash in mutual violent opposition in situation three. Under such 
conditions intrapsychic or interpersonal conflict necessarily emerges. When such 
antagonism arises, moral revaluation becomes necessary. As a consequence of such 
revaluation, behavioral options are brutally rank-ordered, or, less frequently, entire moral 
systems are devastated, reorganized and replaced. This organization and reorganization 
occurs as a consequence of “war,” in its concrete, abstract, intrapsychic and interpersonal 
variants. In the most basic case, an individual is rendered subject to an intolerable 
conflict, as a consequence of the perceived (affective) incompatibility of two or more 
apprehended outcomes of a given behavioral procedure. In the purely intrapsychic 
sphere, such conflict often emerges when attainment of what is desired presently 
necessarily interferes with attainment of what is desired (or avoidance of what is feared) 
in the future. Permanent satisfactory resolution of such conflict (between temptation and 
“moral purity,” for example) requires the construction of an abstract moral system, 



Maps of Meaning 189 


powerful enough to allow what an occurrence signifies for the future to govern reaction 
to what it signifies now. Even that construction, however, is necessarily incomplete when 
considered only as an “intrapsychic” phenomena. The individual, once capable of 
coherently integrating competing motivational demands in the private sphere, nonetheless 
remains destined for conflict with the other, in the course of the inevitable 
transformations of personal experience. This means that the person who has come to 
terms with him- or herself—at least in principle—is still subject to the affective 
dysregulation inevitably produced by interpersonal interaction. It is also the case that 
such subjugation is actually indicative of insufficient “intrapsychic” organization, as 
many basic “needs” can only be satisfied through the cooperation of others. 

The problems posed by the “future self,” whose still-potential existence has to be 
taken into account and used to govern action in the present, are very similar to those 
posed by the existence of others, whose affective responses are equally hypothetical (as 
they cannot be experienced directly, but only inferred). The properly socialized 
individual has been trained to grant this “abstract other” (future self and other person) 
ontological status equivalent to the experienced self, however—has been trained to use 
the existence of that other as a guide to “proper action and interpretation” in the present. 
This means that for the social being all individual actions come to be evaluated with 
regard to their likely current and future consequences, for the self and for the others likely 
affected. Such evaluation may take place directly—that is, as a matter of “conscious 
deliberation”; alternatively, the well-socialized individual may act “as if’ he or she 
thought the matter through, by remaining in well-trodden moral pathways (which have 
been established under the cumulative historical pressure produced by the necessity of 
maintaining intrapsychic and social order). The more implicit information extant in the 
latter case is “placed there” as a consequence of the exchange of emotional information, 
attendant upon given action patterns, in the potential absence of explicit rationale: 
someone is informed by subtle scornful gesture, for example, that a given (theoretically 
pleasurable and even evidently harmless) behavior is “just not done,” which means that it 
is regarded by custom as harmful, to the self and others, in some manner not easily 
observed but still important. It is such arbitrary rules that constitute the implicit 
information coded in societal structure—information not necessarily placed there by 
rational means, not necessarily “comprehended” in any declarative sense; but information 
that is nonetheless transmissible and representable as a consequence of extended-term 
pattern recognition and analysis. 

The “stories” by which individuals live (which comprise their schemas of 
interpretation, which guide their actions, which regulate their emotions) are therefore 
emergent structures shaped by the necessity of organizing competing internal biological 
demands, over variable spans of time, in the presence of others, faced with the same fate. 
This similarity of demand (constrained by physiological structure) and context 
(constrained by social reality) produces similarity of response. It is this similarity of 
response, in turn, that is at the base of the emergent “shared moral viewpoint” that 
accounts for cross-cultural similarity in myth. This means, by the way, that such “shared 
viewpoints” refer to something real, at least insofar as emergent properties are granted 
reality (and most of the things that we regard without question as real are precisely such 
emergent properties).

The reactions of a hypothetical firstborn child to his or her newborn sibling may serve 
as concrete illustration of the interactions between the individual, the interpersonal and 
the social. The elder sibling may be drawn positively to the newborn by natural affiliative 
tendencies and curiosity. At the same time, however, the new arrival may be receiving a 
substantial amount of parental attention, sometimes in preference to the older child. This 
shift of parental care often produces frustration, manifested in aggressive behavior, on the 
part of the supplanted sibling. The older child will therefore become conflicted, 
internally, in consequence of his affection for the new family member, curiosity about its 
nature, and irritation at the creature’s existence, demands and influence on the (once) 
predictable interactions of the familial social unit. The protective attitude of the parents, 
who restrict aggression on the part of the elder child, further complicates things—draws 
the additional requirements of the social unit into the already difficult situation. 

How is the child to resolve his conflicts? He must build himself a personality to deal 
with his new sibling (must become a proper big brother). This means that he might 
subordinate his aggression to the fear, guilt and shame produced by parental adjudication 
on behalf of the baby. This will mean that he will at least “act like a human being” 
around the baby, in the direct presence of his parents. He might also learn to act as if the 
aggressive reaction motivated by his shift in status is less desirable, in total, than the 
affiliative response. His as if stance may easily be bolstered by intelligent shift in 
interpretation: he may reasonably gain from his younger sibling some of the attention he 
is no longer paid by parents—if he is diligent and genuine in his attempts to be friendly. 
He might also develop some more independent interests, suitable to his new position as 
relatively mature family member. In the former, simplest case (when he subordinates his 
aggression to fear), the child rank-orders his motivational states, as manifested in 
behavior. In the latter, revolutionary situation, the child restructures the implicit 
presumptions that originally gave rise to the conflict. Either way, the situation is resolved 
(restoried) in the course of what might reasonably be described as an internal war— 
accompanied, inevitably, by intense outbursts of pain, fear and rage. The personality that 
emerges as a consequence of such a war is, at least in the revolutionary case, something 
“more like the hero” than the personality that existed prior to the change in environmental 
circumstances. 

The situation of marriage provides an additional illustrative example, relevant to the 
adult situation. In marriage, the desire for individual self-expression is necessarily limited 
by the desire for maintenance of the intimate interpersonal relationship, and for adoption 
of the “respectable” social role that constitutes such maintenance. The male, bachelor no 
more, may attempt to carry on his premarital mode of activity, more purely dependent on 
personal desire and whim, limited by whatever minimal necessary social obligations he 
may have acquired previously. Soon he will discover, if he has taken an appropriately 
assertive partner, that his (heretofore individualistic) wishes and desires produce conflict 
in his married life, manifested in interpersonal strife and consequent emotional 
dysregulation. 

The clashes that commonly accompany establishment of a permanent affiliative 
relationship arise as a result of the incompatibility of (implicit and explicit) individual 
moral presumptions and propositions, in the interpersonal sphere (arise as a result of an 
interpersonal “war of implicit gods”). Such clashes may be resolved in a variety of 
manners. One partner may, through judicious application of physical or psychological 



Maps of Meaning 191 


punishment, render the other impotent, so to speak, and subordinate—permanently 
frustrated, miserable, anxious and hostile. The marriage may thus lose much of its value 
or may dissolve altogether. This does not constitute a “solution”—merely regression, in 
the face of emergent anomaly, to the preexistent “single personality.” Alternatively, each 
partner may determine to take “the other” into serious consideration, and rearrange 
personal behavior (and emergent value) accordingly. This process will not occur without 
capacity to engage in open conflict (to exchange often distressing information, 
realistically speaking) or without the courage to voluntarily submit to the experience of 
negative emotion [including anxiety, guilt and shame, as previously “unconscious” 
(implicit) faults and insufficiencies come to light]. The mythic subjugation of the partners 
in a marriage to the higher authority of Christ, the culture hero, ritually represented in the 
Christian marriage ceremony, constitutes symbolic aid to this process. 334 

Voluntary subordination of the personal wishes of both individuals to the higher moral 
order embodied in the action patterns of the Christian savior, for example, means implicit 
agreement about the nature of transcendent principles that can be referred to when 
mediation between incompatible desires and presuppositions becomes necessary. This 
means that the “personality” constituted by the “mystical union” of both partners in the 
marriage is supposed to approximate Christ—to stand as an entity superordinate to the 
“less complete” individuals who compose the “married couple.” This process of 
voluntary subordination “to a higher deity” parallels the extended transpersonal historical 
process described in the Enuma elish, with regard to the ascendance of Marduk. Through 
conflict (and cooperation), within the “container” of the marriage, new moralities are 
created—new patterns of behavior (and assumption and expectation) manifested and 
internally represented. This process may be guided to a healthy outcome through mutual 
participation in community-sponsored religious ritual. Alternatively, individuals may 
succeed, or fail, in isolation. 

Motivational states compete for predominance in the present, in the purely subjective 
and interpersonal spheres, and also compete across time. What is fear-provoking now 
may be tolerated because it means less punishment (or less fear, or more pleasure, or 
more hope) in the future, insofar as intelligence or custom can make that judgment; 
similarly, the social group and the additional pressure it produces is tolerated because the 
group constitutes the most effective currently imaginable solution to the problem of 
adaptation. This group, the current embodiment of human custom, is the consequence of 
a battle between various ways of being fought across generations. 

Although the “battle for predominance” that characterizes exchange of morally 
relevant information can easily be imagined as a war (and is often fought out in the guise 
of genuine war), it is more frequently the case that it manifests itself as a struggle 
between “beliefs.” In the latter case, it loss of faith, rather than life, that determines the 
outcome of the battle. Human beings can substitute loss of faith for death partly because 
they are capable of abstractly constructing their “territories” (making beliefs out of them) 
and of abstractly abandoning those territories once they are no longer tenable. Animals, 
less capable of abstraction, are also able to lose face, rather than life, although they “act 
out” this loss, in behavioral routines, rather than in verbal or imagistic battles (rather than 
through argument). It is the capacity to “symbolically capitulate” and to “symbolically 
destroy” that in large part underlies the ability of individual animals to organize 
themselves into social groups (which require a hierarchical organization) and to maintain 



Maps of meaning 192 


and update those groups once established. Much the same can be said for human beings 
(who also engage in abstract war, at the procedural level, as well as in real war and 
argumentation). 

Strong ideas produce profound displays of faith, or, alternatively put: unshakeable 
displays of faith are indicative of the strength of an idea. The strength of an integrative 
idea, or its preabstract procedural equivalent, might be considered reasonably measured 
by its capacity to inhibit competing impulses—especially those motivated by fear. 
Dominance displays in groups of primates and other complex higher-order social animals 
provide a useful example of this. Most dominance disputes are settled before escalation 
into physical aggression. It is the animal most capable of holding its ground in the face of 
challenge—despite threat, regardless of fear—that is the likely victor in the case of such a 
dispute. The capacity to maintain territorial position when challenged is therefore 
indicative of the degree to which intrapsychic state is integrated with regard to current 
motivation (which means, indicative of how “convinced” a given animal is that it can 
[should] hold its ground). This integration constitutes power— charisma, in the human 
realm—made most evident in behavioral display. The certainty with which a position is 
held (whether it is a territorial position, dominance hierarchy niche, or abstract notion)— 
insofar as this can be inferred from observable behavior, such as absence of fear— 
constitutes a valid indication of the potential integrative potency of that position; 
constitutes an indication of how much the creature who is holding the position believes in 
the rightness (justice, goodness) of his or her stance. The integrative strength of beliefs of 
this type can be determined, accurately, through challenge (since the capacity to 
withstand challenge is dependent upon that strength). This means that the ability of those 
who hold an idea to withstand challenge without wavering constitutes one [nonempirical 
(?)] affective criterion for determination of the truth of that idea—or at least of its 
intrapsychic utility. Hence the power of the martyr, and the unwillingness of even 
modern totalitarian to allow their enemies to make public sacrifices of themselves. 

Rank-ordering of behavior in terms of comparative utility is (procedural, episodic or 
semantic) judgment rendered upon value. Such judgment constitutes a decision about the 
“nature of good and evil,” from the mythic or narrative viewpoint. Such determinations 
of value are decisions whose function is organization of future-oriented present 
individual behavior, manifested in the (inevitably) social context, in accordance with the 
wisdom of past experience. The content of mythically transmitted behavioral schemas 
and their value-predicated arrangements generally remains implicit, outside the domain 
of descriptive comprehensibility, because of their exceedingly complex structure, which 
evolved through the action of primarily nondeclarative evolutionary processes. The 
emotional upheaval caused by simultaneous application of noncommensurate behavioral 
or interpretive strategies provides the impetus for the organization of those strategies. 
Such organization emerges as a result of the “struggle for dominion,” intrapsychically or 
interpersonally—emerges in consequence of a quasi-Darwinian straggle for survival. 

Over the course of centuries, the actions of ancestral heroes, imitated directly and then 
represented in myth, become transformed, simplified, streamlined and quickened— 
reduced as it were ever more precisely to their “Platonic” forms. Culture is therefore the 
sum total of surviving historically determined hierarchically arranged behaviors and 
second- and third-order abstract representations, and more: it is the integration of these, 
in the course of endless social and intrapsychic conflict, into a single pattern of 



Maps of Meaning 193 


behavior—a single system of morality, simultaneously governing personal conduct, 
interpersonal interaction and imagistic/semantic description of such. This pattern is the 
“corporeal ideal” of the culture, its mode of transforming the unbearable present into the 
desired future, its guiding force, its central personality. This personality, expressed in 
behavior, is first embodied in the king or emperor, socially (where it forms the basis for 
“sovereignty”). Abstractly represented—imitated, played, ritualized, and storied—it 
becomes something ever more psychological. This embodied and represented “cultural 
character” is transmitted through the generations, transmuting in form, but not in 
essence—transmitted by direct instruction, through imitation, and as a consequence of the 
human ability to incorporate personality features temporarily disembodied in narrative. 

The “integrative conflict” of complex ideas, giving rise to the “central character of 
culture,” appears as a process extending over untold centuries. This process represents 
itself, in mythology, as the “battle of the gods in heaven,” which Eliade has described as 
the “conflict between divine generations.” 335 Eliade discusses Efittite/Hurrian and 
Canaanite mythology (circa 1740-1200 B.C.) and its relationship to similar myths in 
ancient Phoenicia and elsewhere. In the Hittite theogony, the relative sovereignty of the 
gods was determined by war between them: 

The initial episode, “Kingship in Eleaven,” explains the succession of the 
first gods. In the beginning, Alalu was king, and Anu, the most important 
of the gods, bowed before him and served him. But after nine years Anu 
attacked and vanquished him. Then Alalu took refuge in the subterranean 
world, and Kumarbi became the new sovereign’s servant. Nine years 
passed, and Kumarbi in his turn attacked Anu. The latter fled, flying into 
the sky, but Kumarbi pursued him, caught him by the feet, and threw him 
to the ground, after biting his “loins.” Since he was laughing and rejoicing 
over his exploit, Anu told him that he had been impregnated. Kumarbi 
spat out what was still in his mouth, but a part of Anu’s virility entered his 
body, and he became big with three gods. The rest of the text is badly 
mutilated, but it is presumed that Anu’s “children,” with Teshub, the 
storm god leading them, make war on Kumarbi and dethrone him. 336 

Eliade continues, drawing upon Philo of Byblos’ archaic Phoenician History. 

The first sovereign [Phoenician] god was Elioun (in Greek, Elypistos, 

“The Most ETigh”), corresponding in the EIurrian/Hittite mythology to 
Alalu. From his union with Bruth there came into the world Uranus 
(corresponding to Anu) and Ge (Gaea). In their turn, these two 
engendered four sons, the first of whom, El (or Kronos), corresponds to 
Kumarbi. As the result of a quarrel with his wife, Uranus tries to destroy 
his progeny, but El forges a saw (or lance?) for himself, drives out his 
father, and becomes the sovereign. Finally, Baal (representing the fourth 
generation and corresponding to Teshub and Zeus) obtains the 
sovereignty; exceptionally, he obtains it without combat. 

It is important to emphasize at once the “specialized” and at the same 
time syncretistic character of this myth, and not only in its Hurrian/Hittite 



Maps of meaning 194 


version (in which, besides, there are a number of Sumero-Akkadian 
elements). The Enuma elish 337 likewise presents (1) a series of divine 
generations, (2) the battle of the young gods against the old gods, and (3) 
the victory of Marduk, who thus assumes the sovereignty. 

To sum up: all the myths that recount the conflicts between successive 
generations of gods for the conquest of universal sovereignty justify, on 
the one hand, the exalted position of the last conquering god and, on the 
other hand, explain the present structure of the world and the actual 
condition of humanity. 338 

The “gods” are transpersonal forces, “instinctive” and socially modified, comprising 
universal elements of human experience. The organization of these gods, as a 
consequence of combat, is an abstracted and poetic description of the manner in which 
emergent behavioral patterns and interpretive schemas—moral positions, so to speak— 
fight for predominance, and therefore organize themselves, over the course of time. 

The manner in which a given society has come to organize its behavioral hierarchies is 
implicit in its mode of attributing to, or perceiving value in, “objects” (which is to say, 
implicit in its mode of restricting the meaning manifested by objects to an acceptable 
range and magnitude). The brutally organized consequence of “the battle of the gods” 
constitutes the tradition that structures the intrapsychic hierarchy of values, regulates 
interpersonal interaction, and keeps individual emotion in check (as the consequences of 
individual and social behavior, when guided by tradition, remain predictable). A given 
behavior, manifested in the absence of another being, does not necessarily produce the 
same outcome when it plays itself out in the presence of others. Two children and one toy 
is not the same situation as one child and one toy (because, in a sense, the toy is not the 
same—not from the phenomenological perspective). The behavioral tendencies of 
individuals undergo constant modification in the social situation, because the fact of the 
society in the situation changes the motivational relevance of all the objects in the 
situation. Two children with one toy have to come to an agreement, which is mutual 
modification of behavior, before the toy can be what it is when encountered alone— 
which is tun, rather than trouble. 

The behavioral tendencies of individuals are mimicked action patterns which were 
originally established as a consequence of heroic behavior. The mutual interplay of action 
pat-terns in the social world, however, results in their inevitable modification. Patterns of 
behavior—those motivated by aggression, for example, or love or fear—have a 
transpersonal basis, which accounts, in part, for their personification as gods (or, for their 
existence as gods, from a more liberal interpretive perspective). It is the constant clash of 
these gods that allows for their mutual coexistence and their social organization. A 
number of “gods” might operate simultaneously in the domain of a disputed toy, for 
example (in the unknown territory brought about by the fact of something desirable but 
singular in a social environment). The “god of war” (Ares, say, for the sake of argument) 
might emerge “within” one child, or both—in which case a fight will ensue. The winner, 
assuming there is one, may then be more likely to be warlike, in the future, in a social 
situation characterized by ambiguity. The loser might have other thoughts [may come, for 
example, to be dominated by Pan(ic) when faced with emergent toy-conflict with a 
stranger (may come to cry and withdraw)]. Alternatively, in the optimistic case, one or 



Maps of Meaning 195 


both children may negotiate a fair settlement, so both are satisfied, and neither hurt. The 
“negotiation” of a “fair settlement” presupposes that each child treats the other as an 
“object of value”—that is, as one who must be taken into account in the course of 
behavioral decisions. This taking into account of others is recognition of their implicit 
worth—their “basic human rights”—as (mythologically equivalent) community 
members. Such recognition, acted out before it is understood, provides the basis for the 
organization of societies, on a foundation other than that of force. Despite the lack of 
explicit understanding, however, the fact of negotiation is indicative of identity with the 
hero (the eternal “means to peace”) as the hero is divine peacemaker, in one of his many 
guises. The emergence of negotiation, during time of dispute, is therefore both 
“spontaneous incarnation of the savior,” and source of information for the derivation of 
stories about the nature of the hero (which are useful for future reference). 

In the case of children engaged in a dispute over toys: a parent who allows the 
stronger child preferential access to the desired object is making the moral claim that the 
thing—and the aggressive desire for the thing, which may well be conflated with the 
thing—is something of higher value than the emotional state or physical well-being of the 
defeatable other. Alternatively, the parent may require the children to mediate between 
their competing demands without reverting to “might makes right,” and to construct for 
themselves a hierarchy of value governing behavior in the chaotic situation defined by 
the mutually desirable but singular toy. It is the sum total of such interactions, conducted 
in once unexplored territory, hierarchically organized, that come to compose culture. 

In the case of broader society: the “meaning” of an object—that is, the significance of 
that object for emotional regulation and behavioral output—is determined by the social 
consequences of behaviors undertaken and inferences drawn in its presence. Thus internal 
motivational forces vie for predominance under the influence of social control. The 
valence of erotic advances made by a given woman, for example—which is to say, 
whether her behavior invokes the “goddess of love” or the “god of fear”—will depend on 
her current position in a given social hierarchy. If she is single and acting in context, she 
may be considered desirable; if she is the intoxicated wife of a large and dangerous man, 
by contrast, she may be placed in the category of “something best run away from 
quickly.” 

When exploration culminates in punishment, to take another example, the exploratory 
tendency matched to that situation will come under the inhibitory control of fear. When 
this subordination occurs as a consequence of the investigation of a natural object, the 
interpretation would be that something has been learned about the nature of the world 
(about that part of it which is dangerous, at any rate). The process is extended complexly 
in the social sphere. A motivated pattern of action (even the motivated state itself) may 
come under the inhibitory control of fear, because its behavioral expression within the 
social community results in social rejection (or other interpersonally mediated 
punishment). Thus it could be said that the structure of the internal motivational state 
reflects the consequences of behavior undertaken in the nature and social worlds—or, 
more particularly, that there is an isomorphic relationship between the state of the 
internal representation of motivational states and the external, social world. It is for this 
reason that a political state and a psychological state can be in some sense regarded as 
identical (and why individuals come so easily to identify with their social groupings). 




Maps of meaning 196 


The culturally determined meaning of an object—apprehended, originally, as an 
aspect of the object—is in fact in large part implicit information about the nature of the 
current dominance hierarchy, which has been partially transformed into an abstract 
hypothesis about the relative value of things (including the self and others). Who owns 
what, for example, determines what things signify, and who owns what is dominance- 
hierarchy dependent. What an object signifies is determined by the value placed upon it, 
manifested in terms of the (socially determined) system of promises, rewards, threats and 
punishments associated with exposure to, contact with, and use or misuse of that object. 
This is in turn determined by the affective significance of the object (its relevance, or lack 
thereof, to the attainment of a particular goal), in combination with its scarcity or 
prevalence, and the power (or lack thereof) of those who judge its nature. In keeping with 
this observation, the existentialist psychotherapist Ludwig Binswanger states: 

All “metamorphoses of the egoistic in social instincts” and thus, properly 
said, all metamorphoses of evil into good drives and dispositions, occur, 
according to Freud, under compulsion. “Originally, i.e., in human history 
[such transformations occurred] only under external compulsion, but they 
[occurred] through the bringing into the world of hereditaiy dispositions 
for such transformations and also through their perpetuation and 
reinforcement ‘during the life of the individual himself.’” Indeed, this 
whole “development” takes the direction in which external compulsion is 
introjected, and which, in the case of the human Super-ego, is completely 
absorbed. This transformation occurs, as we know, “by the admixture of 
erotic components”: “we learn to value being loved as an advantage by 
virtue of which we may do without other advantages.” Culture is thus 
“attained through the renunciation of instinctual gratifications and 
furthered by every new development which serves the purposes of 
renunciation.” 

In all this, we stand before the pure specimen of homo natura: bodily 
instinct, the gaining of pleasure (sacrificing a lesser for a greater gain), 
inhibition because of compulsion or pressures from society (the prototype 
being the family), a developmental history in the sense of ontogenetic and 
phylogenetic transformations of outer into inner compulsions, and the 
inheritance of these transformations. 339 

Whether a particular behavioral strategy (planned or exploratory) produces a positive or 
negative outcome in a particular situation depends, for social animals, on the nature of the 
social environment in which it is manifested. Any given “object” capable of eliciting 
behavior is necessarily part of a social context, among social animals; that social context 
plays an important role in determining the value of the object. It is social determination 
of value that helps make an object neutral, dangerous, promising or satisfying—in large 
part, independently of the “objective” properties of the item in question. The socially 
determined affective significance of the object is “naturally” experienced as an aspect of 
the object—which is to say that the charisma radiating from an Elvis Presley guitar is 
“part” of the guitar. This means that the meaning of objects in a social context is actually 



Maps of Meaning 197 


information about the structure of that social context [as well as “part” of the object (its 
“magic”) from the mythological or narrative perspective]. 

Identification of the context-dependent meaning of objects in the social environment, 
which is determination of the behavioral patterns whose manifestation is appropriate in 
that situation, means encounter with cultural structure designed to bring predictability to 
the ongoing flow of events. Participation in the processes and representations comprising 
that structure (that is, adoption of social identity) means heightened capacity to predict 
behavior of self and other—and, therefore, capacity to regulate emotion through the ebb 
and flow of life. Much potential unpredictability remains “constrained” by the shared 
identity constituting culture. This social identity, which is a story about how things are 
and how they should be—“things” including the self and the other—provides the 
framework that constrains the otherwise unbearable a priori motivational significance of 
the ultimately unknowable experiential object. The unknown surrounds the individual, 
like the ocean surrounds an island, and produces affect, compels behavior, whenever it 
shows its terrible but promising face. Culture is constructed in spite of (in cooperation 
with, in deference to) this omnipresent force, and serves as a barrier, quelling emotion, 
providing protection against exposure to the unbearable face of God. 

It is the conservative aspect of society that ensures that the past, as presently 
reincarnated and remembered, continues to serve as ultimate source of moral virtue and 
emotional protection. This remembered past is the mythical Father, echoed more 
abstractly in one “person” of the Christian Trinity. The power of the past is given due 
recognition in the ritual of ancestor worship, for example, which is motivated by desire to 
remain “in communication” with the dead (to retain the wisdom, protective power and 
guiding hand of the dead). Such motivation comprised a force sufficient to give impetus 
to the construction of megaliths—massive stone “testaments to the past”—in a 
geographical zone stretching from western and northern Europe, through the Middle East, 
into Tibet and Korea, from 4000 B.C. to the present day. 340 The megaliths, like the 
modern necropolises or cemeteries, are sites of the dead, monuments and aid to memory 
and the continuity of culture. Eliade states: 

Megaliths have a relation to certain ideas concerning existence after death. 

The majority of them are built in the course of ceremonies intended to 
defend the soul during its journey into the beyond; but they also insure an 
internal postexistence, both to those who raise them during their own 
lifetime and to those for whom they are built after death. In addition, 
megaliths constitute the unrivaled connection between the living and the 
dead; they are believed to perpetuate the magical virtues of those who 
constructed them or for whom they were constructed, thus insuring the 
fertility of men, cattle, and harvests. 341 


also 


By virtue of the megalithic constructions, the dead enjoy an exceptional 
power; however, since communication with the ancestors is ritually 
assured, this power can be shared by the living.... What characterizes the 
megalithic religions is the fact that the ideas of perenniality and of 



Maps of meaning 198 


continuity between life and death are apprehended through the exaltation 
of the ancestors as identified, or associated, with the stones , 342 

What is cast in stone, so to speak, is remembered, and what is remembered (in the 
absence of permanent literate means of communication) is the value of culture, the 
significance of the discoveries of all those whose exisence preceded the present time. The 
past, made metaphorically present in the form of stone, is the mythical ancestor-hero—is 
Osiris, the founder of the community. In traditional communities, awe-inspired imitation 
of the actions of that primary personage, modified by time and abstracted representation, 
retains primary and potent force (even in revolutionary cultures such as our own). The 
action of the preexperimental man consists of ritual duplication and simultaneous 
observation of taboo—action bounded by custom. When such a man endeavors to 
produce a particular end, he follows an exemplary pattern. This pattern was established 
by his ancestral progenitors in a time subsuming all time, and in a “divine” (actually, 
communitarian-intrapsychic) space. His tradition, after all, is not merely the force of the 
past—it is that force, as it is exists and is represented in the present. What is remembered 
takes on representation as a pattern—as that pattern of behavior characteristic of the 
culture-creating “supernatural beings” who lived prior to living recollection. This pattern 
is traditional behavior, as established and organized by those who were capable of 
originating adaptation—or, it could be said, as established and organized by the immortal 
and central human spirit who constantly battles the fear of death and creates the 
conditions that promote life: 

For the man of traditional societies everything significant—that is, 
everything creative and powerful—that has ever happened took place in 
the beginning, in the Time of myths. 

In one sense it could almost be said that for the man of archaic 
societies history is “closed”; that it exhausted itself in the few stupendous 
events of the beginning. By revealing the different modes of deep-sea 
fishing to the Polynesians at the beginning of Time, the mythical Hero 
exhausted all the possible forms of that activity at a single stroke; since 
then, whenever they go fishing, the Polynesians repeat the exemplary 
gesture of the mythical Hero, that is, they imitate a transhuman model. 

But, properly considered, this history preserved in the myths is closed 
only in appearance. If the man of primitive societies had contented 
himself with forever imitating the few exemplary gestures revealed by the 
myths, there would be no explaining the countless innovations he has 
accepted during the course of Time. No such thing as an absolutely closed 
primitive society exists. We know of none that has not borrowed some 
cultural elements from outside; none that, as the result of these 
borrowings, has not changed at least some aspects of its institutions; none 
that, in short, has had no history. But, in contrast to modern society, 
primitive societies have accepted all innovations as so many “revelations,” 
hence as having a superhuman origin. The objects or weapons that were 
borrowed, the behavior patterns and institutions that were imitated, the 
myths or beliefs that were assimilated, were believed to be charged with 



Maps of Meaning 199 


magico-religious power; indeed, it was for this reason that they had been 
noticed and the effort made to acquire them. Nor is this all. These 
elements were adopted because it was believed that the Ancestors had 
received the first cultural revelations from Supernatural Beings. And since 
traditional societies have no historical memory in the strict sense, it took 
only a few generations, sometimes even less, for a recent innovation to be 
invested with all the prestige of the primordial revelations. 

In the last analysis we could say that, though they are “open” to 
history, traditional societies tend to project every new acquisition into the 
primordial Time, to telescope all events in the same atemporal horizon of 
the mythical beginning. ' 4 ' 

The social structure that emerges, over time, as a consequence of the “battle of the gods,” 
might be most accurately likened to a personality (to the personality adopted by all who 
share the same culture). It is in fact the personality of “the dead heroes of the past” (the 
“hero as previously realized”) and is most frequently symbolized by the figure of the 
Great Father, simultaneous personification of order and tyranny. Culture binds nature. 
The archetypal Great Father protects his children from chaos; holds back the 
precosmogonic water from which everything was derived, to which everything will 
return; and serves as progenitor of the hero. The protective capacity of benevolent 
tradition, embodied in the form of political order, constitutes a common 
mythological/narrative theme. This may be illustrated for our purposes through 
consideration and analysis of a Polish folktale: The Jolly Tailor Who Became King. 344 
Nitechka, the hero of the story, is a simple tailor. Fie courageously aids a wounded 
gypsy—that is, acts humanely toward an outsider, a stranger, a personified “emissary of 
chaos.” In return, the gypsy provides him with “redemptive” information—informs him 
that if he walks westward, he will become king. Fie acquires a scarecrow—“the Count”— 
as a companion, and has a number of adventures with him. Finally, the two travelers 
arrive at the town of Pacanow and observe the proceedings there—in great astonishment: 

All around the town it was sunshiny and pleasant; but over Pacanow the 
rain poured from the sky as from a bucket. 

“I won’t go in there,” said the Scarecrow, “because my hat will get 
wet.” 

“And even I do not wish to become King of such a wet kingdom,” said 
the Tailor. 

Just then the townspeople spied them and rushed toward them, led by 
the Burgomaster riding on a shod goat. 

“Dear Sirs,” they said, “perhaps you can help us.” 

“And what has happened to you?” asked Nitechka. 

“Deluge and destruction threaten us. Our King died a week ago, and 
since that time a terrible rain has come down upon our gorgeous town. We 
can’t even make fires in our houses, because so much water runs through 
the chimneys. We will perish, honorable Sirs!” 

“It is too bad,” said Nitechka very wisely. 



Maps of meaning 200 


“Oh, very bad! And we are most sorry for the late King’s daughter, as 
the poor thing can’t stop crying and this causes even more water.” 

“That makes it still worse,” replied Nitechka, still more wisely. 

“Help us, help us!” continued the Burgomaster. “Do you know the 
immeasurable reward the Princess promised to the one who stops the rain? 

She promised to marry him and then he will become King.” 

The basic plot is established. The tailor—he who clothes, mends and ties—is the hero. 
Although simple (poor in outward appearance, humble, willing to take risks, helpful and 
kind), he has the capacity to become King. He journeys to a town threatened by a deluge 
(by chaos, in the guise of “return of the primordial waters”). This deluge began after the 
recent death of the King. The kings daughter—benevolent (young, beautiful, good) 
counterpart to the forces of the negative feminine (the unstoppable rain)—appears willing 
to unite with whomever saves the kingdom. She represents the potential embedded in 
voluntarily confronted chaos (yet is assimilated to her primordial partner, the Great 
Mother, by her “rainlike” tears). 

Nitechka realizes that he must bring back “pleasant weather.” He ponders the situation 
for three long days. Finally, he is granted a revelation: 

“I know where the rain comes from!” 

“Where from?” 

“From the sky” [that is, from “heaven”]. 

“Eh!” grumbled the Scarecrow. “I know that too. Surely it doesn’t fall 
from the bottom to the top, but the other way around.” 

“Yes,” said Nitechka, “but why does it fall over the town only, and not 
elsewhere?” 

“Because elsewhere is nice weather.” 

“You’re stupid, Mr. Count,” said the Tailor. “But tell me, how long has 
it rained?” 

“They say since the King died.” 

“So you see! Now I know everything! The King was so great and 
mighty that when he died and went to Heaven he made a huge hole in the 
sky.” 

“Oh, oh, true!” 

The death of the King—who is the ritual model for emulation, the figure who brings 
order or predictability to interpersonal interaction undertaken among his subjects—means 
potential dissolution of security and protection. The King’s death (his “return to heaven,” 
or to the kingdom of the dead) is equivalent to the fracturing of a protective wall. The 
unknown, from which his subjects were protected, pours through the breached wall. The 
kingdom risks inundation: 

“Through the hole the rain poured and it will pour until the end of the 
world [emphasis added] if the hole isn’t sewed up!” 

Count Scarecrow looked at him in amazement. 

“In all my life I have never seen such a wise Tailor,” he said. 



Maps of Meaning 201 


Nitechka orders the townspeople to bring “all the ladders in the town,” to “tie them 
together,” and to “lean them against the sky.” He ascends the ladder, with a hundred 
needles, threading one: 

Count Scarecrow stayed at the bottom and unwound the spool on which 
there was a hundred miles of thread. 

When Nitechka got to the very top he saw that there was a huge hole in 
the sky, a hole as big as the town. A torn piece of the sky hung down, and 
through this hole the water poured. 

This narrative fragment is particularly interesting, as it is apparent that the water is 
coming, somehow, from “behind” the sky. The sky is utilized in mythology, in general, 
as a “masculine” symbol (at least the day sky) and tends to be assimilated to the same 
natural category as “the king.” It appears to be damage to the general structure of the 
“masculine” sky, produced by the death of a specific king, that constitutes the breach 
through which precosmogonic material (in the form of water) is able to pour through. 
The “death of the king” and the “breach in the sky” is equivalent in meaning to the death 
of Apsu, in the Enuma elish —the death that heralded the reappearance of Tiamat. In this 
tale, however, Nitechka “repairs the structure of the sky” (an act equivalent to the 
reconstitution of Osiris) instead of directly battling the “dragon of chaos”: 

So he went to work and sewed and sewed for two days. His fingers grew 
stiff and he became very tired but he did not stop. When he had finished 
sewing he pressed out the sky with the iron and then, exhausted, went 
down the ladders. 

Once more the sun shone over Pacanow. Count Scarecrow almost went 
mad with joy, as did all the other inhabitants of the town. The Princess 
wiped her eyes that were almost cried out, and throwing herself on 
Nitechka’s neck, kissed him affectionately. 

The “creative union” of the hero with the “benevolent aspect of the unknown” is 
evidently approaching. 

Nitechka was very happy. He looked around, and there were the 
Burgomaster and Councilmen bringing him a golden scepter and a 
gorgeous crown and shouting: 

“Long live King Nitechka! Long live he! Long live he! And let him be 
the Princess’ husband and let him reign happily!” 

So the merry little Tailor reigned happily for a long time, and the rain 
never fell in his kingdom. 

This fairy tale constitutes a specific example of a more general type of story: that is, the 
story of the “god who binds.” 343 The god who binds might be Marduk, who encloses 
Tiamat in a net given to him by his father, Anu—in which case the binding is clearly 
benevolent (even “world-engendering”). Binding may also be conceptualized as the 
prerogative of the sovereign, who binds his “enemies”—that is, those who threaten the 



Maps of meaning 202 


stability of the kingdom—with cords, ropes and legal strictures. Binding brings order, in 
short, but too much order can be dangerous. The closing line of The Jolly Tailor informs 
us that rain never falls in the newly established kingdom. While this might sound like a 
happy ending to those who have been recently inundated with water, it isn’t so suitable a 
trick if it engenders a drought. We may turn to another literary example, to illustrate this 
point. 

In the famous children’s novel A Wrinkle in Time, a small boy with magical powers 
becomes inhabited by a powerful patriarchal extraterrestrial spirit, while trying to rescue 
his father from “dark powers” threatening the universe. While possessed, this boy, 
Charles Wallace, remarks to his sister: 

“You’ve got to stop fighting and relax. Relax and be happy. Oh, Meg, if 
you’d just relax you’d realize that all our troubles are over. You don’t 
understand what a wonderful place we’ve come to. You see, on this planet 
everything is in perfect order because everybody has learned to relax, to 
give in, to submit. All you have to do is look quietly and steadily into the 
eyes of our good friend, here, for he is our friend, dear sister, and he will 
take you in as he has taken me.” 346 

Everyone who inhabits the state dominated by “the good friend” behaves in a 
programmatic and identical manner. Anyone who differs is “adjusted,” painfully, or 
eliminated. There is no space for disorder of any type: 

Charles Wallace’s strange, monotonous voice ground against her ears. 

“Meg, you’re supposed to have some mind. Why do you think we have 
wars at home? Why do you think people get confused and unhappy? 
Because they all live their own, separate, individual lives. I’ve been trying 
to explain to you in the simplest possible way that [in this state] 
individuals have been done away with.... [here there is] ONE mind. It’s 
IT. And that’s why everybody is so happy and efficient....” 

“Nobody suffers here,” Charles intoned. “Nobody is ever unhappy.” 347 

The (necessary) meaning-constraint typical of a given culture is a consequence of 
uniformity of behavior, imposed by that culture, toward objects and situations. The push 
toward uniformity is a primary characteristic of the “patriarchal” state (as everyone who 
acts in the same situation-specific manner has been rendered comfortably “predictable”). 
The state becomes increasingly tyrannical, however, as the pressure for uniformity 
increases. As the drive toward similarity becomes extreme, everyone becomes the “same” 
person—that is, imitation of the past becomes total. All behavioral and conceptual 
variability is thereby forced from the body politic. The state then becomes truly static. 
paralyzed or deadened, turned to stone, in mythological language. Lack of variability in 
action and ideation renders society and the individuals who compose it increasingly 
vulnerable to precipitous “environmental” transformation (that is, to an involuntary influx 
of “chaotic” changes). It is possible to engender a complete social collapse by constantly 
resisting incremental change. It is in this manner that the gods become displeased with 
their creation, man—and his willful stupidity—and wash away the world. The necessity 



Maps of Meaning 203 


for interchange of information between “known” and “unknown” means that the state 
risks its own death by requiring an excess of uniformity. This risk is commonly given 
narrative representation as “the senescence and frailty of the old King,” or as “the King’s 
mortal illness, brought on by lack of ‘water’ (which is “precosmogonic chaos,” in its 
positive aspect).” Such “ideas” are well illustrated in the Brothers Grimm fairy tale The 
Water of Life : 348 

There once was a king who was so ill that it was thought impossible his 
life could be saved. He had three sons, and they were all in great distress 
on his account, and they went into the castle gardens and wept at the 
thought that he must die. An old man came up to them and asked the 
cause of their grief. They told him that their father was dying, and nothing 
could save him. 

The old man said, “There is only one remedy which I know. It is the 
Water of Life. If he drinks of it he will recover, but it is very difficult to 
find.” 

The two eldest sons determine to seek out the Water of Life, one after the other, after 
gaining their father’s reluctant permission. They both encounter a dwarf, at the beginning 
of their journeys, and speak rudely to him. The dwarf places a curse on them, and they 
each end up stuck fast in a mountain gorge. 

The “youngest son” then sets out. He is humble and has the “right attitude” toward 
what he does not understand. When he encounters the dwarf, therefore—who plays out 
the same role as the gypsy woman in The Jolly Tailor —he receives some valuable 
information: 

“As you have spoken pleasantly to me, and not been haughty like your 
false brothers, I will help you and tell you how to find the Water of Life. 

It flows from a fountain in the courtyard of an enchanted castle. 349 But 
you will never get in unless I give you an iron rod and two loaves of 
bread. With the rod strike three times on the iron gate of the castle and it 
will spring open. Inside you will find two lions with wide-open jaws, but 
if you throw a loaf to each they will be quiet. Then you must make haste 
to fetch the Water of Life before it strikes twelve, or the gates of the castle 
will close, and you will be shut in.” 

The story is making a point: when you don’t know where you are going, it is 
counterproductive to assume that you know how to get there. This point is a specific 
example of a more general moral: Arrogant (“prideful”) individuals presume they know 
who and what is important. This makes them too haughty to pay attention when they are 
in trouble—too haughty, in particular, to attend to those things or people whom they 
habitually hold in contempt. The “drying up of the environment” or the “senescence of 
the king” is a consequence of a too rigid, too arrogant value hierarchy. (“What or who 
can reasonably be ignored” is as much a part of such a hierarchy as “who or what must be 
attended too.”) When trouble arrives, the traditional value hierarchy must be revised. This 
means that the formerly humble and despised may suddenly hold the secret to continued 



Maps of meaning 204 


life 350 —and that those who refuse to admit to their error, like the “elder brothers,” will 
inevitably encounter trouble. The story continues: 

The Prince thanked him, took the rod and the loaves, and set off. When he 
reached the castle all was just as the dwarf had said. At the third knock the 
gates flew open, and when he had pacified the lions with their loaves, he 
walked into the castle. In the great hall he found several enchanted 
princes, and he took the rings from their fingers. He also took a sword and 
a loaf which were lying by them. 

The enchanted princes might be regarded as equivalent, in an important sense, to Osiris, 
the “ancestral hero” whose potential lay unutilized in the underworld after his 
dismemberment by Seth. The enchanted princes are ancestral forces with magical powers 
(like the “dead kings” in the churchyard dream we discussed earlier). The young prince’s 
voyage into the “enchanted castle” is equivalent to a voluntary descent into the dangerous 
kingdom of the dead. His “encounter with the dead ancestors” allows him access to some 
of their power (in the guise of their tools and other belongings). The young prince also 
encounters the “benevolent aspect of the unknown” in the underworld, as might well be 
expected, in her typical personification: 

On passing into the next room he found a beautiful maiden, who rejoiced 
at his coming. She embraced him and said that he had saved her, and if he 
would come back in a year she would marry him. She also told him where 
to find the fountain with the enchanted water, but she said he must make 
haste to get out of the castle before the clock struck twelve. 

Then he went on and came to a room where there was a beautiful bed 
freshly made, and as he was very tired he thought he would take a little 
rest. So he lay down and fell asleep. When he woke it was a quarter to 
twelve. He sprang up in a fright, and ran to the fountain and took some of 
the water in a cup which was lying nearby, and then hurried away. The 
clock struck just as he reached the iron gate, and it banged so quickly that 
it took off a bit of his heel. 

He rejoiced at having got some of the Water of Life, and hastened on 
his homeward journey. He again passed the dwarf, who said when he saw 
the sword and the loaf, “Those things will be of much service to you. You 
will be able to strike down whole armies with the sword, and the loaf will 
never come to an end.” 

The sword and the loaf are the concrete forms taken by the “possibility” released during 
the prince’s heroic journey into the terrible unknown. The sword is a tool which might 
find its use in the battle with negative forces. The loaf is magical, in the same manner as 
the loaves and fishes in the story of Christ’s miraculous provendor: 

In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had 
nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him, and said to them, 



Maps of Meaning 205 


“I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me 
now three days, and have nothing to eat; 

and if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the 
way; and some of them have come a long way.” 

And his disciples answered him, “How can one feed these men with 
bread here in the desert?” 

And he asked them, “How many loaves have you?” They said, 
“Seven.” 

And he commanded the crowd to sit down on the ground; and he took 
the seven loaves, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them 
to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the 
crowd. 

And they had a few small fish; and having blessed them, he 
commanded that these also should be set before them. 

And they ate, and were satisfied; and they took up the broken pieces 
left over, seven baskets full. 

And there were about four thousand people. 

And he sent them away; and immediately he got into the boat with his 
disciples, and went to the district of Dalmanu’tha. 

The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a 
sign from heaven, to test him. 

And he sighed deeply in his spirit, and said, “Why does this generation 
seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign shall be given to this generation.” 

And he left them, and getting into the boat again he departed to the 
other side. 

Now they had forgotten to bring bread; and they had only one loaf with 
them in the boat. 

And he cautioned them, saying, “Take heed, beware of the leaven of 
the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod.” 

And they discussed it with one another, saying, “We have no bread.” 

And being aware of it, Jesus said to them, “Why do you discuss the 
fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are 
your hearts hardened? 

Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do 
you not remember? 

When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets 
full of broken pieces did you take up?” They said to him, “Twelve.” 

“And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets frill of broken 
pieces did you take up?” And they said to him, “Seven.” 

And he said to them, “Do you not yet understand?” (Mark 8:1-21, 

RSV) 

The hero provides “food that never ends.” 

Back to the story: the dwarf tells the prince where his brothers can be found—warning 
him that they have bad hearts and should be left to their fate. The young prince seeks 
them out, nevertheless, rescues them, and tells them everything that has happened. 



Maps of meaning 206 


Then they rode away together and came to a land where famine and war 
were raging. The King thought he would be utterly ruined, so great was 
the destitution. 

The Prince went to him and gave him the loaf, and with it he fed and 
satisfied his whole kingdom. The Prince also gave him his sword, and he 
smote the whole army of his enemies with it, and then he was able to live 
in peace and quiet. Then the Prince took back his sword and his loaf, and 
the three brothers rode on. 

But later they had to pass through two more countries where war and 
famine were raging, and each time the Prince gave his sword and his loaf 
to the King and in this way he saved three kingdoms. 

The tale takes this diversion to help drive home the general utility of what has been 
rescued from the “enchanted kingdom, where the princess dwells.” The treasures released 
from that kingdom have a powerful, protective, revitalizing capacity, no matter where 
they are applied. 

The brothers continue homeward, but the older two deceive the younger on the 
voyage, exchanging the true Water of Life for salt sea water (the “arrogant elder 
brothers” replace the “benevolent aspect of the Great Mother” with her “destructive 
counterpart”). When he arrives at home, the younger son unwittingly gives this poisonous 
water to his father, making him sicker. The older brothers then heal the poisoned king 
with the genuine but stolen water, masking their evil souls with the appearance of 
benevolence, and arrange to have their unfortunate sibling banished and killed. The 
huntsman assigned to do the killing cannot bring himself to do it, however, and allows 
the young prince to escape. Then the tide starts to turn. The previous generous exploits of 
the young prince are revealed, and the old king repents: 

After a time three wagonloads of gold and precious stones came to the 
King for his youngest son. They were sent by the kings who had been 
saved by the Prince’s sword and miraculous loaf, and who now wished to 
show their gratitude. 

Then the old King thought, “What if my son really was innocent?” And 
he said to his people, “If only he were still alive! How sorry I am that I 
ordered him to be killed.” 

“He is still alive,” said the huntsman. “I could not find it in my heart to 
carry out your commands.” And he told the King what had taken place. 

A load fell from the King’s heart on hearing the good news, and he 
sent out a great proclamation to all parts of his kingdom that his son was 
to come home, where he would be received with great favor. 

In the meantime, the princess is preparing for the return of the prince. She 

had caused a road to be made of pure shining gold leading straight to her 
castle, and told her people that whoever came riding straight along it 
would be her true bridegroom, and they were to admit him. But anyone 



Maps of Meaning 207 


who came either on one side of the road or the other would not be the 
right one, and he was not to be let in. 

When the year had almost passed, the eldest Prince thought that he 
would hurry to the Princess, and by giving himself out as her deliverer 
would gain a wife and a kingdom as well. So he rode away, and when he 
saw the beautiful golden road he thought it would be a thousand pities to 
ride upon it, so he turned aside and rode to the right of it. But when he 
reached the gate the people told him that he was not the right bridegroom, 
and he had to go away. 

Soon after the second Prince came, and when he saw the golden road 
he thought it would be a thousand pities for his horse to tread upon it, so 
he turned and rode up on the left of it. But when he reached the gate he 
also was told that he was not the true bridegroom, and like his brother was 
turned away. 

The two elder princes are too bound up in their traditional thoughts of power, wealth and 
glory to concentrate on what is of true importance. Because of their “great respect” for 
the gold that makes up the road, they miss a great opportunity. Their overarching 
admiration for material goods blinds them to the possibility of establishing a relationship 
with the source of all good things—in the guise of the princess (playing a “part” similar 
to that of the Wisdom of Solomon). The youngest son makes no such mistake: 

When the year had quite come to an end, the third Prince came out of the 
wood to ride to his beloved, and through her to forget all his past sorrows. 

So on he went, thinking only of her and wishing to be with her, and he 
never even saw the golden road. His horse cantered right along the middle 
of it, and when he reached the gate it was flung open and the Princess 
received him joyfully, and called him her deliverer and the lord of her 
kingdom. Their marriage was celebrated without delay and with much 
rejoicing. When it was over, she told him that his father had called him 
back and forgiven him. So he went to him and told him everything: how 
his brothers had deceived him, and how they had forced him to keep 
silence. The old King wanted to punish them, but they had taken a ship 
and sailed away over the sea, and never came back as long as they lived. 

The old king is dying for lack of water. He has two elder sons, who could rescue him, but 
they are narrow-minded, traditional, materialistic, selfish and rigid. They lack proper 
“spirit” for the quest. The youngest son, a proper hero, pays attention to what the 
“sensible” ignore, makes a voyage into the unknown, and brings back what is needed. It 
is the journey of the hero that revitalizes the king. Osiris languishes in the underworld— 
regardless of past greatness—without Horus. 

It was the emergence of the heroic stance, mythically represented by man as equal in 
divinity to the unknown or Nature, that provided the precondition for the generation of 
concrete behavioral adaptations to the world of experience. Emergence of heroism meant 
construction of culture: historically determined procedural knowledge and communicable 
description thereof. Construction of culture is creation of the mythic Great and Terrible 



Maps of meaning 208 


Father, tyrant and wise king, as intermediary between the vulnerable individual and the 
overwhelming natural world. This Father is the consequence of voluntary heroic action— 
temporally summed and integrated effect of creative exploratory behavior—as well as 
progenitor of those who take heroic action. This paradoxical child and father of the hero 
is primarily “personality” (procedure) and only secondarily abstracted first- and second- 
order representation thereof (and is most certainly not cumulative description of the 
“objective” world). That this is so can be seen, even today, when the members of 
totalitarian cultures such as the modern North Korean collapse into genuine hysteria as a 
consequence of the death of their leader, who is embodiment of order and determinate 
meaning. Such tendencies are not restricted to those dominated by the totalitarian, either. 
Frye states: 

The function of the king is primarily to represent, for his subjects, the 
unity of their society in an individual form. Even yet Elizabeth II can draw 
crowds wherever she appears, not because there is anything remarkable 
about her appearance, but because she dramatizes the metaphor of society 
as a single “body.” Other societies have other figures, but there seems to 
be a special symbolic eloquence, even a pathos, about the de jure 
monarch, whose position has been acquired by the pure accident of birth, 
and who has no executive power. At the same time most societies have 
done away with monarchical figures; “charismatic” leaders, dictators, and 
the like are almost invariably sinister and regressive; the mystique of 
royalty that Shakespeare’s plays take for granted means little to us now; 
and theologians talking about the “sovereignty” of God risk alienating 
their readers by trying to assimilate the religious life to the metaphors of a 
barbaric and outmoded form of social organization. It is natural that our 
news media should employ the royal metaphor so incessantly in telling us 
about what France or Japan or Mexico “is” doing, as though they were 
individual beings. But the same figure was used in my younger days, to 
my own great annoyance, to boost the prestige of dictators: “Hitler is 
building roads across Germany,” “Mussolini is draining the marshes in 
Italy,” and the like. Those who employed this figure were often 
democratic people who simply could not stop themselves from using the 
royal metaphor. It seems as though the sovereign may be either the most 
attractive of icons or the most dangerous of idols. " 1 

The Great Father is a product of history—or, is history itself, insofar as it is acted out and 
spontaneously remembered—intrapsychically instantiated during the course of 
socialization, and embedded in the social interactions and specific object-meanings that 
make up a given culture. This culturally determined structure—this inhibitory network, 
this intrapsychic representative of the social unit —provides experiential phenomena with 
determinate significance. This determinate significance is restricted meaning—reduced 
from the general meaning of the unknown, per se, to the particular—and not relevance or 
import added to a neutral background. The unknown manifests itself in an intrinsically 
meaningful manner: a manner composed of threat and promise. The specific meaning of 
objects discriminated from the unknown consists of restrictions of that general 



Maps of Meaning 209 


significance (often, of restrictions to zero—to irrelevance). Such restriction is, however, 
purely conditional, and remains intact only as long as the culturally determined model of 
meaning itself maintains its functional utility (including credibility). “Maintains its 
functional utility” means insofar as the culture posits a reasonable current description, a 
believable end goal, and a workable mode of transforming the former into the latter 
(workable for the individual, and for the maintenance and expansion of the culture itself). 

Figure 41: Order, the Great Father, as Son of the Uroboros 5 " schematically 
portrays the Great Father as masculine offspring of precosmogonic chaos; as embodiment 
of the known, the predictable, the familiar; as security and tyranny simultaneously. The 
Great Father is

patriarchal society, tradition, pomp and circumstance, military-industrial complex, and 
superego: demanding, rigid, unjust, dangerous and necessary. Fie is ambivalent in 
precisely the same manner as the Great Mother, his “wife.” In the guise of literal father, 
he is protection for children, who are too immature and vulnerable to deal with the 
unknown. More abstractly, he is the pattern of behavior the father represents, that 
becomes “internalized” during maturation. The Great Father takes the infinite possibility

of spirit that the infant represents and forges it into something limited but actual. He is 
manner incarnate, ruling all social interactions. 

Figure 42: Explored Territory as Orderly, Protective Father 353 presents the Great 
Father as wise king, security. The wise king maintains stability, not because he is afraid 
of the unknown, but because nothing new can be built without a strong foundation. He is 
the adaptive routine, developed by the heroes of the past, whose adoption by those in the 
present allows for control and safety. He is a house with doors; a structure that shelters, 
but does not stifle; a master who teaches and disciplines but does not indoctrinate or 
crush. He represents the tradition fostering cooperation among people whose shared 
culture makes trust possible.

even easy. The Great Father as Wise King keeps one foot on the Terrible Mother; the 
monsters of chaos are locked up in his dungeon or banished to the nether regions of the 




Maps of Meaning 211 


kingdom. He is the personality of dead heroes (that is, the action patterns and hierarchies 
of value established through exploration in the past) organized according to the principle 
of “respect for the intrinsic value of the living.” This makes him the king who takes 
advice from his subjects—who is willing to enter into creative interchange with those he 
“dominates” legally—and to benefit from this advice from the “unworthy.” 

Knowledge of the necessity for such interplay between strong and weak emerged into 
explicit Western consciousness not least through the actions of the ancient Hebrew 
prophets. The philosopher of religion Huston Smith draws two examples from the Bible 
to illustrate this point: 

One is the story of Naboth who, because he refused to turn over his family 
vineyard to King Ahab, was framed on false charges of blasphemy and 
subversion and then stoned; as blasphemy was a capital crime, his 
property then reverted to the throne. When news of this travesty reached 
Elijah, the word of the Lord came to him, saying, 

[“Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Sama’ria; 
behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take 
possession. 

And you shall say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Have you killed, and 
also taken possession?”’ and you shall say to him. Thus says the LORD: 

“In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick 
your own blood.”’” (1 Kings 21:18, 19 RSV)] 

The story carries revolutionary significance for human history, for it is 
the story of how someone without official position took the side of a 
wronged man and denounced a king to his face on grounds of injustice. 

One will search the annals of history in vain for its parallel. Elijah was not 
a priest. He had no formal authority for the terrible judgment he delivered. 

The normal pattern of the day would have called for him to be struck 
down by bodyguards on the spot. But the fact that he was “speaking for” 
an authority not his own was so transparent that the king accepted Elijah’s 
pronouncement as just. 

The same striking sequence recurred in the incident of David and 
Bathsheba. From the top of his roof David glimpsed Bathsheba bathing 
and wanted her. There was an obstacle, however: she was married. To the 
royalty of those days this was a small matter; David simply moved to get 
rid of her husband. Uriah was ordered to the front lines, carrying 
instructions that he be placed in the thick of the lighting and support 
withdrawn so he would be killed. Everything went as planned; indeed, the 
procedure seemed routine until Nathan the prophet got wind of it. Sensing 
immediately that “the thing that David had done displeased the Lord,” he 
went straight to the king, who had absolute power over his life, and said to 
him: 

[Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, “I anointed you king over 
Israel, and I delivered you out of the hand of Saul; 



Maps of meaning 212 


and I gave you your master’s house, and your master’s wives into your 
bosom, and gave you the house of Israel and of Judah; and if this were too 
little, I would add to you as much more. 

Why have you despised the word of the LORD, to do what is evil in his 
sight? You have smitten Uri’ah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken 
his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the 
Ammonites. 

Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house, because 
you have despised me, and have taken the wife of Uri’ah the Hittite to be 
your wife.” 

Thus says the LORD, “Behold, I will raise up evil against you out of 
your own house; and I will take your wives before your eyes, and give 
them to your neighbor, and he shall lie with your wives in the sight of this 
sun. 

For you did it secretly; but I will do this thing before all Israel, and 
before the sun.” 

David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan 
said to David, “The LORD also has put away your sin; you shall not die. 

Nevertheless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the 
LORD, the child that is born to you shall die.” (2 Samuel 12:7-14)] 

The surprising point in each of these accounts is not what the kings do, 
for they were merely exer-cising the universally accepted prerogatives of 
royalty in their day. The revolutionary and unprecedented fact is the way 
the prophets challenged their actions. 354 

Smith concludes: 

Stated abstractly, the Prophetic Principle can be put as follows: The 
prerequisite of political stability is social justice, for it is in the nature of 
things that injustice will not endure. Stated theologically, this point reads: 

God has high standards. Divinity will not put up forever with exploitation, 
corruption and mediocrity. 355 

The initially “undeclarable” constraint of “respect for the weaker” provides the 
precondition for the emergence of abstract and statable principles of social justice. 
Societies that lack such constraint or that come, over time, to forget the necessity of such 
constraint risk the “vengeance of God”: 

Thus says the LORD: “For three transgressions of Moab, and for four, I 
will not revoke the punishment; because he burned to lime the bones of 
the king of Edom. 

So I will send a fire upon Moab, and it shall devour the strongholds of 
Ker’ioth, and Moab shall die amid uproar, amid shouting and the sound of 
the trumpet; 

I will cut off the ruler from its midst, and will slay all its princes with 
him,” says the LORD.

Thus says the LORD: “For three transgressions of Judah, and for four, 
I will not revoke the punishment; because they have rejected the law of 
the LORD, and have not kept his statutes, but their lies have led them 
astray, after which their fathers walked. 

So I will send a tire upon Judah, and it shall devour the strongholds of 
Jerusalem.” 

Thus says the LORD: “For three transgressions of Israel, and for four, I 
will not revoke the punishment; because they sell the righteous for silver, 
and the needy for a pair of shoes— 

they that trample the head of the poor into the dust of the earth, and 
turn aside the way of the afflicted; a man and his father go in to the same 
maiden, so that my holy name is profaned; 

they lay themselves down beside every altar upon garments taken in 
pledge; and in the house of their God they drink the wine of those who 
have been fined. 

“Yet I destroyed the Amorite before them, whose height was like the 
height of the cedars, and who was as strong as the oaks; I destroyed his 
fruit above, and his roots beneath. 

Also I brought you up out of the land of Egypt, and led you forty years 
in the wilderness, to possess the land of the Amorite. 

And I raised up some of your sons for prophets, and some of your 
young men for Nazirites. Is it not indeed so, O people of Israel?” says the 
LORD. 

“But you made the Nazirites drink wine, and commanded the prophets, 
saying, ‘You shall not prophesy.’ 

“Behold, I will press you down in your place, as a cart full of sheaves 
presses down. 

Flight shall perish from the swift, and the strong shall not retain his 
strength, nor shall the mighty save his life; 




Figure 43: Explored Territory as Tyrannical Father 


he who handles the bow shall not stand, and he who is swift of foot shall 
not save himself, nor shall he who rides the horse save his life; and he 
who is stout of heart among the mighty shall flee away naked in that day,” 
says the LORD. (Amos 2:1-16 RSV) 

Such societies are tyrannical. Tyrannical societies violate the implicit principles upon 
which society itself is founded. This renders them inevitably self-defeating. 356

Figure 44: The “Heavenly Genealogy” of the 
Tyrannical and Protective Fathers 

Figure 43: Explored Territory as Tyrannical Father 357 presents the forces of tradition as 
“son-devouring king.” The conservative tendency of any culture, striving to maintain 
itself, can easily transform into the deadening weight of absolute authority. The Great 
Father as tyrant destroys what he once was and undermines what he still depends upon. 
The tyrant is the force of everything that has been, including everything that once was 
good, against everything that could be. This is the aspect of the Great Father that 
motivates adolescent rebellion and gives rise to ideological narratives attributing to 
society everything that produces the negative in man. It is the Tyrannical Father who 
consumes his own children, and who walls up the virgin princess in an inaccessible place. 
The Tyrannical Father rules absolutely, while the kingdom withers or becomes paralyzed; 
his decrepitude and age are matched only by his arrogance, inflexibility and blindness to 
evil. He is the personification of the authoritarian or totalitarian state, whose “goal” is 
reduction of all who are currently living to manifestation of a single dead “past” 
personality. When everyone is the same, everything is predictable; all things are of 
strictly determinable value, and everything unknown (and fear-provoking) is hidden

Father 

from view. Unfortunately, of course, every unpredictable and fear-provoking thing is also 
informative, and new information is vital to continued successful adjustment. 

The Great Father in his dual guise is the taboo, the barrier set up against the intrusion 
of the dangerously unpredictable, the floodgate that controls the ocean behind. He is 
protection for fools, and impediment to genius, and precondition for genius, and 
punishment for fools. His ambivalence is unavoidable, and should be recognized, for 
such recognition serves as effective antidote to naive ideologically-motivated utopian 
thought. Anything that protects and fosters (and that is therefore predictable and 
powerful) necessarily has the capacity to smother and oppress (and may manifest those 
capacities, unpredictably, in any given situation). No static political utopia is therefore 
possible—and the kingdom of God remains spiritual, not worldly. Recognition of the 
essentially ambivalent nature of the predictable—stultifying but secure—means 
discarding simplistic theories which attribute the existence of human suffering and evil 
purely to the state, or which presume that the state is all that is good, and that the 
individual should exist merely as subordinate or slave. The king is a wall. Walls provide 
a barrier to the sudden influx of the unknown, and block progress forward. One function

presupposes the other (although either may certainly come to dominate). Figure 44: The 
“Heavenly Genealogy” of the Tyrannical and Protective Fathers portrays the 
relationship between the two discriminable aspects of the known, their derivation from 
the unified but ambivalent known, and their original “descent” from the “dragon of 
chaos.” 

The Great Father is order, vs. chaos; the past, vs. the present; the old, vs. the young. 
Fie is the ancestral spirit whose force extends beyond the grave, who must be kept at bay 
with potent and humble ritual. Fie is the single personality composed of the consequences 
of the eternal war between all the great heroes of the past, and he stands over the 
developing individual, in the guise of the actual father, like a god. The Great Father is the 
old emperor, dangerously out of date—a powerful warrior in his youth, now under the 
spell of a hostile force. Fie is the eternal impediment to the virgin bride, the tyrannical 
father who wishes to keep his fruitful daughter firmly under his control. Fie is the 
authoritarian who rules the land ravaged by drought; keeper of the castle in which 
everything has been brought to a standstill. 

The Great Father is protection and necessary aid to growth, but absolute identification 
with his personality and force ultimately destroys the spirit. Culture, career and role do 
not sufficiently exhaust the possibilities of the individual. Figure 45 therefore portrays 
The Exploratory Hero —scion of chaos and order— as Son of the Great Father.

APPRENTICESHIP AND 
ENCULTURATION 

Adoption of a Shared Map 

Ideologies may be regarded as incomplete myths—as partial stories, 
whose compelling nature is a consequence of the appropriation of 
mythological ideas. The philosophy attributing individual evil to the 
pathology of social force constitutes one such partial story. Although 
society, the Great Father, has a tyrannical aspect, he also shelters, protects, 
trains and disciplines the developing individual—and places necessary 
constraints on his thought, emotion and behavior. 

Subjugation to lawful authority might more reasonably be 
considered in light of the metaphor of the apprenticeship. 
Childhood dependency must be replaced by group membership, 
prior to the development of full maturity. Such membership 
provides society with another individual to utilize as a “tool,” and 
provides the maturing but still vulnerable individual with necessary 
protection (with a group-fostered “identity”). The capacity to abide 
by social rules, regardless of the specifics of the discipline, can 
therefore be regarded as a necessary transitional stage in the 
movement from childhood to adulthood. 

Discipline should therefore be regarded as a skill that may be 
developed through adherence to strict ritual, or by immersion within 
a strict belief system or hierarchy of values. Once such discipline 
has been attained, it may escape the bounds of its developmental 
precursor. It is in this manner that true freedom is attained. It is at 
this level of analysis that all genuine religious and cultural traditions 
and dogmas are equivalent, regardless of content: they are all 
masters whose service may culminate in the development of self- 
mastery, and consequent transcendence of tradition and dogma. 

Apprenticeship is necessary, but should not on that account be 
glamorized. Dogmatic systems make harsh and unreasonable 
masters. Systems of belief and moral action—and those people 
who are identified with them—are concerned above all with self¬ 
maintenance and preservation of predictability and order. The 
(necessarily) conservative tendencies of great systems makes 
them tyrannical, and more than willing to crush the spirit of those 
they “serve.” Apprenticeship is a precursor to freedom, however, 
and nothing necessary and worthwhile is without danger. 



Apprenticeship and Enculturation 219 


Adoption of this analytic standpoint allows for a certain moral 
relativism, conjoined with an absolutist higher-order morality. The 
particulars of a disciplinary system may be somewhat unimportant. 

The fact that adherence to such a system is necessary, however, 
cannot be disregarded. 

We are all familiar with the story of benevolent nature, threatened by the rapacious forces 
of the corrupt individual and the society of the machine. The plot is solid, the characters 
believable, but Mother Nature is also malarial mosquitoes, parasitical worms, cancer and 
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. The story of peaceful and orderly tradition, undermined 
by the incautious and decadent (with the ever-present threat of chaos lurking in the 
background) is also familiar, and compelling, and true—except that the forces of 
tradition, however protective, tend to be blind, and to concern themselves more with their 
own stability than with the well-being of those subject to them. We have all heard and 
identified with the story of the brave pioneer, additionally—plough in hand, determined 
to wrest the good life and the stable state from the intransigent forces of nature—although 
we may be sporadically aware that the “intransigent forces” shaped so heroically included 
the decimated original inhabitants of our once-foreign landscape. We all know, finally, 
the story of the benevolent individual, genuine and innocent, denied access to the 
nourishing forces of the true and natural world, corrupted by the unreasonable strictures 
of society. This tale has its adherents, as well—not least because it is reassuring to 
believe that everything “bad” stems from without, rather than within. 

These stories are all ideologies (and there are many more of them). Ideologies are 
attractive, not least to the educated modern mind—credulous, despite its skepticism— 
particularly if those who embody or otherwise promote them allow the listener every 
opportunity to identify with the creative and positive characters of the story, and to deny 
their association with the negative. Ideologies are powerful and dangerous. Their power 
stems from their incomplete but effective appropriation of mythological ideas. Their 
danger stems from their attractiveness, in combination with their incompleteness. 
Ideologies tell only part of the story, but tell that part as if it were complete. This means 
that they do not take into account vast domains of the world. It is incautious to act in the 
world as if only a set of its constituent elements exist. The ignored elements conspire, so 
to speak, as a consequence of their repression, and make their existence known, 
inevitably, in some undesirable manner. 

Knowledge of the grammar of mythology might well constitute an antidote to 
ideological gullibility. Genuine myths are capable of representing the totality of 
conflicting forces, operating in any given situation. Every positive force has its 
omnipresent and eternal “enemy.” The beneficial aspect of the “natural environment” is 
therefore properly viewed in light of its capacity to arbitrarily inflict suffering and death. 
The protective and sheltering capacity of society is therefore understood in light of its 
potent tendency to tyranny and the elimination of necessary diversity. The heroic aspect 
of the individual is regarded in light of the ever-lurking figure of the adversary: arrogant, 
cowardly and cruel. A story accounting for all of these “constituent elements of reality” is 
balanced and stable, in contrast to an ideology—and far less likely to produce an outburst 
of social psychopathology. But the forces that make up the world as a forum for action 
constantly war in opposition. How is it possible to lay a path between them, so to speak— 



Maps of meaning 220 


to configure a mode of being that takes “all things” into account, without being destroyed 
in the process? A developmental account of the relationship between “the forces of the 
individual, society and chaos” might aid in the comprehension of their proper interplay 

I counseled an immature thirty-something-year-old man at one point during my 
service as a psychological intern. He was always working at cross-purposes to himself, 
placing obstacles in his path and then tripping over them. (This was the literal truth, upon 
occasion. He was living with his mother, after the failure of his marriage. I suggested that 
he start cleaning up his life by cleaning up his room—which is a more difficult step than 
might be casually presupposed for someone habitually and philosophically undisciplined. 
He placed a vacuum cleaner in the doorway of his bedroom, after getting about half-way 
through the task. For a week he had to step over it, but he didn’t move it, and he didn’t 
finish the job. That situation could reasonably be regarded as a polysemic sample of his 
life.) This person had sought help because his disintegrated marriage had produced a son, 
whom he loved (or at least wanted to love). He came to therapy because he didn’t want 
his child to grow up badly, as he had. I tried to scare him into behaving properly, because 
I believed (and believe) that terror is a great and underutilized motivator. (Anxiety— 
which is ineradicable—can work against you, or for you). We spent a long time outlining, 
in great detail, the consequences of his undisciplined behavior, to that point in his life (no 
successful career, no intimate relationship, an infant son thrust into a broken family) and 
the likely long-term future results (increasing self-disgust, cynicism about life, increased 
cruelty and revenge-seeking, hopelessness and despair). We also discussed the necessity 
for discipline—that is, for adherence to a coherent and difficult moral code—for himself 
and for his son. 

Of course, he worried that any attempt on his part to shape the behavior of his son 
would interfere with the natural development and flowering of the child’s innate 
potential. So it might be said, using Jung’s terminology, that he was an “unconscious 
exponent” 359 of the philosophy of Rousseau: 

With what simplicity I should have demonstrated that man is by nature 
good, and that only our institutions have made him bad! 360 

That is—the Rousseau who repeatedly placed his own children in foundling asylums 
because their existence was inconvenient to him (and, we must presuppose, detrimental to 
the flowering of his intrinsic goodness). Anyway, the fervent hope of every undisciplined 
person (even an undisciplined genius) is that his current worthlessness and stupidity is 
someone else’s fault. If—in the best of cases—it is society’s fault, then society can be 
made to pay. This sleight-of-hand maneuver transforms the undisciplined into the 
admirable rebel, at least in his own eyes, and allows him to seek unjustified revenge in 
the disguise of the revolutionary hero. A more absurd parody of heroic behavior can 
hardly be imagined. 

One time my client came to me with a dream: 

My son was asleep in his crib inside a small house. Lightning came in 
through his window, and bounced around inside the house. The lightning 
was powerful, and beautiful, but I was afraid it would burn the house 
down. 



Apprenticeship and Enculturation 221 


Dream interpretation is a difficult and uncertain business, but I believed that this image 
was interpretable within the context of our ongoing discussions. The lightning 
represented the potential implicit in the infant. This potential was an exceedingly strong 
and useful force—like electricity. But electricity is only useful when harnessed. 
Otherwise it burns down houses. 

I can’t say much about the outcome of this particular case, as internship contact with 
those seeking psychological help tends to be restricted in time. My client seemed, at least, 
more negatively affected by his immature behavior, which struck me as a reasonable 
start; furthermore, he understood (at least explicitly, although not yet procedurally) that 
discipline could be the father of the hero, and not just his enemy. The dawning of such 
understanding meant the beginnings of a mature and healthy philosophy of life, on his 
part. Such a philosophy was outlined in explicit detail by Friedrich Nietzsche, despite his 
theoretically “antidogmatic” stance. 

Nietzsche has been casually regarded as a great enemy of Christianity. I believe, 
however, that he was consciously salutary in that role. When the structure of an 
institution has become corrupt—particularly according to its own principles—it is the act 
of a friend to criticize it. Nietzsche is also viewed as fervid individualist and social 
revolutionary—as the prophet of the superman, and the ultimate destroyer of tradition. Fie 
was, however, much more sophisticated and complex than that. Fie viewed the 
“intolerable discipline” of the Christian church, which he “despised,” as a necessary and 
admirable precondition to the freedom of the European spirit, which he regarded as not 
yet hilly realized: 

Every morality is, as opposed to laisser ciller, a bit of tyranny against 
“nature”; also against “reason”; but this in itself is no objection, as long as 
we do not have some other morality which permits us to decree that every 
kind of tyranny and unreason is impermissible. What is essential and 
inestimable in every morality is that it constitutes a long compulsion: to 
understand Stoicism or Port-Royal or Puritanism, one should recall the 
compulsion under which every language so far has achieved strength and 
freedom—the metrical compulsion of rhyme and rhythm. 

Flow much trouble the poets and orators of all peoples have taken—not 
excepting a few prose writers today in whose ear there dwells an 
inexorable conscience—“for the sake of some foolishness,” as utilitarian 
dolts say, feeling smart—“submitting abjectly to capricious laws,” as 
anarchists say, feeling “free,” even “free-spirited.” But the curious fact is 
that all there is or has been on earth of freedom, subtlety, boldness, dance, 
and masterly sureness, whether in thought itself or in government, or in 
rhetoric and persuasion, in the arts just as in ethics, has developed only 
owing to the “tyranny of such capricious laws”; and in all seriousness, the 
probability is by no means small that precisely this is “nature” and 
“natural”—and not that laisser alter. 

Every artist knows how far from any feeling of letting himself go his 
“most natural” state is—the free ordering, placing, disposing, giving form 
in the moment of “inspiration”—and how strictly and subtly he obeys 
thousandfold laws precisely then, laws that precisely on account of their 



Maps of meaning 222 


hardness and determination defy all formulation through concepts (even 
the firmest concept is, compared with them, not free of fluctuation, 
multiplicity and ambiguity). 

What is essential “in heaven and on earth” seems to be, to say it once 
more, that there should be obedience over a long period of time and in a 
single direction: given that, something always develops, and has 
developed, for whose sake it is worthwhile to live on earth; for example, 
virtue, art, music, dance, reason, spirituality—something transfiguring, 
subtle, mad, and divine. The long unfreedom of the spirit, the mistrustful 
constraint in the communicability of thoughts, the discipline thinkers 
imposed on themselves to think within the directions laid down by a 
church or court, or under Aristotelian presuppositions, the long spiritual 
will to interpret all events under a Christian schema and to rediscover and 
justify the Christian god in every accident—all this, however forced, 
capricious, hard, gruesome, and antirational, has shown itself to be the 
means through which the European spirit has been trained to strength, 
ruthless curiosity, and subtle mobility, though admittedly in the process an 
irreplaceable amount of strength and spirit had to be crushed, stifled, and 
ruined (for here, as everywhere, “nature” manifests herself as she is, in all 
her prodigal and indifferent magnificence, which is outrageous but noble). 

That for thousands of years European thinkers thought merely in order 
to prove something—today, conversely, we suspect every thinker who 
“wants to prove something”—that the conclusions that ought to be the 
result of their most rigorous reflection were always settled from the start, 
just as it used to be with Asiatic astrology, and still is today with the 
innocuous Christian-moral interpretation of our most intimate personal 
experiences “for the glory of God” and “for the salvation of the soul”— 
this tyranny, this caprice, this rigorous and grandiose stupidity has 
educated the spirit. Slavery is, as it seems, both in the cruder and in the 
more subtle sense, the indispensable means of spiritual discipline and 
cultivation, too. Consider any morality with this in mind: what there is in 
it of “nature” teaches hatred of the laisser aller, of any all-too-great 
freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons and the nearest 
tasks—teaching the narrowing of our perspective, and thus in a certain 
sense stupidity, as a condition of life and growth. 

“You shall obey—someone and for a long time: else you will perish 
and lose the last respect for yourself’—this appears to me to be the 
categorical imperative of nature which, to be sure, is neither “categorical” 
as the old Kant would have it (hence the “else”) nor addressed to the 
individual (what do individuals matter to her?), but to peoples, races, ages, 
classes—but above all to the whole human animal, to man. 361 


This is the philosophy of apprenticeship —useful for conceptualizing the necessary 
relationship between subordination to a potent historically constructed social institution 
and the eventual development of true freedom. 



Apprenticeship and Enculturation 223 


A child cannot live on its own. Alone, it drowns in possibility. The unknown 
supersedes individual adaptive capacity, in the beginning. It is only the transmission of 
historically determined behavioral patterns—and, secondarily, their concomitant 
descriptions—that enables survival in youth. These patterns of behavior and hierarchies 
of value—which children mimic and then learn expressly—give secure structure to 
uncertain being. It is the group, initially in parental guise, that stands between the child 
and certain psychological catastrophe. The depression, anxiety and physical breakdown 
that is characteristic of too early childhood separation from parents is the result of 
exposure to “too much unknown” and incorporation of “too little cultural structure.” The 
long period of human dependency must be met with the provision of a stable social 
environment—with predictable social interactions, which meet individual motivational 
demands; with the provision of behavioral patterns and schemas of value capable of 
transforming the unpredictable and frightening unknown into its beneficial equivalent. 
This means that transformation of childhood dependency entails adoption of ritual 
behavior (even regular meal-and-bed-times are rituals) and incorporation of a morality (a 
framework of reference) with an inevitably metaphysical foundation. 

Successful transition from childhood to adolescence means identification with the 
group, rather than continued dependency upon the parents. Identification with the group 
provides the individual with an alternative, generalized, nonparental source of protection 
from the unknown, and provides the group with the resources of another soul. The group 
constitutes a historically validated pattern of adaptation (specific behaviors, descriptions 
of behavior and general descriptions). The individual’s identification with this pattern 
strengthens him when he needs to separate from his parents and take a step toward 
adulthood, and it strengthens the group, insofar as it now has access to his individual 
abilities. The individual’s identification with this pattern bolsters his still-maturing ability 
to stand on his own two feet—supports his determination to move away from the all- 
encompassing and too secure maternal-dependent world. Identity with the group 
therefore comes to replace recourse to parental authority as “way of being in the face of 
the unknown.” It provides structure for social relationships (with self and others), 
determines the meaning of objects, provides desirable end as ideal, and establishes 
acceptable procedure (acceptable mode for the “attainment of earthly paradise”). 

Personal identification with the group means socialization, individual embodiment of 
the valuations of the group—primarily, as expressed in behavior. Group values constitute 
cumulative historical judgment rendered on the relative importance of particular states of 
motivation, with due regard for intensity, as expressed in individual action, in the social 
context. All societies are composed of individuals whose actions constitute embodiment 
of the creative past. That creative past can be conceptualized as the synthesis of all 
culture-creating exploratory communicative activity, including the act of synthesis itself. 

Myth comprises description of procedural knowledge; constitutes episodic/semantic 
representation of cumulative behavioral wisdom, in increasingly abstracted form. 
Introduction of the previously dependent individual at adolescence to the world of 
ancestral behavior and myth constitutes transmission of culture—inculcation of the Great 
Father, historically determined personality and representation of such—as adaptation to, 
explanation of and protection against the unknown, the Great and Terrible Mother. This 
introduction reaches its culmination with initiation, the primary ritual signifying cultural 



Maps of meaning 224 


transmission—the event which destroys the “unconscious” union between child and 
biological mother. 

The child is born in a state of abject dependence. The caring mother is simultaneously 
individual force and embodiment of impersonal biological beneficience—the eternal 
mythic virgin mother, material consort of God. The infant comes equipped with the 
ability to respond to this innately nurturing presence, to develop a symbiotic relationship 
with his or her caregiver, and to grow increasingly strong. The maturation of creative 
exploratory capacity, which constitutes the basis for mature self-reliance, appears 
dependent for its proper genesis upon the manifestation of maternal solicitude: upon love, 
balanced promotion of individual ability and protection from harm. Tender touch and 
care seduce the infant to life, to expansion of independence, to potential for individual 
strength and ability. 362 The absence of such regard means failure to thrive, depression and 
intrapsychic damage, even death. 363 

The maturing individual necessarily (tragically, heroically) expands past the domain of 
paradisal maternal protection, in the course of development; necessarily attains an 
apprehension whose desire for danger and need for life exceeds the capability of maternal 
shelter. This means that the growing child eventually comes to face problems—how to 
get along with peers in peer-only play groups; how to select a mate from among a myriad 
of potential mates—that cannot be solved (indeed, may be made more difficult) by 
involvement of the beneficial maternal. Such problems might be regarded as emergent 
consequences of the process of maturation itself; of the increased possibility for action 
and comprehension necessarily attendant upon maturation. A four-year-old, making the 
transition to kindergarten, cannot use a three-year-old’s habits and schemas of 
representation to make his way in the novel social world. A thirteen-year-old cannot use a 
seven-year-old’s personality—no matter how healthy—to solve the problems endemic to 
adolescence. The group steps in—most evidently, at the point of adolescence—and 
provides “permeable” protective shelter to the child too old for the mother but not old 
enough to stand alone. The universally disseminated rituals of initiation—induced 
“spiritual” death and subsequent rebirth—catalyzes the development of adult personality; 
follows the fundamental pattern of the cyclic, circular cosmogonic myth of the way. The 
culturally determined rites and biological processes associated with initiation constitute 
absolute destruction of childhood personality, of childhood dependence—initial 
unselfconscious “paradisal” stability—for necessary catalysis of group identification. 
Such rituals tend to be more complex and far-reaching for males than for females. This is 
perhaps in part because male development seems more easily led astray, in a socially 
harmful manner, than female (adolescent males are more delinquent and aggressive 364 ) 
and in part because female transition to adulthood is catalyzed “by nature” in the form of 
comparatively rapid maturation and the naturally dramatic onset of menstruation. 

The group to which the initiate is introduced consists of a complex interweaving of 
behavioral patterns established and subsequently organized in the past, as a consequence 
of voluntary creative communicative exploration. The group is the current expression of a 
pattern of behavior developed over the course of hundreds of thousands of years. This 
pattern is constructed of behaviors established initially by creative heroes—by 
individuals who were able and willing to do and to think something that no one had been 
able to do or to think before. Integration of these behaviors into a stable hierarchy, and 
abstract representation of them, in the course of a process beginning with imitation and 



Apprenticeship and Enculturation 225 


ending in semantic description, produces a procedural and declarable structure whose 
incorporation dramatically increases the individual’s behavioral repertoire and his or her 
descriptive, predictive and representational ability. This incorporation—which is 
primarily implicit, and therefore invis-ible—is identification with the group. 
Identification with the group means the provision of determinate meaning, as the antidote 
to excruciating ignorance and exposure to chaos. 

A multitude of (specific) rituals have evolved to catalyze such identification. Catalysis 
often appears necessary, as the movement to adolescence is vitally important but 
psychologically challenging, involving as it does “voluntary” sacrifice of childhood 
dependency (which is a valid form of adaptation, but predicated upon [nondeclarative] 
assumptions suitable only to the childhood state). Such transitional rituals are generally 
predicated upon enaction of the fundamental narrative structure—the Way—previously 
presented. Ritual initiation, for example—a ubiquitous formal feature of pre-experimental 
culture 365 —takes place at or about the onset of puberty, when it is critical for further 
psychological development and continued tribal security that boys transcend their 
dependency upon their mothers. This separation often takes place under purposefully 
frightening and violent conditions. In the general initation pattern, the men, acting as a 
unit (as the embodiment of social history 366 ), separate the initiates from their mothers, 
who offer a certain amount of more or less dramatized resistance and some genuine 
sorrow (at the “death” of their children). 

The boys know that they are to be introduced to some monstrous power who exists in 
the night, in the forest or cave, in the depths of the unknown. This power, capable of 
devouring them, serves as the mysterious deity of the initiation. Once removed from their 
mothers, the boys begin their ritual. This generally involves some mixture of induced 
regression of personality—reduction to the state of “precosmogonic chaos,” extant prior 
even to earliest childhood—and induction of overwhelming fear, accompanied by severe 
physical or spiritual hardship or torture. The initiates are often forbidden to talk, and may 
be fed by the men. They may be circumcised, mutilated or interred alive—required to 
undergo intense punishment, subjected to intense dread. They symbolically pass into the 
maw of the Terrible Mother and are reborn as men, as adult members of the “tribe,” 
which is the historical cumulation of the consequences of adaptive behavior. (Initiates 
often actually pass, literally, through the body of some constructed beast, aided by the 
elders of the tribe, who serve as the agents of this deity. 367 ) When the rite is successfully 
completed, the initiated are no longer children, dependent upon the arbitrary beneficience 
of nature—in the guise of their mothers—but are members of the tribe of men, active 
standard-bearers of their particular culture, who have had their previously personality 
destroyed, so to speak, by fire. They have successfully faced the worst trial they are likely 
ever to encounter in their lives. 

The terror induced by ritual exposure to the forces of the unknown appears to put the 
brain into a state characterized by enhanced suggestibility—or, at least, by dramatically 
heightened need for order, by need for coherent and meaningful narrative. The person 
who is in a “state” where he no longer knows what to do or what to expect is highly 
motivated to escape that state, by whatever means necessary. The stripping away of a 
former mode of adaptation, engendered by dramatic shift of social locale (of “context”), 
produces within the psyche of those so treated a state of acute apprehension, and intense 
desire for the re-establishment of predictability and sense. This acute apprehension is, as 



Maps of meaning 226 


we have seen, the consequence of the “renovelization” of the environment: sufficient 
challenge posed to the integrity 



Figure 46: The “Death” and “Rebirth” of the 
Adolescent Initiate 

of a previous personality disrupts its structure, “freeing” phenomena previously adapted 
to from the grasp of familiar action and valuation. The phenomena, thus “free,” then once 
again “possess” sufficient “energy” to motivate their reconceptualization (that is, to make 
of that process of reconceptualization something sufficiently vital and important to stamp 
itself into memory—into permanent incarnation as “personality”). 

The ritually “reduced” and terrified initiates, unable to rely on the adaptive strategies 
utilized during their childhoods, desperately need new explanations and new patterns of 
behavior to survive in what is, after all, a new environment. That new environment is the 
society of men, where women are sexual partners and equals instead of sources of 
dependent comfort; where the provision of food and shelter is a responsibility, and not a 
given; where security—final authority, in the form of parent—no longer exists. As the 
childhood “personality” is destroyed, the adult personality—a manifestation of 




Apprenticeship and Enculturation 227 


transmitted culture—is inculcated. The general initiatory “narrative” or ritual is presented 
schematically in Figure 46: The “Death” and “Rebirth” of the Adolescent Initiate. 

The comparatively more abstracted rite of baptism is predicated upon similar 
principles. Baptism is the dramatic or episodic representation of the act or ritual of 
initiation—or, at least, stands midway between the entirely “unconscious” or procedural 
forms of initiation and their semantically abstracted symbolic equivalents. Baptism is 
spiritual birth (rebirth), as opposed to birth of the flesh. The font of the church, which 
contains the baptismal water, is a symbolic analog of the uterus 368 (the uterus 
ecclesiastiae), which is the “original” place that transforms precosmogonic chaos into 
spirit-embodied matter (into “personality”). When the initiate is plunged into (now 
sprinkled with) baptismal water, he or she is symbolically reduced, from insufficient 
stability to chaos; is drowned as a profane being, and then resurrected; is reunited 
(incestuously, mythically speaking) with the Great Mother, then reborn formally into the 
community of the spirit. 369 Such abstracted reductions to “death” and symbolic 
reconstructions constitute ritualization and representation of the processes endlessly 
necessary to revitalization of the individual personality and the social group. Eliade 
states: 


The majority of initiatory ordeals more or less clearly imply a ritual death 
followed by resurrection or a new birth. The central moment of every 
initiation is represented by the ceremony symbolizing the death of the 
novice and his return to the fellowship of the living. But he returns to life 
a new man, assuming another mode of being. Initiatory death signifies the 
end at once of childhood, of ignorance, and of the profane condition.... 

All the rites of rebirth or resurrection, and the symbols that they imply, 
indicate that the novice has attained to another mode of existence, 
inaccessible to those who have not undergone the initiatory ordeals, who 
have not tasted death. We must note this characteristic of the archaic 
mentality: the belief that a state cannot be changed without first being 
annihilated—in the present instance, without the child’s dying to 
childhood. It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of this obsession 
with beginnings, which, in sum, is the obsession with the absolute 
beginning, the cosmogony. For a thing to be well done, it must be done as 
it was the first time. But the first time, the thing—this class of objects, this 
animal, this particular behavior—did not exist: when, in the beginning, 
this object, this animal, this institution, came into existence, it was as if, 
through the power of the Gods, being arose from nonbeing. 

Initiatory death is indispensable for the beginning of spiritual life. Its 
function must be understood in relation to what it prepares: birth to a 
higher mode of being.... [Ijnitiatory death is often symbolized, for 
example, by darkness, by cosmic night, by the telluric womb, the hut, the 
belly of a monster. All these images express regression to a preformal 
state, to a latent mode of being (complementary to the precos-mogonic 
Chaos), rather than total annihilation (in the sense in which, for example, 
a member of the modern societies conceives death). These images and 



Maps of meaning 228 


symbols of ritual death are inextricably connected with germination, with 
embryology; they already indicate a new life in course of preparation.... 

For archaic thought, then, man is made—he does not make himself all 
by himself. It is the old initiates, the spiritual masters, who make him. But 
these masters apply what was revealed to them at the beginning of Time 
by Supernatural Beings. They are only the representatives of these Beings; 
indeed, in many cases, they incarnate them. This is as much as to say that 
in order to become a man, it is necessary to resemble a mythical model. 70 

Groups are individuals, uniform in their acceptance of a collective historically determined 
behavioral pattern and schema of value. Internalization of this pattern, and the description 
thereof (the myths—and philosophies, in more abstracted cultures—which accompany 
it), simultaneously produces ability to act in a given (social) environment, to predict the 
outcomes of such action, and to determine the meaning of general events (meaning 
inextricably associated with behavioral outcome). Such internalization culminates in the 
erection of implicit procedural and explicit declarable structures of “personality,” which 
are more or less isomorphic in nature, which simultaneously constitute habit and moral 
knowledge. Habit is a way of being, a general strategy for “redemption” in the “natural” 
and “cultural” spheres, shaped by the social exchange of affect-laden information, 
mastered to the point of “unconscious” automaticity. Moral knowledge is fixed 
representation of the (previously) “unknown”; is generation of capacity to predict the 
behavior of objects, other people and the self. The sum total of accurate behaviorally 
linked representation of the world as forum for action constitutes the structure which 
reduces the manifold meaning of the experiential plenum to a restricted and therefore 
manageable domain. The manifold meaning is anxiety, on first contact (or under 
uncontrolled, overwhelming or involuntary conditions of exposure)—anxiety, which 
would otherwise be generated in response to everything. Interference with adolescent 
initiation-catalyzed group incarnation is therefore disruption of or failure to (re)generate 
the structure providing for respite from unbearable existential anxiety. 

A society “works” to the degree that it provides its members with the capacity to 
predict and control the events in their experiential field—to the degree that it provides a 
barrier, protection from the unknown or unexpected. Culture provides a ritual model for 
behavioral emulation, and heuristics for desire and prediction—active procedures for 
behavior in the social and nonsocial worlds, plus description of processes in the social 
and nonsocial worlds, including behavioral processes. Incorporation of culture therefore 
means fixed adaptation to the unknown; means, simultaneously, inhibition of novelty- 
induced fear, regulation of interpersonal behavior, and provision of redemptive mode of 
being. The group is the historical structure that humanity has erected between the 
individual and the terrible unknown. Intrapsychic representation of culture— 
establishment of group identity—protects individuals from overwhelming fear of their 
own experience; from contact with the a priori meaning of things and situations. This is 
the intercession of the mythic Great Father against the terrible world of the Great Mother. 
This intercession is provision of a specific goal schema, allowing for the transformation 
of the vagaries of individual experience into positive events, within a social context, in 
the presence of protection against the unbearable unknown. 



Apprenticeship and Enculturation 229 


This historically determined cultural structure is constructed of courageously 
engineered and creatively integrated responses to situations that arise typically in the 
course of human experience, arranged in terms of their relative importance, organized 
simultaneously to minimize intrapsychic motivational and external interpersonal conflict, 
and to allow for contin-ued adaptation. This (primarily nonverbal) socially transmitted 
structure of assumption, expectation and behavior is very stable, under most 
circumstances. It has seen everything, and done everything, so to speak, and cannot be 
easily undermined. In most situations, it efficiently governs social interaction, general 
expectation, and organization of goal-directed behavior. In its implicit imitative, 
dramatic, narrative form, it is exceptionally durable, and highly resistant to naive social 
revolution.' 71 However, such stability is advantageous only in stable times. Under 
exceptional circumstances—when the environment shifts rapidly, for reasons 
independent of or dependent upon human activity—the historical “personality” must be 
altered or even qualitatively reconfigured to allow equally rapid adaptation to take place. 
This process of rearrangement is necessarily predicated upon disruption (death) of the old 
order. Dissolution of the old order means (potential) return of the determinate meaning of 
experiential objects to their preclassified state of chaos—simultaneously unbearably 
threatening and, secondarily, infinitely promising. Apprehension of the inevitability of 
such dissolution, however vague, constitutes one potent barrier to the process of creative 
readaptation. 

The historical structure “protects itself” and its structure in two related manners. First, 
it inhibits intrinsically rewarding but “antisocial” behaviors (those which might upset the 
stability of the group culture) by associating them with certain punishment (or at least 
with the threat thereof). This punishment might include actual application of undesirable 
penalties or, more “subtly”—removal of “right to serve as recognized representative of 
the social structure.” This means, in the latter case, forced individual forfeit of 
identification with (imitation of, internalization of) said social structure (at least for the 
once-socialized), and induction of overwhelming guilt or anxiety, as a consequence of 
goal loss, value dissolution, and subsequent re-exposure to the novelty of 
decontextualized experience. It is the potential for such an affectively unbearable state 
that constitutes the power of banishment—which can be used “consciously” by societies 
to punish wrongdoers—or that can be experienced as a self-induced state, by individuals 
careless, arrogant or ignorant enough to “kill” what supports them. ' 7 ’ 

The culturally-determined historical structure protects and maintains itself secondly by 
actively promoting individual participation in behavioral strategies that satisfy individual 
demand, and that simultaneously increase the stability of the group. The socially 
constructed way of a profession, for example, allows the individual who incarnates that 
profession opportunity for meaningful activity in a manner that supports or at least does 
not undermine the stability of the historically determined structure which regulates the 
function of his or her threat-response system. Adoption of a socially sanctioned 
“professional personality” therefore provides the initiated and identified individual with 
peer-approved opportunity for intrinsic goal-derived pleasure, and with relative freedom 
from punishment, shame and guilt. Potentially upsetting competition between socially 
sanctified ways of being, within a given social group, is also subject to cultural 
minimization. Each of the many professions whose union comprises a functioning 
complex society is the consequence of the heroic past activities which established the 




Maps of meaning 230 


profession, modified by the equally heroic activities that allowed for its maintenance and 
“update” (in the presence of other competing activities and ever-changing 
“environmental” demand). “Lawyer” and “physician,” for example, are two embodied 
ideologies, nested within more complex overarching narrative schemas, whose domains 
of activity, knowledge and competence have been delimited, one against the other, until 
both can occupy the same “territory” without emergence of destructive and 
counterproductive conflict. This is the “organization of dead kings,” so to speak, under 
the dominion of the “hero”: doctors and lawyers are both subject to “higher-order (legal) 
principles” which govern their behavior such that one group can tolerate—at least within 
reason—the presence of the other. 

The properly structured patriarchal system fulfills the needs of the present while 
“taking into account” those of the future; simultaneously, it balances the demands of the 
self with those of the other. The suitability of the “cultural solution” is judged by 
individual affective response. This grounding of verification in universally constant 
affect, in combination with the additional constraints of stability and adaptability, means 
inevitable construction of human groups and human moral systems with centrally 
identifiable features and processes of generation. The construction of a successful group, 
the most difficult of feats, means establishment of a society composed of individuals who 
act in their own interest (at least enough to render their life bearable) and who, in doing 
so, simultaneously maintain and advance their culture. The “demand to satisfy, protect 
and adapt, individually and socially”—and to do so over vast and variable stretches of 
time—places severe intrinsic constraints on the manner in which successful human 
societies can operate. It might be said that such constraints provide universal boundaries 
for acceptable human morality. The nature of what constitutes such acceptability fosters 
direct conflict or debate, in terms of the details, but the broad picture is necessarily clear. 
That picture is presented and represented in ritual, mythology and narrative, which 
eternally depict intrinsically meaningful themes, playing themselves out, in eternally 
fascinating fashion. Nietzsche states: 

That individual philosophical concepts are not anything capricious or 
autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with 
each other; that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear in 
the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to a system 
as all the members of the fauna of a continent—is betrayed in the end also 
by the fact that the most diverse philosophers keep filling in a definite 
fundamental scheme of possible philosophies. Under an invisible spell, 
they always revolve once more in the same orbit; however independent of 
each other they may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, 
something within them leads them, something impels them in a definite 
order, one after the other—to wit, the innate systematic structure and 
relationship of their concepts. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a 
discovery than a recognition, a remembering, a return and a homecoming 
to a remote, primordial, and inclusive household of the soul, out of which 
those concepts grew originally: philosophizing is to this extent a kind of 
atavism of the highest order. 373 



Apprenticeship and Enculturation 231 


Adoption of a particular way of being allows, concurrently, for determination of the 
meaning of objects, and the morality of behaviors. Objects attain significance according 
to their perceived utility—with regard to their capacity to further movement away from 
the unbear-able present toward the ideal future; likewise, moral behavior is seen as 
furthering and immoral behavior as impeding or undermining such movement. Of course, 
identification of what constitutes the basis for establishing the nature of morality or the 
comparative value of objects is no simple matter. In fact, such judgment comprises the 
constant central demand of adaptation. No fixed answer solution to this problem can be 
offered—this question, “the nature of the highest ideal” or “the nature of the highest 
good”—because the environment posing the query, so to speak, constantly shifts, as time 
progresses (that shift constitutes, in fact, time’s progression). The constant fact of eternal 
change does not eliminate the utility of all “moral” answers, however, as such answers 
must be formulated, before any action or interpretation can take place. Time merely 
makes eternal nonsense of the offer of fixed structure as solution—fixed structure, that is, 
as opposed to process (in this case, the patterned creative communicative process of 
generating adaptive structure). 

Conflict, on the individual and social planes, constitutes dispute about the comparative 
value of experiences, objects and behaviors. Nondeclarative presumption “a,” upon 
which behavior “a” is (hypothetically) predicated, becomes subjugated to presumption 
“b,” “b” to “c,” and so on, in accordance with some implicit scheme or notion of ultimate 
value which firsts manifests itself in behavior, and in behavioral conflict, long before it 
can be represented episodically or semantically. It might be said that the emergence of a 
scheme of ultimate value is an inevitable consequence of the social and exploratory 
evolution of man. Cultural structure, incarnated intrapsychically, originates in creative 
action, imitation of such action, integration of action and imitated action—constitutes 
adaptive action and representation of integrated pattern of action. Procedures may be 
mapped in episodic memory and abstracted in essence by the semantic system. This 
process results in construction of a story, or narrative. Any narrative contains, implicit in 
it, a set of moral assumptions. Representation of this (primarily social) moral code in 
form of episodic memory constitutes the basis for myth; provides the ground and material 
for eventual linguistically mediated development of religious dogma or codified morality. 
Advantages of such codification are the advantages granted by abstraction per se —ease 
of communication, facilitation of transformation—and formal declaration of (historically 
sanctified) principles useful in mediation of emergent value-centered dispute. 
Disadvantages—more subtle, and more easily unrecognized—include premature closure 
of creative endeavor, and dogmatic reliance on wisdom of the (dead) past. 

Human beings, as social animals, act “as if’ motivated by a (limited) system of more 
or less internally consistent and integrated set of moral virtues, even in the absence of the 
explicit (declarative) representation of this system. The nature of these virtues, embodied 
in behavior, in their origin, have become more and more conscious (more represented in 
declarative thinking and remembering) over the course of socially mediated human 
cognitive evolution. Nonetheless it is very difficult to determine and explicitly state just 
what virtuous behavior consists of; to describe, with accuracy, how it is that people 
should (and do) act—to identify those ends toward which behavior should be devoted, 
and to provide explicit and rigorous justification for such claims. A culture is, to a large 
degree, a shared moral code, and deviations from that code are generally easily identified, 



Maps of meaning 232 


at least post-hoc. It is still the case, however, that description of the domain of morality 
tends to exceed the capability of declarative thought, and that the nature of much of what 
we think of as moral behavior is still, therefore, embedded in unconscious procedure. As 
a consequence, it is easy for us to become confused about the nature of morality, and to 
draw inappropriate, untimely and dangerous “fixed” conclusions. 

The conservative worships his culture, appropriately, as the creation of that which 
deserves primary allegiance, remembrance and respect. This creation is the concrete 
solution to the problem of adaptation: “how to behave?” (and how can that be represented 
and communicated?). It is very easy, in consequence, to err in attribution of value, and to 
worship the specific solution itself, rather than the source of that solution. Hence the 
biblical injunction: 

Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of 
any thing that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is 
in the water under the earth: 

Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them, nor serve them: for I the 
Lord thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon 
the children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me. 
(Exodus 20:3-5) 

This “arbitrary” injunction exists in large part because much less explicit attention is 
generally paid ( can be paid, in the initial stages of abstract representation) to the more 
fundamental, but more abstract and difficult, meta-problem of adaptation: “how is (or 
was) how to behave determined?” or “what is the nature of the behavioral procedure that 
leads to the establishment of and rank-ordering of valid forms of how to behave? (that 
leads to successful adaptation, as such?)” and “how can that be represented and 
communicated?” The answer to the question “what constitutes the highest value?” or 
“what is the highest good?” is in fact the solution to the meta-problem, not the problem, 
although solutions to the latter have been and are at present constantly confused with 
solutions to the former—to the constant (often mortal) detriment of those attempting to 
address the former. 

The precise nature of that which constitutes morality still eludes declarative 
exposition. The moral structure, encoded in behavior, is too complex to completely 
consciously formulate. Nevertheless, that structure remains an integrated system 
(essentially, a historically determined personality, and representation thereof), a product 
of determined efforts (procedural and declarative) devoted toward integrated adaptation, 
and not a merely random or otherwise incomprehensible compilation of rituals and 
beliefs. Culture is a structure aimed toward the attainment of certain (affectively- 
grounded) ends, in the immediate present and over the longer course of time. As such, a 
given cultural structure necessarily must meet a number of stringent and severely 
constrained requirements: (1) it must be self-maintaining (in that it promotes activities 
that allow it to retain its central form); (2) it must be sufficiently flexible to allow for 
constant adaptation to constantly shifting environmental circumstances; and (3) it must 
acquire the allegiance of the individuals who compose it. 



Apprenticeship and Enculturation 233 


The first requirement is so fundamental, even in the short term, that it appears self- 
evident. A culture must promote activities that allow for its own maintenance, or it will 
devour itself. The second requirement—flexibility—is more difficult to fulfill, 
particularly in combination with the first (self-maintenance). A culture must promote 
activity that supports itself, but must simultaneously allow for enough innovation so that 
essentially unpredictable alteration in “environmental” circumstance can be met with 
appropriate change in behavioral activity. Cultures that attempt to maintain themselves 
through promotion of absolute adherence to traditional principles tend rapidly to fail the 
second requirement, and to collapse precipitously. Cultures that allow for unrestricted 
change, by contrast, tend to fail the first, and collapse equally rapidly. The third 
requirement (allegiance of the populace) might be considered a prerequisite for the first 
two. A culture that lasts must be supported (voluntarily) by those who compose it. This 
means, in the final analysis, that its mode of operation must remain verified by the sum 
total of individual affect; means that those who constitute the group must remain satisfied 
by its operation—must derive sufficient reward, protection from punishment, provision of 
hope, and alleviation of threat to render the demands of group maintenance bearable. 
Furthermore, the group solution must appear ideal—in comparison to any or all actual or 
imaginable alternatives. The compelling attractiveness of simplistic utopian ideologies, 
even in the “skeptical” twentieth century, is evidence for the stringent difficulty of this 
final requirement. 

In suboptimal circumstances, the problem of “protection for the developing 
individual” and “maintenance of the protective, uniform social structure” is solved by the 
permanent sacrifice of individual diversity to the stability and identity of the group. This 
solution banishes fear effectively, in the short term, but also eliminates necessary 
potential and the capacity for “adaptive” transformation. The suboptimal solution to the 
problem of authoritarian or totalitarian danger, in turn, is denigration of the role of 
society, attribution of evil to its effects, and degeneration of traditional skills and 
learning. This is sacrifice of the Terrible Father, without recognition of the need for his 
resuscitation—and is, therefore, an invitation to the intrusion of chaos. The solution to the 
problem of the necessity for group identification is, by contrast, to be found in the 
philosophy of the apprenticeship: each individual must voluntarily subjugate him- or 
herself to a master—a “wise king”—whose goal is not so much maintenance and 
protection of his own identity and status as it is construction of an individual (a “son”) 
capable of transcending the restrictions of the group. 

The optimal “wise king” to whom subordination might be regarded as necessary must 
therefore either be an individual whose “identity” is nested within a hierarchy whose 
outermost territory is occupied by the exploratory hero, or a group about which the same 
might be said. So the ideal “group” or master might be conceptualized, once again, as 
Osiris (the traditions of the past) nested within FIorus/Re (the process that originally 
created those traditions, and which presently updates them). This means that the “meta¬ 
problem” of adaptation— “what is the nature of the behavioral procedure that leads to 
the establishment of and rank-ordering of valid forms of how to behave? (that leads to 
successful adaptation, as such?)’’ —has been answered by groups who ensure that their 
traditions, admired and imitated, are nonetheless subordinate to the final authority of the 
creative hero. So the “highest good” becomes “imitation (worship) of the process 



Maps of meaning 234 


represented by the hero,” who, as the ancient Sumerians stated, restores all “ruined gods, 
as though they were his own creation.” 374 

Human morality is exploratory activity (and allowance for such), undertaken in a 
sufficiently stable social context, operating within stringent limitations, embodied in 
action, secondarily represented, communicated and abstractly elaborated in episodic and 
semantic memory. Such morality—act and thought—is nonarbitrary in structure and 
specifically goal-directed. It is predicated upon conceptualization of the highest good 
(which, in its highest form, is stable social organization allowing for manifestation of the 
process of creative adaptation), imagined in comparison to the represented present. Such 
conceptual activity allows for determination of acceptable behavior, and for constraint 
placed upon the meaning of objects (considered, always, in terms of their functional 
utility as tools, in a sense, for the attainment of a desired end). 

The pathological state takes imitation of the “body of the laws” to an extreme, and 
attempts to govern every detail of individual life. This “total imitation” reduces the 
behavioral flexibility of the state, and renders society increasingly vulnerable to 
devastation through environmental transformation (through the influx of “chaotic 
change”). Thus the state suffers, for lack of “the water of life,” until it is suddenly 
flooded, and swept away. The healthy state, by contrast, compels imitation more in the 
form of voluntary affiliation (until the establishment of individual competence and 
discipline). Following the successful “apprenticeship,” the individual is competent to 
serve as his own master—to serve as an autonomous incarnation of the hero. This means 
that the individual’s capacity for “cultural imitation”—that is, his capacity for 
subservience to traditional order—has been rendered subordinate to his capacity to 
function as the process that mediates between order and chaos. Each “properly 
socialized” individual therefore comes to serve as Horus (the sun king, the son of the 
Great Father), after painstakingly acquiring the wisdom of Osiris. 

The adoption of group identity—the apprenticeship of the adolescent—disciplines the 
individual, and brings necessary predictability to his or her actions within the social 
group. Group identity, however, is a construct of the past, fashioned to deal with events 
characteristic of the past. Although it is reasonable to view such identity as a necessary 
developmental stage, it is pathological to view it as the end point of human development. 
The present consists in large part of new problems, and reliance on the wisdom of the 
dead, no matter how heroic, eventually compromises the integrity of the living. The well- 
trained apprentice, however, has the skills of the dead, and the dynamic intelligence of 
the living. This means that he can benefit from—even welcome—inevitable contact with 
anomaly, in its many guises. The highest level of morality therefore governs behavior in 
those spaces where tradition does not rule. The exploratory hero is at home in unexplored 
territory—is friend of the stranger, welcoming ear for the new idea, and cautious, 
disciplined social revolutionary.

THE APPEARANCE OF ANOMALY 

Challenge to the Shared Map 

Moral theories necessarily share common features with other theories. 
One of the most fundamental shared features of theories, in general, is 
their reliance on “extra-theoretical” presuppositions. The “extra- 
theoretical” presuppositions of explicit moral theorems appear to take 
implicit form in image and, more fundamentally, in action. Moral 
behaviors and schemas of valuation arise as a consequence of behavioral 
interaction undertaken in the social world: every individual, motivated to 
regulate his emotions through action, modifies the behavior of others, 
operating in the same environment. The consequence of this mutual 
modification, operating over time, is the emergence of a stable pattern of 
behavior, “designed” to match individual and social needs, 
simultaneously. Eventually, this behavioral pattern comes to be coded in 
image, heralded in narrative, and explicitly represented in words. In the 
integrated individual—or the integrated state—action, imagination and 
explicit verbal thought are isomorphic: explicit and image-mediated 
beliefs and actual behaviors form a coherent unit. Verbal theories of 
morality (explicit rules) match traditional images of moral behavior, and 
action undertaken remains in concordance with both. This integrated 
morality lends predictability to behavior, constitutes the basis for the 
stable state, and helps ensure that emotion remains under control. 

The emergence of anomaly constitutes a threat to the integrity of 
the moral tradition governing behavior and evaluation. Strange 
things or situations can pose a challenge to the structure of a given 
system of action and related beliefs; can pose such a challenge at 
comparatively restricted (“normal”) or broader (“revolutionary”) 
levels of organization. A prolonged drought, for example, 
destructive at the social level—or the occurrence of a serious 
illness or disability, destructive at the personal—can force the 
reconstruction of behavior and the reanalysis of the beliefs that 
accompany, follow, or underlie such behavior. The appearance of a 
stranger—or, more commonly, a group of strangers—may produce 
a similar effect. The stranger acts out and holds different beliefs, 
using different implements and concepts. The mere existence of 
these anomalous beliefs, actions and tools—generally the 
consequence of prolonged, complex and powerful social¬ 
evolutionary processes—may be sufficient to totally transform or 
even destroy the culture which encounters them, unprepared. 



Maps of meaning 236 


Cultures may be upset internally, as well, as a consequence of the 
“strange idea”—or, similarly, by the actions of the revolutionary. 

The capacity to abstract, to code morality in image and word, 
has facilitated the communication, comprehension and 
development of behavior and behavioral interaction. However, the 
capacity to abstract has also undermined the stability of moral 
tradition. Once a procedure has been encapsulated in image—and, 
particularly, in word—it becomes easier to modify, “experimentally”; 
but also easier to casually criticize and discard. This capacity for 
easy modification is very dangerous, in that the explicit and 
statable moral rules that characterize a given culture tend to exist 
for reasons that are still implicit and fundamental. The capacity to 
abstract, which has facilitated the communication of very complex 
and only partially understood ideas, is therefore also the capacity to 
undermine the very structure that lends predictability to action, and 
which constrains the a priori meaning of things and situations. Our 
capacity for abstraction is capable of disrupting our 
“unconscious”—that is, imagistic and procedural—social identity, 
upsetting our emotional stability, and undermining our integrity (that 
is, the isomorphism between our actions, imaginings, and explicit 
moral theories or codes). Such disruption leaves us vulnerable to 
possession by simplistic ideologies, and susceptible to cynicism, 
existential despair, and weakness in the face of threat. 

The ever-expanding human capacity for abstraction—central to 
human “consciousness”—has enabled us to produce self-models 
sufficiently complex and extended to take into account the temporal 
boundaries of individual life. Myths of the “knowledge of good and 
evil” and the “fall from paradise” represent emergence of this 
representational capacity, in the guise of a “historical event.” The 
consequence of this “event”—that is, the development of “self- 
consciousness”—is capacity to represent death, and to understand 
that the possibility of death is “part” of the unknown. This 
“contamination of anomaly with the possibility of death” has 
dramatically heightened the emotional power and motivational 
significance of the unknown, and led to the production of complex 
systems of action and belief designed to take that terrible possibility 
into account. 

These complex systems of action and belief are religious. They 
are the traditional means of dealing with the shadow cast on life by 
knowledge of mortality. Our inability to understand our religious 
traditions—and our consequent conscious denigration of their 
perspectives—dramatically decrease the utility of what they have to 
offer. 

We are conscious enough to destabilize our beliefs and our 
traditional patterns of action, but not conscious enough to 
understand them. If the reasons for the existence of our traditions 



The Appearance of Anomaly 237 


were rendered more explicit, however, perhaps we could develop 
greater intrapsychic and social integrity. The capacity to develop 
such understanding might help us use our capacity for reason to 
support, rather than destroy, the moral systems that discipline and 
protect us. 


INTRODUCTION: THE PARADIGMATIC STRUCTURE OF THE 

KNOWN 

The “known” is a hierarchical structure, composed of “walls within 
walls.” The individual sits at the middle of a series of concentric rings, 
composed of the integrated “personalities” of his ancestors, nested (at 
least in the ideal) within the figure of the exploratory hero. The inner 
walls are dependent for their protection—for their continued existence and 
validity—on the integrity of the outer walls. The farther “out” a given 
wall, the more “implicit” its structure—that is, the more it is incarnated in 
behavior and image, rather than explicit in word. Furthermore, the farther 
“out” the wall, the older the “personality,” the broader range of its 
applicability, and the greater the magnitude of emotion it holds in check. 

Groups—and individuals—may share some levels of the known, but not 
others. The similarities account for “shared group identity,” insofar as that 
exists; the differences, for the identification of the other with the forces of 
chaos. 

Rituals designed to strengthen group identity hold chaos at bay, 
but threaten individual identification with the exploratory hero—an 
identity upon which maintenance of the group ultimately depends. 

For the sake of the group, therefore, the individual must not be 
rendered subservient to the group. 

The aspects of things that are most important for us are hidden 
because of their simplicity and familiarity. (One is unable to notice 
something—because it is always before one’s eyes.) The real founda 
tions of his enquiry do not strike a man at all. Unless that fact has at 
some time struck him.—And this means: we fail to be struck by 
what, once seen, is most striking and powerful. ’ 7 ' 

A moral system—a system of culture—necessarily shares features in common with other 
systems. The most fundamental of the shared features of systems was identified by Kurt 
Godel. Godel’s Incompleteness Theorem demonstrated that any internally consistent and 
logical system of propositions must necessarily be predicated upon assumptions that 
cannot be proved from within the confines of that system. The philosopher of science 
Thomas Kuhn, discussing the progress of science, described similar implicit- 
presumption-ridden systems as paradigmatic. Explicitly scientific paradigmatic systems, 
the focus of Kuhn’s attention, are concerned with the prediction and control of events 
whose existence can be verified, in a particular formal manner, and offer “model

problems and solutions to a community of practitioners.” 76 Pre-experimental thinking— 
which primarily means moral thinking (thinking about the meaning or significance of 
events [objects and behaviors])—also appears necessarily characterized by paradigmatic 
structure. 

A paradigm is a complex cognitive tool, whose use presupposes acceptance of a 
limited number of axioms (or definitions of what constitutes reality, for the purposes of 
argument and action), whose interactions produce an internally consistent explanatory 
and predictive structure. Paradigmatic thinking might be described as thinking whose 
domain has been formally limited; thinking that acts “as if’ some questions have been 
answered in a final manner. The “limitations of the domain” or the “answers to the 
questions” make up the axiomatic statements of the paradigm, which are, according to 
Kuhn, “explicitly” formulated—semantically represented, according to the argument set 
forth here—or left “implicit”—embedded in (episodic) fantasy or embodied behavior. 
The validity of the axioms must either be accepted on faith, or (at least) demonstrated 
using an approach which is external to the paradigm in question (which amounts to the 
same thing as faith, from a “within-the-paradigm” perspective). 

In some regards, a paradigm is like a game. Play is optional, but, once undertaken, 
must be governed by (socially verified) rules. These rules cannot be questioned, while the 
game is on (or if they are, that is a different game. Children arguing about how to play 
football are not playing football. They are engaging, instead, in a form of philosophy). 
Paradigmatic thinking allows for comprehension of an infinity of “facts,” through 
application of a finite system of presuppositions—allows, in the final analysis, for the 
limited subject to formulate sufficient provisional understanding of the unlimited 
experiential object (including the subject). 

Human culture has, by necessity, a paradigmatic structure—devoted not toward 
objective description of what is, but to description of the cumulative affective relevance, 
or meaning, of what is. The capacity to determine the motivational relevance of an object 
or situation is dependent, in turn, upon representation of a (hypothetically) ideal state 
(conceived in constrast to conceptualization of the present), and upon generation of an 
action sequence designed to attain that ideal. It is (stated, unstated and unstatable) articles 
of faith that underlie this tripartite representation, and that keep the entire process in 
operation. These “articles of faith” are axioms of morality, so to speak—some explicit 
(represented declaratively, in image and word), most still implicit—which evolved in the 
course of human exploration and social organization, over the course of hundreds of 
thousands of years. In their purely implicit states, such axioms are extremely resistant to 
alteration. Once made (partially) explicit, however, moral axioms rapidly become subject 
to endless careful and thoughtful or casual careless debate. Such debate is useful, for 
continuance and extension of adaptation, but also very dangerous, as it is the continued 
existence of unchallenged moral axioms that keeps the otherwise unbearable significance 
of events constrained, and the possibility for untrammeled action alive. 

A paradigmatic structure provides for determinate organization of (unlimited) 
information, according to limited principles. The system of Euclidean geometry provides 
a classic example. The individual who wishes to generate a desired outcome of behavior, 
as a consequence of the application of Euclidean principles, is bound by necessity to 
accept certain axioms “on faith.” These axioms follow: 

1. A straight line segment can be drawn joining any two points. 



The Appearance of Anomaly 239 


2. Any straight line segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. 

3. Given any straight line segment, a circle can be drawn having the segment as radius 
and one end point as center. 

4. All right angles are congruent. 

5. If 2 lines are drawn which intersect a 3rd in such a way that the sum of the inner 
angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the 2 lines inevitably must 
intersect each other on that side if extended far enough. 77 

It is the interaction of each of the five initial postulates—which are all that necessarily 
have to be remembered, or understood, for geometry to prove useful—that gives rise to 
the internally consistent and logical Euclidean structure we are all familiar with. What 
constitutes truth, from within the perspective of this structure, can be established by 
reference to these initial postulates. However, the postulates themselves must be 
accepted. Their validity cannot be demonstrated, within the confines of the system. They 
might be “provable” from within the confines of another system, however—although the 
integrity of that system will still remain dependent, by necessity, on different postulates, 
down to an indeterminate end. The validity of a given structure appears necessarily 
predicated on “unconscious” presuppositions—the presupposition that space has three 
dimensions, in the case of Euclidean geometry (a presupposition which is clearly 
questionable). 

It appears, in many cases, that the assumptions of explicit semantic statements take 
episodic or imagistic form. The Euclidean postulates, for example, appear to be based 
upon “observable facts” (images of “the world of experience” as interpreted). Euclid 
grounded his explicit abstract (semantic) system in observable “absolutes.” It can be 
concretely demonstrated, for example, that any two points drawn in the sand can be 
joined by a given line. Repeated illustration of this “fact” appears (acceptably) 
convincing—as does, similarly, (“empirical”) demonstration that any straight line 
segment can be extended indefinitely in a straight line. These postulates (and the 
remaining three) cannot be proved from within the confines of geometry itself, but they 
appear true, and will be accepted as such, as a consequence of practical example. What 
this means is that belief in Euclidean presumptions is dependent upon acceptance of 
practical experience as sufficient certainty. The Euclidean draws a line in the sand, so to 
speak, and says “the questions stop here.” 

Similarly, it appears that what constitutes truth from the episodic perspective is 
predicated upon acceptance of the validity and sufficiency of specific procedural 
operations. How a thing is represented in episodic memory, for example—which is what 
a thing is, insofar as we know what it is—appears dependent upon how it was 
investigated and on the implicit “presuppositions” driving or limiting the behavioral 
strategies applied to it in the course of creative exploration. Kuhn states: 

Scientists can agree that a Newton, Lavoisier, Maxwell or Einstein has 
produced an apparently permanent solution to a group of outstanding 
problems and still disagree, sometimes without being aware of it, about 
the particular abstract characteristics that make those solutions permanent. 

They can, that is, agree in their identification of a paradigm without 
agreeing on, or even attempting to produce, a frill interpretation or 



Maps of meaning 240 


rationalization of it. Lack of a standard interpretation or of an agreed 
reduction to rules will not prevent a paradigm from guiding research. 

Normal science can be determined in part by the direct inspection of 
paradigms, a process that is often aided by but does not depend upon the 
formulation of rules and assumptions. Indeed, the existence of a paradigm 
need not even imply that any hill set of rules exists. 

He continues, in a footnote: 

Michael Polyani ’ 7 * has brilliantly developed a very similar theme, arguing 
that much of the scientist’s success depends upon “tacit knowledge,” i.e., 
upon knowledge that is acquired through practice and that cannot be 
articulated explicitly. 379 

The Euclidean draws a line connecting two points in the sand, and accepts on faith the 
sufficiency of that behavioral demonstration and the evident certainty of its outcome (in 
part, because no alternative conceptualization can presently be imagined). Euclidean 
geometry worked and was considered complete for centuries because it allowed for the 
prediction and control of all those experienceable phenomena that arose as a consequence 
of human activity, limited in its domain by past behavioral capacity. Two hundred years 
ago, we did not know how to act concretely, or think abstractly, in a manner that would 
produce some situation whose nature could not be described by Euclid. That is no longer 
the case. Many alternative, and more inclusive geometries have been generated during the 
course of the last century. These new systems describe the nature of “reality”—the 
phenomena that emerge as a consequence of ongoing behavior—more completely. 

All representations of objects (or situations, or behavioral sequences) are of course 
conditional, because they may be altered unpredictably, or even transformed, entirely, as 
a consequence of further exploration (or because of some spontaneous anomaly- 
emergence). The (anxiety-inhibiting, goal-specifying) model of the object of experience 
is therefore inevitably contingent —dependent, for its validity, on the maintenance of 
those (invisible) conditions which applied and those (unidentified) contexts which were 
relevant when the information was originally generated. Knowledge is mutable, in 
consequence—as Nietzsche observed: 

There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are 
“immediate certainties”; for example, “I think,” or as the superstition of 
Schopenhauer put it, “I will”; as though knowledge here got hold of its 
object purely and nakedly as “the thing in itself,” without any falsification 
on the part of either the subject or the object. But that “immediate 
certainty,” as well as “absolute knowledge” and “the thing in itself,” 
involve a contradictio in adjecto, I shall repeat a hundred times; we really 
ought to free ourselves from the seduction of words! 

Let the people suppose that knowledge means knowing things entirely; 
the philosopher must say to himself: When I analyze the process that is 
expressed in the sentence, “I think,” I find a whole series of daring 
assertions that would be difficult, perhaps impossible, to prove; for 



The Appearance of Anomaly 241 


example, that it is I who think, that there must necessarily be something 
that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the part of a being 
who is thought of as a cause, that there is an “ego,” and, finally, that it is 
already determined what is to be designated by thinking—that I know 
what thinking is. For if I had not already decided within myself what it is, 
by what standard could I determine whether that which is just happening 
is not perhaps “willing” or “feeling”? In short, the assertion “I think” 
assumes that I compare my state at the present moment with other states 
of myself which I know, in order to determine what it is; on account of 
this retrospective connection with tint her “knowledge,” it has, at any rate, 
no immediate certainty for me. 

In place of the “immediate certainty” in which the people may believe 
in the case at hand, the philosopher thus finds a series of metaphysical 
questions presented to him, truly searching questions of the intellect; to 
wit: “From where do I get the concept of thinking? Why do I believe in 
cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak of an ego, and even of 
an ego as a cause, and finally of an ego as the cause of thought?” Whoever 
ventures to answer these metaphysical questions at once by an appeal to a 
sort of intuitive perception, like the person who says, “I think, and know 
that this, at least, is true, actual, and certain”—will encounter a smile and 
two question marks from a philosopher nowadays. “Sir,” the philosopher 
will perhaps give him to understand, “it is improbable that you are not 
mistaken; but why insist on the truth?” 0 

The “object” always remains something capable of transcending the “bounds” of its 
representation; it is something that inevitably retains its mysterious essence, its 
connection with the unknown, and its potential for the inspiration of hope and fear. The 
“actual” or “transcendent” object, in and of itself, insofar as such a thing can be 
considered, is the sum total of its explored properties, plus that which remains 
unexplored—the unknown itself. 

Our understanding of a given phenomenon is always limited by the temporal, 
economic and technological resources that we have at our disposal. Knowledge is 
necessarily contingent, although it is neither less “objective,” necessarily, nor less 
“knowledge,” because of that. Our representations of objects (or situations, or behavioral 
sequences) are currently accepted as valid, because they serve their purposes as tools. If 
we can manipulate our models in imagination, apply the solutions so generated to the 
“real” world, and produce the outcome desired, we presume that our understanding is 
valid—and sufficient. It isn’t until we do something, and produce an unexpected 
outcome, that our models are deemed insufficient. This means that our current 
representations of a given phenomena are predicated on the (implicit) presumption that 
sufficient exploration of that phenomena has taken place. “Sufficient exploration” is a 
judgment rendered as a consequence of a sequence of action attaining its desired end 
(“what works” is “true”). A procedure is deemed sufficient when it attains its desired 
end—when it meets its goal. The nature of that goal, archetypally, is establishment of or 
movement toward a paradisal state characterized by stable, dynamic relief from 
(unbearable) suffering, freedom from (paralyzing) anxiety, abundance of hope, and 



Maps of meaning 242 


bountiful provision of primary reward—the peaceful land of “milk and honey,” in 
mythical language. This is merely to say that knowledge serves the ends of life, rather 
than existing in and of itself. 

Some contingent forms of knowledge—behaviors, say, and schemas of value—prove 
of lasting worth, producing the desired outcome across a broad range of contexts. These 
are “remembered”—stored in ritual and myth—and transmitted down the generations. 
Over the course of time, they become integrated with all other extant behaviors and 
schemas of value, in a hierarchy that allows for their various expression. This hierarchy, 
as described previously, is composed of the actions and valuations of past heroes, 
organized by other heroes into a stable social character, shared by all members of the 
same culture (as the Christian church constitutes the symbolic body of Christ). This 
hierarchy has been and currently is shaped by endless loops of affective feedback, as the 
means and goals chosen by each individual and the society at large are modified by the 
actions and reactions of society and the eternally ineradicable presence of the unknown 
itself. The resultant “hierarchy of motivation” can be most accurately characterized as a 
personality —the mythic “ancestral” figure that everyone imitates, consciously (with frill 
participation of the semantic and episodic system, rational thought and imagination) or 
unconsciously (in action only, despite express “disbelief’). The hierarchically structured 
behavioral pattern (personality) that constitutes culture comes, with the passage of time, 
to be represented secondarily, isormorphically, in episodic memory, and then coded 
explicitly insofar as current cognitive development makes that possible. The explicit 
moral code is therefore predicated upon presumptions which are valid purely from the 
episodic perspective; in turn, these episodic representations derive their validity from 
procedural knowledge, designed to meet affective requirements, in the social community 
and in the presence of the unknown. 

A moral philosophy, which is a pattern for behavior and interpretation, is therefore 
dependent for its existence upon a mythology, which is a collection of images of 
behaviors, which emerge, in turn, as a consequence of social interaction (cooperation and 
competition), designed to meet emotional demands. These demands take on what is 
essentially a universally constant and limited form, as a consequence of their innate 
psychobiological basis and the social expression of that basis. Hence (as implied 
previously) the limited “forms” of myth. Northrop Frye states, in this regard: 

I should distinguish primary and secondary concern, even though there is 
no real boundary line between them. Secondary concerns arise from the 
social contract, and include patriotic and other attachments of loyalty, 
religious beliefs, and class-conditioned attitudes and behaviors. They 
develop from the ideological aspect of myth, and consequently tend to be 
directly expressed in ideological prose language. In the mythical stage, 
they often accompany a ritual. Such a ritual may be designed, for 
example, to impress on a boy that he is to be admitted to the society of 
men in a ritual for men only; that he belongs to this tribe or group and not 
that one, a fact which will probably determine the nature of his marriage; 
that these and not those are his special totems or tutelary deities. 

Primary concerns may be considered in four main areas: food and 
drink, along with related bodily needs; sex; properly (i.e. money, 



The Appearance of Anomaly 243 


possessions, shelter, clothing and everything that constitutes property in 
the sense of what is “proper” to ones own life); liberty of movement. The 
general object of primary concern is expressed in the Biblical phrase “life 
more abundantly.” In origin, primary concerns are not individual or social 
in reference so much as generic, anterior to the conflicting claims of the 
singular and the plural. But as society develops they become the claims of 
the individual body as distinct from those of the body politic. A famine is 
a social problem, but only the individual starves. So a sustained attempt to 
express primary concerns can develop only in societies where the sense of 
individuality has also developed. The axioms of primary concerns are the 
simplest and baldest platitudes it is possible to formulate: that life is better 
than death, happiness better than misery; health better than sickness, 
freedom better than bondage, for all people without significant exception. 

What we have been calling ideologies are closely linked to secondary 
concerns, and in large measure consist of rationalizations of them. And 
the longer we look at myths, or storytelling patterns, the more clearly their 
links with primary concern stand out.... This rooting of poetic myth in 
primary concern accounts for the fact that mythical themes, as distinct 
from individual myths or stories, are limited in number. ' 81 

The (explicit) moral code is validated by reference to the (religious, mythic) narrative; the 
narrative is (primarily episodic) representation of behavioral tradition; the tradition 
emerges as a consequence of individual adaptation to the demands of natural conditions, 
manifest (universally) in emotion, generated in a social context. The episodic 
representation—which is representation of the outcome of a procedure and the procedure 
itself—is predicated upon belief in the sufficiency and validity of that procedure; more 
subtly, it has the same structure—at least insofar as it is an accurate representation of 
behavior—and therefore contains the (implicit) hierarchical structure of historically 
determined procedural knowledge in more explicit form. 

Over lengthy historical periods, therefore, the “image” ever more accurately 
encapsulates the behavior, and stories find their compelling essential form. Frye states, 
with regard to the process underlying “construction” of the Old and New Testaments: 

The Bible’s literary unity is a by-product of something else—we might 
call it an unconscious by-product if we knew anything at all about the 
mental processes involved. The earlier part of the Old Testament, with its 
references to the Book of Jasher and the like, gives the effect of having 
distilled and fermented a rich poetic literature to extract a different kind of 
verbal essence, and on a smaller scale the same process can be seen in the 
New Testament.... The editorial work done on this earlier poetic material 
was not an attempt to reduce it from poetry to a kind of plain prose sense, 
assuming that there is such a thing. This kind of sense implies a direct 
appeal to credulity, to the infantilism which is so exasperating a feature of 
popular religious and other ideologies. What we have is rather an 
absorption of a poetic and mythic presentation that takes us past myth to 



Maps of meaning 244 


something else. In doing so it will elude those who assume that myth 
means only something that did not happen. 382 

The second-order semantic codification is grounded in the episodic representation; tends, 
over time, to duplicate the hierarchical structure of that representation; and is predicated 
upon acceptance of the validity of the procedural and episodic memories. Semantic, 
episodic and procedural contents therefore share (in the intrapsychically integrated, 
“conscious” or psychologically healthy individual) identical hierarchical structure, in 
their respective forms of action or representation. This integrated morality lends 
predictability to individual and interpersonal behavior, constitutes the basis for the stable 
state, and helps ensure that emotion remains controlled and regulated. 

Figure 47: The Paradigmatic Structure of the Known presents the “personality” of a 
typical Western individual—in this case, a middle-class businessman and father. His 
individual life is nested within an increasingly transpersonal, shared “personality,” with 
deep, increasingly implicit historical roots. The “smaller stories,” nested within the 
larger, are dependent for their continued utility on maintenance of the larger—as the 
middle-class family, for example, is dependent for its economic stability on the capitalist 
system, as the capitalist system is nested in humanistic Western thought, as humanism is 
dependent on the notion of the inherent value of the individual (on the notion of 
“individual rights”), and as the inherent value of the individual is dependent on his 
association, or ritual identification, with the exploratory communicative hero. The more 
encompassing “outer” levels of organization may be extant purely in behavior—that is, 
the individual in question may have little or no explicit imagistic or semantic knowledge 
of his historical roots, although he still “acts out” a 



The Appearance of Anomaly 245 



Figure 47: The Paradigmatic Structure of the Known 

historically conditioned personality. It is certainly possible, as well—and is increasingly 
the norm—for an individual to deny explicit “belief’ in the validity of the Judeo- 
Christian ethic or the existence of any transpersonal “exploratory hero” whatsoever. This 
denial, at the explicit (verbalizable) level of “consciousness” merely interferes with the 
integrity of the personality in question. The procedural aspect that largely constitutes 
Judeo-Christian belief (for example)—and even ritual identification with the hero, to 
some degree (the “imitation of Christ”)—almost inevitably remains intact (at least in the 
case of the “respectable citizen”). The modern educated individual therefore “acts out” 
but does not “believe.” It might be said that the lack of isomorphism between explicit 
abstract self-representation and actions undertaken in reality makes for substantial 
existential confusion—and for susceptibility to sudden dominance by any ideology 
providing a “more complete” explanation. Equally or even more troublesome is the 
tendency of lack of explicit “belief’ to manifest itself, slowly, in 





Maps of meaning 246

Individuals 

alteration of imagistic representation and behavior (as ideas change actions, over time) 
and to “invisibly” undermine intrapsychic and social stability. 

Groups and individuals may differ in their goals, values and behaviors at one level of 
analysis, while sharing features in common at “higher,” more implicit levels. Figure 48: 
The Known: Nested Groups and Individuals portrays three such groups. This number is 
arbitrary: Catholic, Protestant and Greek Orthodox Christians, for example, might all be 
regarded as enveloped by their participation in the Judeo-Christian “personality”; 
although they may well fight among themselves, at the drop of a hat (“within” the 
confines of that personality), they are liable to eagerly join forces, to eliminate a threat, 
real or perceived, from Jews or Muslims. Within each of these three groups there are 
going to be differences and similarities, as well. Each community of believers is likely to 
have its separate sects, separated from one another by a certain historical duration (and 
the alterations in value structure and behavior that accompany such divergence). Finally, 
individuals within groups will diverge, too, according to their individual interests and 
idiosyncratic beliefs. (Paradoxically, it is fidelity to these individual characteristics that 
most truly unites all persons in “worship” of the exploratory hero. This means that the 



The Appearance of Anomaly 247 


innermost “level” of personality organization—that aspect which is truly unique, rather 
than shared—is also the outer level, upon which the stability of the entire structure 
depends.) 

The emergence of anomaly—the “re-emergence of the Great Mother”—constitutes a 
threat to the integrity of the moral tradition governing behavior and evaluation. It is for 
this reason that adjustment to anomaly—in the many “mythologically equivalent” forms 
it takes—is frequently resisted passively (by “failure to take it into account”) and 
aggressively (by attempts to eradicate its source). Anomalies may have their effect at 
different “levels,” as we have seen. The most profound threats undermine the stability of 
the “personalities” that encompass the largest number of people, have the deepest 
historical roots, are most completely grounded in image and behavior—are most broadly 
applicable, regardless of situation (“cover” the largest possible span of time and space). 
We seem “aware,” in some sense, of the danger of profound anomalies, perhaps because 
a substantial amount of negative emotion and abstract cognitive consideration can be 
elicited merely through positing their possibility (“what if we were truly threatened by 
the foreign devils?”). Our tendency to personally identify with our respective countries, 
say—to foster and be proud of our patriotism—reflects “knowledge” that our personal 
integrity and security is integrally bound up, for better or worse, with the destiny of our 
cultures. We are therefore motivated to protect those cultures, to defend our societies and 
ourselves against the “return of the terrible Dragon of Chaos.” [It is frequently the case, 
however, that our attempts to bolster the security of part of our protective identity 
undermine our stability at a higher order of being. The “American (British, Russian, 
Chinese) Way of Life,” for example, is a more visible (and less personally demanding) 
figure than the exploratory hero—although it is also a less critically important part of our 
core cultural and personal identities. This means that attempts to increase the strength of 
the state at the cost of the individual are counterproductive, even though they may serve 
to heighten the sense of order and regulate emotion in the short term. Patriotism—or any 
similar attempt at strengthening group identity—must necessarily be bounded by supreme 
regard for the creative capacity of the individual.] 

The individual is protected from chaos in its hill manifestation by the many “walls” 
that surround him. All the space outside a given wall, however—despite its probable 
encapsulation by additional protective structures—appears relatively dangerous to anyone 
currently within that wall. All “outside territory” evokes fear. This “equivalence” does 
not mean, however, that all threats are equivalently potent—-just that anything “outside” 
shares the capacity to frighten (or enlighten) anything “inside.” Challenges posed to the 
“highest” levels of order are clearly the most profound, and are likely to engender the 
most thorough reactions. Observation of response to such threats may be complicated, 
however, by the problem of time frame: challenge posed to extremely “implicit” 
personalities may evoke reactions that extend over centuries, in the form of abstract 
exploration and argumentation, revision of action, and war between opposing alternative 
viewpoints (as in the case, for example, of the Catholic and Protestant Christians). The 
fact that threats posed to the “highest” levels of order are the most profound is 
complicated, to say it another way, by the “implicitness” of those levels, and their 
“invisibility.” Furthermore, the structures nested within a given personality may have 
enough intrinsic strength to stand for a long while after the outer walls that protected 
them and provided them with structural integrity have been breached and destroyed. The 



Maps of meaning 248 


stability of a political or social structure once nested in a damaged religious 
preconception might be likened to a building standing after an earthquake: superficially, 
it looks intact, but one more minor shake may be sufficient to bring it crashing down. The 
“death of God” in the modern world looks like an accomplished fact, and perhaps an 
event whose repercussions have not proved fatal. But the existential upheaval and 
philosophical uncertainty characteristic of the first three-quarters of the twentieth century 
demonstrate that we have not yet settled back on firm ground. Our current miraculous 
state of relative peace and economic tranquillity should not blind us to the fact that 
gaping holes remain in our spirits. 

The chaos “hidden” or given form by the establishment of temporal order may 
remanifest itself at any time. It may do so in a number of guises, of apparent diversity. 
Any re-emergence of chaos, however—whatever the reason—may be regarded as the 
same sort of event, from the perspective of emotion, motivational significance or 
meaning. This is to say that all things that threatens the status quo, regardless of their 
“objective” features, tends to be placed into the same “natural category,” as a 
consequence of their affective identity. The barbarian at the gates is therefore 
indistinguishable from the heretic within; both are equivalent to the natural disaster, to 
the disappearance of the hero, and to the emergent senility of the king. The “re- 
emergence of the Dragon of Chaos,” whatever his form, constitutes the unleashing of 
dangerous, fear-producing (and promising) potential. The different “guises” of this 
potential, and the reasons for and nature of their equivalence, constitute our next topic of 
discussion. The nature of the response evoked by that potential provide subject matter for 
the remainder of the book. 


PARTICULAR FORMS OF ANOMALY: THE STRANGE, THE 
STRANGER, THE STRANGE IDEA AND THE 
REVOLUTIONARY HERO 

Anomalous events share capacity to threaten the integrity of the known, to 
disrupt the “familiar and explored.” Such events, while differing in their 
specific details and manner of manifestation, tend to occupy the same 
natural category. Threats to the stability of cultural tradition emerge in 
four “mythologically inseparable” manners: through rapid natural 
environmental shift, “independent” of human activity; through contact 
with a heretofore isolated foreign culture; through application of novel 
(revolutionary) linguistically or episodically mediated critical skill—the 
inevitable consequence of increasing ability to abstract, learn and 
communicate; and as a consequence of revolutionary heroic activity. 

The “natural” human tendency to respond to the stranger, the 
strange idea and the creative individual with fear and aggression 
can be more easily comprehended, once it is understood that these 
diverse phenomena share categorical identity with the “natural 
disaster.” The problem with this “natural” response pattern, 
however, is that the upsetting capacity of the anomalous is 
simultaneously the vital source of interest, meaning and individual 



The Appearance of Anomaly 249 


strength. Furthermore, the ability to upset ourselves—to undermine 
and revitalize our own beliefs—is an intrinsic, necessary and 
“divine” aspect of the human psyche (part of the seminal “Word” 
itself). 

The Word—in its guise as painstakingly abstracted action and 
object—can create new worlds and destroy old; can pose an 
unbearable threat to seemingly stable cultures, and can redeem 
those that have become senescent, inflexible and paralytic. 

To those who have sold their souls to the group, however, the 
Word is indistinguishable from the enemy. 

The Strange 

Transformation of “environmental” circumstances, as the consequence of purely natural 
causes, constitutes the single most immediately evident cause for the deterioration of 
cultural stability. Prolonged drought, floods, earthquakes, plagues—nature’s most 
horrifying and arbitrary occurrences—are capable of rendering the most carefully adapted 
societies impotent at a single blow. 

Natural disasters of this sort might merely be considered rapid transformation— 
situations where previously noted affectively relevant environmental relationships alter 
faster than adaptive movement keeps pace. This means that the insufficiency of cultural 
adaptation cannot easily be distinguished from natural catastrophe. A society light on its 
feet, so to speak, is constantly in a position to adapt to the unexpected—even the 
catastrophic—and to transform such change into something beneficial (consider, for 
example, the postwar Japanese). The relationship “natural disaster/cultural adaptation” 
therefore constitutes the social analogue to that obtaining between “emotion” and 
“cognition”: affect generated, in large part, as a consequence of novelty, always emerges 
where something is not known (and is therefore always dependent on what is known); is 
always experienced in relationship to some conceptualization of the present, the future 
and the means to get from one to the other. What constitutes “novelty,” then, is dependent 
on what is not novel in a particular circumstance. What constitutes “trauma” depends, 
likewise, on the behavioral repertoire and value schema available for use at the time of a 
given event or transformation. A blizzard that would incapacitate Washington for a 
month barely makes the residents of Montreal blink. 

Mythic representations of the rapid mutation of environmental contingency (portrayed 
as the reappearance of the Great Mother or the Dragon of Chaos) are in consequence 
necessarily “contaminated” with images of the sterile, senescent or tyrannical king, 
whose inflexibility renders all inevitable environmental transformation deadly. When is a 
disaster not a disaster? When the community is prepared to respond appropriately. 
Conversely, any minor change in the natural world might be regarded as terminal, 
catastrophic—and actually be so—when the adaptive structure designed to fit that world 
has become so authoritarian that any change whatsoever is reflexively deemed forbidden, 
heretical.’ 8 ’ A society with this attitude—such as the former Soviet Union—is an 
accident waiting to happen. An interesting example of the consequences of such 
inflexibility, on the personal scale, is offered by Kuhn: 



Maps of meaning 250 


In a psychological experiment that deserves to be far better known outside 
the trade, Bruner and Postman 384 asked experimental subjects to identify 
on short and controlled exposure a series of playing cards. Many of the 
cards were normal, but some were made anomalous, e.g., a red six of 
spades and a black four of hearts. Each experimental run was constituted 
by the display of a single card to a single subject in a series of gradually 
increased exposures. After each exposure the subject was asked what he 
had seen, and the run was terminated by two successive correct 
identifications. 

Even on the shortest exposures many subjects identified most of the 
cards, and after a small increase all the subjects identified them all. For 
the normal cards these identifications were usually correct, but the 
anomalous cards were almost always identified, without apparent 
hesitation or puzzlement, as normal. The black four of hearts might, for 
example, be identified as the four of either spades or hearts. Without any 
awareness of trouble, it was immediately fitted to one of the conceptual 
categories prepared by prior experience. One would not even like to say 
that the subjects had seen something different from what they identified. 

With a further increase of exposure to the anomalous cards, subjects did 
begin to hesitate and to display awareness of anomaly. Exposed, for 
example, to the red six of spades, some would say: “That’s the six of 
spades, but there’s something wrong with it—the black has a red border.” 

Further increase of exposure resulted in still more hesitation and 
confusion until finally, and sometimes quite suddenly, most subjects 
would produce the correct identification without hesitation. Moreover, 
after doing this with two or three of the anomalous cards, they would have 
little further difficulty with the others. A few subjects, however, were 
never able to make the requisite adjustment of their categories. Even at 
forty times the average exposure required to recognize normal cards for 
what they were, more than 10 per cent of the anomalous cards were not 
correctly identified. And the subjects who then failed often experienced 
acute personal distress. One of them exclaimed: “I can’t make the suit out, 
whatever it is. It didn’t even look like a card that time. I don’t know what 
color it is now or whether it’s a spade or a heart. Em not even sure now 
what a spade looks like. My God!” 385 

Myth and literature constantly represent the “parched kingdom,” the society victimized 
(most frequently) by drought—which is the absence of water, concretely, and the “water 
of life” or spirit, symbolically—brought on by the over-prolonged dominance of the 
(once great) ruling idea. This idea, in the narrative (and frequently, in actuality), is the 
king, the ancestral spirit, representative of his people, made tyrannical by age, pride, or 
unbearable disappointment, withering under the influence of some willfully 
misunderstood malevolent advising force. The development of such an unpleasant and 
dangerous situations calls, of course, for the entrance of the hero: the “lost son” of the 
true king, raised in secrecy by alternative parents; the rightful ruler of the kingdom, 
whose authority was undermined or who was supposedly killed during vulnerable youth; 



The Appearance of Anomaly 251 


the proper heir to the throne, who had been journeying in far-off lands and was presumed 
dead. The hero overturns the tyrant and regains his proper place; the gods, pleased by the 
re-establishment of proper order, allow the rain once more to fall (or stop it from falling 
in dangerous excess). In a story of this type, the creative aspect of the unknown (nature) 
is “locked away,” metaphorically, by the totalitarian opinion of the current culture. Such 
a state of affairs might be represented, for example, by the sleeping princess, in the 
kingdom brought to a standstill (or by some alternative variant of the existence of the 
“treasure hard to attain” ). Paralyzed by patriarchal despotism (or, frequently, by fear 
of the Terrible Mother), the kingdom remains stagnant, while the princess—nature, in her 
benevolent guise—waits for the kiss of the hero to wake. Her awakened and revitalized 
beauty subsequently reanimates her people. 

Rituals of the death and renewal of the king act out this transformation of cultural 
adaptation long before the concept of rebirth can be rendered abstractly comprehensible. 
Frye states: 

The hypothetical ritual studied in Frazer’s Golden Bough may be 
vulnerable enough in various anthropological contexts, but as a mythical 
structure it is as solid as the pyramids. Here a king regarded as divine is 
put to death at the height of his powers, for fear that his physical 
weakening will bring a corresponding impotence to the fertility of the land 
he rules.... When sacrificed, the divine king is immediately replaced by a 
successor, and his body is then eaten and his blood drunk in a ritual 
ceremony. We have to make a rather violent effort of visualization to see 
that there are now two bodies of the divine king, one incarnate in the 
successor, the other concealed in the bellies of his worshippers. The latter 
causes the society to become, through eating and drinking the same 
person, integrated into a single body, which is both their own and his. 388 

The extensive and universal corpus of dying-and-resurrecting-god myths 389 (acted in 
sacrificial ritual) dramatize two notions. The first is that the actual ideas/patterns of 
behavior governing adaptation must die and be reborn to ensure constant update of the 
techniques of survival. The second, more fundamental, is that the hero—the active agent 
of adaptation—must eternally upset the protective structure of tradition and enter into 
“sacrificial union” with the re-emergent unknown. Cosmological phenomena themselves 
“act out” (are utilized as descriptive tools for, more accurately) this eternal drama: the 
sun (god), born in the east, “dies” in the west, and passes into the underworld of night 
(into the lair of the dragon of chaos). Nightly, the sun hero battles the terrible forces of 
chaos, cuts himself out of the belly of the beast and is reborn triumphant in the morning. 

The master of the strange in its “natural form” is the hero in his technological guise 
(more particularly, say, than in his role as social revolutionary). Marduk, who faced 
Tiamat in single combat, is a very focused representative of man’s “mastery” over nature. 
The pattern of action signified by this god—that is, courageous and creative approach in 
the face of uncertainty—was regarded “unconsciously” by the Mesopotamians as 
necessary, as stated previously, to the “creation of ingenious things” from the “conflict 
with Tiamat.” 390 The hero fashions defenses out of nature to use against nature. This idea, 



Maps of meaning 252 


which underlies man’s cultural adaptation, manifests itself “naturally” in the human 
psyche: 


Spontaneous fantasy manifested August 10, 1997, by my daughter, 
Mikhaila (age five years, eight months) while playing “prince and 
princess’’ with Julian (her three-year-old brother): Dad, if we killed a 
dragon, we could use his skin as armor, couldn’t we? Wouldn’t that be a 
good idea? 

The hero uses the positive aspect of the Great Mother as protection from her negative 
counterpart. In this manner, the “natural disaster” is kept at bay or, better yet, transformed 
from a crisis into an opportunity. 


The Stranger 

Arrival of the stranger, concretely presented in mythology, constitutes a threat “to the 
stability of the kingdom,” metaphorically indistinguishable from that posed by 
“environmental transformation.” The stable meaning of experiential events, constrained 
by the hierarchical structure of group identity, is easily disrupted by the presence of the 
“other,” who practically poses a concrete threat to the stability of the present dominance 
structure, and who, more abstractly—as his actions “contain” his moral tradition—exists 
as the literal embodiment of challenges to the a priori assumptions guiding belief. The 
stranger does not act in the manner expected. His inherent unpredictability renders him 
indistinguishable from the unknown, as such, and easily identified with the force 
constantly working to undermine order. From a within-group perspective, so to speak, 
such identification is not purely arbitrary, either, as the mere existence of the (successful) 
stranger poses serious threat to the perceived utility of the general culture—and, 
therefore, to its ability to inhibit existential terror and provide determinate meaning to 
action. 

When the members of one isolated group come into contact with the members of 
another, the stage is therefore set for trouble. Each culture, each group, evolved to protect 
its individual members from the unknown—from the abysmal forces of the Great and 
Terrible Mother, from unbearable affect itself. Each evolved to structure social 
relationships and render them predictable, to provide a goal and the means to attain it. All 
cultures provide their constituent individuals with particular modes of being in the face of 
terror and uncertainty. All cultures are stable, integrated, hierarchically arranged 
structures predicated upon assumptions held as absolute—but the particular natures of 
these assumptions differ (at least at the more comprehensible and “conscious” levels of 
analyses). Every culture represents an idiosyncratic paradigm, a pattern of behaving in 
the face of the unknown, and the paradigm cannot be shifted (its basic axioms cannot be 
modified), without dramatic consequences—without dissolution, metaphoric death— 
prior to (potential) reconstruction. 

Every society provides protection from the unknown. The unknown itself is a 
dangerous thing, hill of unpredictability and threat. Chaotic social relationships 
(destructured dominance hierarchies) create severe anxiety and dramatically heighten the 
potential for interpersonal conflict. Furthermore, the dissolution of culturally determined 



The Appearance of Anomaly 253 


goals renders individual life, identified with those goals, meaningless and unrewarding in 
intrinsic essence. It is neither reasonable nor possible to simply abandon a particular 
culture, which is a pattern of general adaptation, just because someone else comes along 
who does things a different way, whose actions are predicated on different assumptions. 
It is no simple matter to rebuild social relationships in the wake of new ideas. It is no 
straightforward process, furthermore, to give up a goal, a central unifying and motivating 
idea. Identification of an individual with a group means that individual psychological 
stability is staked on maintenance of group welfare. If the group founders suddenly as a 
consequence of external circumstance or internal strife, the individual is laid bare to the 
world, his social context disappears, his reason for being vanishes, he is swallowed up by 
the unbearable unknown, and he cannot easily survive. Nietzsche states: 

In an age of disintegration that mixes races indiscriminately, human 
beings have in their bodies the heritage of multiple origins, that is, 
opposite, and often not merely opposite, drives and value standards that 
fight each other and rarely permit each other any rest. Such human beings 
of late cultures and refracted lights will on the average be weaker human 
beings: their most profound desire is that the war they are should come to 
an end. 391 

Of course, the unstated conclusion to Nietzsche’s observation is that the war typifying the 
person of “mixed race” (mixed culture, in more modern terminology) is the affectively 
unpleasant precursor to the state of mind characterizing the more thoroughly integrated 
individual, who has “won” the war. This “victor”—who has organized the currently 
warring diverse cultural standpoints into a hierarchy, integrated once more—will be 
stronger than his “unicultural” predecessor, as his behavior and values will be the 
consequence of the more diverse and broader ranging union of heretofore separate 
cultures. It is reasonable to presuppose that it was the “unconscious” consideration of the 
potentially positive outcome of such mixing that led Nietzsche to the revelation of the 
dawning future “superman.” 392 It is not the mere existence of various previously 
separated presuppositions in a single psyche that constitutes the postcontact victory, 
however. This means that the simplistic promotion of “cultural diversity” as panacea is 
likely to produce anomie, nihilism and conservative backlash. It is the molding of these 
diverse beliefs into a single hierarchy that is precondition for the peaceful admixture of 
all. This molding can only be accomplished by war conducted between paradoxical 
elements, within the “postcontact” individual psyche. Such a war is so difficult—so 
emotionally upsetting and cognitively challenging—that murder of the anomalous 
“other” in the morally acceptable guise of traditional war frequently seems a comforting 
alternative. 

Fundamental threats can be posed very easily between groups of people. Most 
concretely, foreign behaviors are threatening, unpredictable in particular, terrifying in 
general—because essential beliefs, challenging beliefs, are most convincingly expressed 
through actions: 

He became to us a reproof of our thoughts; 



Maps of meaning 254 


the very sight of him is a burden to us, because his manner of life is 
unlike that of others, and his ways are strange. (Wisdom 2:14-15 RSV) 

A foreign man, a stranger, is threatening because he is not firmly fixed within a social 
hierarchy, and may therefore behave unpredictably—with unpredictable consequences 
for the social hierarchy. Signals of safety and threat vary, or may vary, between members 
of different groups. Unpredictable means potentially dangerous. More abstractly, what 
the stranger believes, specifically, threatens the integrated structure of historically 
determined belief, in general. This does not present a problem, when his foreign actions 
or ideas do not produce fundamental conflict—do not threaten key beliefs. When basic 
concepts are threatened, however, the unbearable, terrible unknown once again rises up, 
and once-firm ground begins to give way. 


The Strange Idea 

Increasing ability to abstract makes previous learning, established through nonabstract 
means, increasingly modifiable—and increasingly vulnerable. In a way, this is the whole 
point of abstraction, and the very capacity to learn. Words, deceptively simple and 
harmless, are sufficient to create disruption and conflict, because Homo sapiens can 
verbalize his beliefs. It could be said, therefore, with sufficient rationale that a new idea is 
an abstract stranger (or, by the same logic, a natural disaster). It is for this reason that 
the pen is mightier than the sword. 

The process of increased abstraction allows for increasing self-understanding (self- 
consciousness)—at least in potential—and for the prediction of the behaviors of others 
[which is a capacity integrally linked to the development of self-consciousness (how 
would I behave in a situation like that?)]. In addition, abstraction eases communication of 
morality (instruction in how to behave), by making it unnecessary to wait around to 
watch until something important actually happens. The use of drama, for example— 
which is the representation of behavior, in behavior and image —allows us to watch the 
interplay of issues of mortal consequence, without the actors or the observers actually 
suffering that consequence. 

The capacity to abstract has not come without price, however. The incautious, 
imaginative (and resentful) can easily use their gift of socially constructed intelligence to 
undermine moral principles that took eons to generate and that exist for valid but 
invisible reasons. Such “invisible” principles can be subjected to facile criticism, by the 
historically ignorant, once they take imagistic, written or spoken form. The consequence 
of this “criticism” is the undermining of necessary faith, and the consequent dissolution 
of interpersonal predictability, dys-regulation of emotion, and generation of anomie, 
aggression and ideological gullibility (as the naked psyche strives to clothe itself, once 
again). 

The danger of such criticism can be more particularly appreciated when the effect of 
what might be described as cascade is considered. We can change our behaviors because 
we change how we think—although this is not as simple as is generally considered. We 
can change how we think, facilely, and without regard for the consequences, partly 
because we do not understand why we think what we think (because all the facts that 
govern our behavior are not at our “conscious” disposal) and because the effects of that 



The Appearance of Anomaly 255 


change are often not immediately apparent. The fact that changes in tradition have 
unintended and often dangerous “side effects” accounts for the conservatism of most 
human cultures. “Cascade” means that threat to the perceived validity of any 
presupposition, at any level (procedural, imagistic or episodic, explicit or semantic) 
threatens all levels simultaneously. This means that the casual criticism 



Figure 49: The Fragmentary Representation of 

“Procedure and Custom” in Image and 
Word 

of a given explicit presupposition can come, over time, to undermine the unconscious 
imagistic and procedural personality and the emotional stability that accompanies it. 
Words have a power that belie their ease of use. 

Figure 49: The Fragmentary Representation of “Procedure and Custom” in Image 
and Word provides a schematic representation of the organization of behavior and 
schemas of value in “memory.” Customs—that is, predictable and stable patterns of 
behavior—emerge and are stored “procedurally” as a consequence of constant social 
interaction, over time, and as a result of the exchange of emotional information that 
characterizes that interaction. You modify me, I modify you, we both modify others, and 
so on, in a cycle that involves thousands of individuals, over thousands of years. Most of 
this information is a more or less permanent part of the social network (is part of the 
structure of society), but can become represented in part or whole in image, and then 









Maps of meaning 256 


more explicitly, in verbal code. The imagistic representation of the morality constituting a 
given society is likely to be incomplete, as the complexity of the patterns emerging 
consequential to the totality of social interaction exceeds (current) representational 
capacity. The semantic representations perched above the images are likely to be even 
more incomplete. This means that the verbal systems utilized in abstract thinking, for 
example, contain only “part of the puzzle,” at best; they have only partial information 
regarding the structure of the whole. So, while some of the rales governing behavior have 
become completely explicit and understood, others will remain partially implicit (and 
poorly understood). Some of these partially implicit rales are likely to exist for 
completely implicit (and therefore completely invisible) reasons. It is rules like these on 
the ragged edge of comprehension that are likely to attract ill-informed but nonetheless 
potentially devastating criticism. Abstract verbal intelligence may therefore pick holes in 
the “absurd mythological structure” that supports it, without understanding either that it is 
supported, or that the act of undermining is existentially—mortally—dangerous. It is easy 
to criticize the notion of the “immortal soul,” for example, and the traditional forms of 
morality that tend to accompany such a belief, without realizing that there is much more 
to the idea than meets the eye. 

“Cascade” means that threat to the perceived validity of any presupposition, at any 
level—generally verbally mediated—now becomes threat to that presupposition and to 
everything that rests on it. The socially mediated capacity to abstract—to reason and 
represent in behavior, imagination and word—means that an ill-chosen action, fantasy or 
thought may have devastating consequences. This is true in particular of the word. One 
well-chosen phrase can change everything (“from each according to his ability...”). The 
word, in a particular context (one established by behavior and episodic representation) 
has a polysemous significance—it excludes more (constrains more) than it appears to and 
means more than it “contains,” considered as an isolated or decontextualized element. It 
has this capacity in part because it is capable of referring to phenomena outside its 
domain, in order to make itself understood (this is use of metaphor). The word brings to 
mind events and actions, sequenced in a particular manner; it is the imaginary 
presentation of these events and actions that contains much of the meaning—the words 
merely act as cues for retrieval. The information retrieved is not necessarily yet semantic; 
it may still remain embodied in episodic memory and procedure. The polysemous quality 
of the meaningful word, which implies something for imagistic representation and for the 
structuring of behavior, is what makes it potent and dangerous. An entire behavioral 
hierarchy can be undermined by a well-chosen creative phrase, because the phrase brings 
with it, as integral part of an integrated whole, moral presuppositions of entirely different, 
and perhaps logically (or at least apparently) contrary nature. 

There is an apocryphal story about a cosmologist, lecturing to a rural audience of 
laypeople in the late 1800s. He describes the basic structure of the solar system, laying 
emphasis on the fact that the earth floats unsupported in space, endlessly circling the sun. 
After the lecture, an old woman approaches the podium and says: 

“That was a very interesting story, young man. Of course, it is completely 

absurd.” 

“Absurd, madam?” the lecturer inquired. “Whatever do you mean?” 



The Appearance of Anomaly 257 


“It is a well-known fact,” replied the old woman, “that the earth rests 
on the back of a giant turtle.” 

“Is that so, ma’am. What, then, does the turtle rest on?” 

“Don’t play games with me, young man,” responded the matron. “It’s 
turtles all the way down.” 393 

Douglas Hofstadter presented a similar idea in a fictional discussion between Achilles, 
the Greek hero, and a tortoise (of Zeno’s paradox fame): 

Tortoise: ...For purposes of illustration, let me suggest that you consider the simpler 
statement “29 is prime.” Now in fact, this statement really means that 2 times 2 is not 
29, and 5 times 6 is not 29, and so forth, doesn’t it? 

Achilles: It must, I suppose. 

Tortoise: But you are perfectly happy to collect all such facts together, and attach them in 
a bundle to the number 29, saying merely, “29 is prime?” 

Achilles: Yes... 

Tortoise: And the number of facts involved is actually infinite, isn’t it? After all, such 
facts as “4444 times 3333 is not 29” are all part of it, aren’t they? 

Achilles: Strictly speaking, I suppose so. But you and I both know that you can’t produce 
29 by multiplying two numbers which are both bigger than 29. So in reality, saying 
“29 is prime” is only summarizing a FINITE number of facts about multiplication. 
Tortoise: You can put it that way if you want, but think of this: the fact that two numbers 
which are bigger than 29 can’t have a product equal to 29 involves the entire 
structure of the number system. In that sense, that fact in itself is a summary of an 
infinite number of facts. You can’t get away from the fact, Achilles, that when you 
say “29 is prime,” you are actually stating an infinite number of things. 

Achilles: Maybe so, but it feels like just one fact to me. 

Tortoise: That’s because an infinitude of facts are contained in your prior knowledge— 
they are embedded implicitly in the way you visualize things. You don’t see an 
explicit infinity because it is captured implicitly inside the images you manipulate. 394 

Jerome Bruner’s comments on “triggers” are equally apropos here. He gives the 
following sentences as examples: Trigger: “John saw/didn’t see the chimera.” 
Presupposition: “There exists a chimera.” Trigger: “John realized/didn’t realize he was 
broke.” Presupposition: “John was broke.” Trigger: “John managed/didn’t manage to 
open the door.” Presupposition: “John tried to open the door.” There “exists” a virtually 
infinite number of “presuppositions” for every “trigger.” Bruner states: “Obviously you 
cannot press a reader (or a listener) to make endless interpretations of your obscure 
remarks. But you can go a surprisingly long way—provided only that you start with 
something approximating what Joseph Campbell called a “mythologically instructed 
community.” 395 The transmission of what is generally regarded as spiritual wisdom is in 
fact able to take (to be “reduced to”) narrative form precisely because the word—in the 
context of the story, which is description of episodic representation of events and 
behaviors—has this deceptively simple, yet infinitely meaningful “triggering” property: 



Maps of meaning 258 


Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is 
like to a grain of mustard seed, which a man took, and sowed in his field: 

Which indeed is the least of all seeds: but when it is grown, it is the 
greatest among herbs, and becometh a tree, so that the birds of the air 
come and lodge in the branches thereof. 

Another parable spake he unto them; The kingdom of heaven is like 
unto leaven, which a woman took, and hid in three measures of meal, till 
the whole was leavened. 

All these things spake Jesus unto the multitude in parables; and without 
a parable spake he not to them: 

That it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, I 
will open my mouth in parables; I will utter things which have been kept 
secret from the foundation of the world. (Matthew 13:31-35) 

It is not merely the story which is saturated with meaning; it is imagination, behavior and 
the practical consequences of imagination and behavior, as well. The individual ideas, 
particular fantasies and personal actions of individuals presuppose the culture from which 
they are derived. The word, in meaningful context, is meaningful precisely because it 
provides information relevant to episodic representation, per se, and because it has 
relevance—which may not be “consciously" comprehensible or declarable—for 
behavior. Likewise, the behavior and fantasies of self and other—in context—are 
predicated upon culturally determined values and beliefs, and could be said, in a manner 
of speaking, to contain them. It is for this reason that Jung could claim, with regard to the 
fantasies of a modern dreamer: 

He is in fact an unconscious exponent of an autonomous psychic 
development, just like the medieval alchemist or the classical 
Neoplatonist. Hence one could say —cum grano salis —that history could 
be constructed just as easily from one’s own unconscious as from the 
actual texts. 396 

Even the more concrete implement or tool—like the word—is not an artifact separable 
from the culture in which it is produced. It is failure to comprehend this fact that dooms 
many well-meaning “foreign aid" projects and, no less, the foreigners to which such aid 
is granted. Even something as simple as the shovel or hoe presupposes the existence of a 
culture that has granted the individual dominion over nature, so that the individual has the 
right to make the Great Mother subservient to the claims of man. This notion constitutes 
the central idea of complexly civilized patriarchal culture, and emerges into 
consciousness, against competing claims, with the greatest of difficulty: 

An American-Indian prophet, Smohalla, of the tribe of Umatilla, refused 
to till the soil. “It is a sin,” he said, “to wound or cut, to tear or scratch our 
common mother by working at agriculture.” And he added: “You ask me 
to dig in the earth? Am I to take a knife and plunge it into the breast of my 
mother? But then, when I die, she will not gather me again into her 
bosom. You tell me to dig up and take away the stones. Must I mutilate 



The Appearance of Anomaly 259 


her flesh so as to get at her bones? Then I can never again enter into her 
body and be born again. You ask me to cut the grass and the corn and sell 
them, to get rich like the white men. But how dare I crop the hair of my 
mother?” 397 

Every society shares a moral viewpoint, which is essentially an identity composed of 
unquestioned fidelity to a particular conception of “reality” ( what is and what should be), 
and of agreement upon the nature of those behaviors that may reasonably be manifested. 
All the individuals in a particular nation agree, fundamentally, about the nature of the 
unbearable present, the ideal future, and the means to transform one into the other. Every 
individual plays out that conceptualization, in terms of his or her own actions, more or 
less successfully: more successfully, or at least more easily, when nothing unintended 
arises to make the act of questioning necessary; less successfully when the moral action 
does not produce the proper consequence. Any assumption can be challenged. The most 
fundamental expectation of my fantasies—whatever they might be—is that my 
assumptions are valid. Mismatch between what I desired and what actually occurred 
constitutes evidences that one or more of my assumptions are invalid (but not necessarily 
information about which one, or at what level). The outcome of such a mismatch is 
application of other (assumption-predicated) patterns of action, and associated 
expectations, associated with gathering of new information, through active exploration. 
The further down the hierarchy of assumption that mismatch occurs, the more stressful 
the occurrence, the more fear is disinhibited, the more motivation for denial, the more 
necessity for exploration, the more necessary reprogramming of behavioral assumption 
and matching sensory expectation. 

A truly unexpected event sequence upsets the implicit assumptions upon which the 
original particular fantasy was predicated—and not only that fantasy, but innumerable 
presently implicit others, equally dependent for their existence upon those violated 
presuppositions. The inevitable consequence of such violation is the breakdown of 
expectation, and consequent generation of fear and hope, followed by exploration, the 
attempt to adapt to the new environment (to behave appropriately, to fulfill motivational 
demands imder new conditions, and to map new conditions). This consequence requires 
the paralysis of the old model, reversion of otherwise stably maintained affects to 
competition and chaos, and exploration-guided reconstruction of order. 

The more basic the level, the more that assumption is shared by virtually every 
conceivable fantasy. The more basic the level undermined, the more anxiety and 
depression [and other motivation—particularly (and non-evidently) hope] released from 
containment; the more behavioral adaptation cast into disrepute—the more motivation for 
denial, deceit, fascistic readaptation, degeneration and despair—the more wish for 
redemption. The undermining and reconstruction of more basic levels is, as we have seen, 
a revolutionary act, even in the scientific domain. The “normal” scientist works within 
the constraints of great models; the revolutionary changes the models. The normal 
scientist accepts the (current) game as valid, and tries to extend its relevant domain. The 
revolutionary scientist, who alters the rules of the game themselves, is playing a different 
game (with different and dangerous rules, from a within-the-game perspective). Kuhn 
states: 



Maps of meaning 260 


The transition from a paradigm in crisis to a new one from which a new 
tradition of normal science can emerge is far from a cumulative process, 
one achieved by an articulation or extension of the old paradigm. Rather it 
is a reconstruction of the field from new fundamentals, a reconstruction 
that changes some of the field’s most elementary theoretical 
generalizations as well as many of its paradigm methods and applications. 

During the transition period there will be a large but never complete 
overlap between the problems that can be solved by the old and the new 
paradigm. But there will also be a decisive difference in the modes of 
solution. When the transition is complete, the profession will have 
changed its view of the field, its methods, and its goals. 398 

The normal scientist is often antithetical to his more extreme (more creative/destructive) 
counterpart, like the good citizen opposes the heretic, in part because alteration of the 
rules changes the motivational significance of previously valued action and thought— 
often, apparently, reducing it to zero (which means that the revolutionary can completely 
destroy the significance of the career, past, present and future, of the dedicated plodder), 
in part, because restructuring of the rales temporarily returns everything to a state of 
anxiety-provoking chaos. Kuhn states: 

A paradigm is prerequisite to perception itself. What a man sees depends 
both upon what he looks at and also upon what his previous visual- 
conceptual experience has taught him to see. In the absence of such 
training there can only be, in William James’s phrase, “a bloomin’ buzzin’ 
confusion.” 399 

That “bloomin’ buzzin’ confusion”—the Great Dragon of Chaos—is not affectively 
neutral: in fact, its affective significance, threat and promise, is perhaps all that can be 
experienced of it before it has been categorized. 

Sometimes new information means mere lateral adjustment of behavior—the 
modification of approach, within a domain where still defined by the familiar goal. 
Sometimes, however, the unknown emerges in a manner that demands a qualitative 
adjustment in adaptive strategy: the revaluation of past, present and future, and 
acceptance of the suffering and confusion this necessarily entails. Kuhn comments on the 
effect (and affect) of emergent and persistent unknown in the domain of science. The 
pattern he describes characterized all cognitive revolutions, including those that take 
place in the universe of normal morality: 

When...an anomaly comes to seem more than just another puzzle of 
normal science, the transition to crisis and to extraordinary science has 
begun. The anomaly itself now comes to be more generally recognized as 
such by the profession. More and more attention is devoted to it by more 
and more of the field’s most eminent men. If it still continues to resist, as 
it usually does not, many of them may come to view its resolution as the 
subject matter of their discipline. For them the field will no longer look 
quite the same as it had earlier. Part of its different appearance results 



The Appearance of Anomaly 261 


simply from the new fixation point of scientific scrutiny. An even more 
important source of change is the divergent nature of the numerous partial 
solutions that concerted attention to the problem has made available. The 
early attacks upon the resistant problem will have followed the paradigm 
rules quite closely. But with continuing resistance, more and more of the 
attacks upon it will have involved some minor or not so minor articulation 
of the paradigm, no two of them quite alike, each partially successful, but 
none sufficiently so to be accepted as paradigm by the group. Through 
this proliferation of divergent articulations (more and more frequently 
they will come to be described as ad hoc adjustments), the rules of normal 
science become increasingly blurred. Though there still is a paradigm, few 
practitioners prove to be entirely agreed about what it is. Even formerly 
standard solutions of solved problems are called in question. 

When acute, this situation is sometimes recognized by the scientists 
involved. Copernicus complained that in his day astronomers were so 
“inconsistent in these [astronomical] investigations.. .that they cannot 
even explain or observe the constant length of the seasonal year. With 
them,” he continued, “it is as though an artist were to gather the hands, 
feet, head and other members for his images from diverse models, each 
part excellently drawn, but not related to a single body, and since they in 
no way match each other, the result would be monster rather than man.” 400 
Einstein, restricted by current usage to less florid language, wrote only, “It 
was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one, with no firm 
foundation to be seen anywhere, upon which one could have built.” 401 
And Wolfgang Pauli, in the months before Heisenberg’s paper on matrix 
mechanics pointed the way to a new quantum theory, wrote to a friend, 

“At the moment physics is again terribly confused. In any case, it is too 
difficult for me, and I wish I had been a movie comedian or something of 
the sort and had never heard of physics.” That testimony is particularly 
impressive if contrasted with Pauli’s words less than five months later: 
“Heisenberg’s type of mechanics has again given me hope and joy in life. 

To be sure it does not supply the solution to the riddle, but I believe it is 
again possible to march forward.” 402 403 

Now, Kuhn drew a qualitative distinction between the normal and revolutionary modes of 
operation. No such qualitative differences exist (although exemplars of the two types, 
drawn from the “extreme poles” of the process of knowledge-production, can be easily be 
brought to mind). The distinction is more along the lines of “transformation of what the 
group wants to transform” vs. “transformation of what the group would like to remain 
stable”—with the revolutionary changing more than might presently be desired (for the 
maintenance of the extant social hierarchy, for example). The “transformation of what the 
group wants to transform” is a form of bounded revolution, as we have discussed 
previously. Optimally bounded revolutions produce positive affect. Revolutions that 
upset the desired bounds—which are what Kuhn’s revolutionary scientist produces— 
evoke fear (and denial and aggression as defense mechanisms). The revolutionary 
produces involuntary alteration in the “articles of faith” of the normal individual. It is this 



Maps of meaning 262 


capacity that makes him revolutionary and necessary—and feared and despised. It may 
be more generally said that processes of “discovery” which upset large-scale space-time 
“maps” produce disruption of affect on an equivalent scale (and that it is such large-scale 
disruption that we entitle revolution). 

Mythologically structured social and individual “presumptions”—articles of faith— 
provide the environment in which a given culture-specific adaptive pattern retains its 
conditional validity. This pre-rational mythic environment is analogous in structure to the 
physical or natural environment itself—as the structure adapted to the environment 
rapidly becomes a constituent element of the environment itself, with the same essential 
characteristics. (Or, to say it somewhat differently, everything contained outside the wall 
defining “presently considered space” is “environment,” even though much of it is 
actually the consequence of historical or even individual activity). Disruption of the “pre- 
rational mythic ‘environment’” is just as catastrophic as disruption of the “physical or 
natural environment” (the two “disruptions” may not really be distinguishable, in the 
final analysis). This means essentially that to give serious consideration to another’s 
viewpoint means to risk exposure to indeterminate uncertainty—to risk a rise in 
existential anxiety, pain and depression; to experience temporally indeterminate affective, 
imagistic and cognitive chaos. It is much more likely, in consequence, that a foreign 
viewpoint will appear evil or will come to be defined as such (especially during times 
rendered unstable—unbearably novel—for additional alternative reasons). Once such 
definition occurs, application of aggression, designed to obliterate the source of threat, 
appears morally justified, even required by duty. The alternative or foreign viewpoint is 
in fact reasonably considered evil (although this consideration is dangerously one-sided), 
when viewed in terms of its potential destructive capacity, from within the strict confines 
of the historically determined social-psychological adaptive structure. It is only within the 
domain of meta-morality (which is the morality designed to update moral rules) that the 
strange may be tolerated or even welcomed. 

The group, in its external social and intrapsychic incarnations, is the current 
expression of a form of acting and thinking that has been given particular content over 
the course of thousands of years. These particular contents, patterns of behavior and their 
representations, were established initially by individuals who faced the unknown and 
prevailed, who were able to do or think something that no one had been able to do or 
think before. In this manner, heroic individuals create new assumptions and formulate 
new values. The integration of these assumptions and values into the group, through the 
competitive process that begins with imitation and ends with verbal abstraction, increases 
the permanent behavioral and abstract logical repertoire of the individuals that form that 
group. The sum total of such behavioral patterns (and second- and third-order 
descriptions thereof), shared within a social group, constitutes that group. Groups are 
predicated upon a collective, historically determined structure of (abstractly represented) 
behavioral patterns (and consequences thereof), which tends toward internal consistency 
and stability over time. Internalization of this behavioral pattern and representations 
thereof protects the individuals who compose the group against fear of their own 
experience. The group is the culturally determined hierarchical structure of behavior— 
and abstracted conceptualization thereof—which inhibits fear of novelty, the Terrible 
Mother, source of all nightmares. The group is the historical structure that humanity has 
erected between the individual and the unknown. The group, in its beneficial guise, 



The Appearance of Anomaly 263 


serves to protect the individuals who compose it from threat and the unknown. The social 
establishment of how to behave, when presented with a given situation, inhibits the 
paralyzing fear that situation would otherwise instinctively induce. 

The group is also simultaneously the concrete historical expression of Homo sapiens ’ 
unique heroic “thesis,” as stated previously: that the nature of experience can he altered, 
for the better, by voluntary alteration of action and thought. This central thesis is 
expressed in the myth of the way. Loss of (previously extant) paradise initiates the 
“redemptive” activity, history; restoration of paradise—in the course or as a consequence 
of proper behavior—is its goal. This general pattern appears characteristic of all 
civilizations, every philosophy, every ideology, all religions. The general idea that 
change may bring improvement—upon which all voluntary change is predicated—is in 
itself based in the ideal upon the assumption [on the (necessary) fiction] that through 
historical process perfection might be attained. This myth—even in its earliest ritual 
incarnation—therefore provides the basis for the idea of progress itself. The group, 
history incarnate, is the embodiment of a specific mode of being designed to attain 
perfection, and contains the concrete expression of the goal of a people; it is the objective 
and subjective realization of the mode by which they improve their tragic condition. 
History not only protects people from the unknown; it provides them with rules for 
achieving what they desire most, and, therefore, for expressing the (essentially 
undeclarable) meaning of their lives. 

Human moral knowledge progresses as procedural knowledge expands its domain, as 
episodic memory encodes, ever more accurately, the patterns that characterize that 
knowledge; as the semantic system comes to explicitly represent the implicit principles 
upon which procedural knowledge and episodic representation of that knowledge rest— 
and, of course, as the consequences of this second- and third-order representation alter 
the nature of procedure itself. Thus the democratic political theorist, for example, can 
finally put into words the essence of religious myth after the myth had captured in image 
the essence of adaptive behavior; can talk about “intrinsic right” as if that notion were 
something rational. This process of increasing abstraction and representation is 
equivalent to development of “higher” consciousness (especially if the ever-more 
enlightened words are in fact—utopian wish—transformed back down the hierarchy to 
the level of action). 

The major advantage of increased abstraction of representation, apart from ease of 
communication, is increased adaptive flexibility: alterations in abstract thought can 
proceed “as if’ a game, without immediate practical consequences, positive or 
negative. 404 The disadvantage of this adaptive flexibility is the emergence of ability to 
constantly (and inappropriately, in most cases) undermine the a priori presumptions of 
the game: to call the rules into question; to dissolve impetus for action and to disinhibit 
existential anxiety. A game is fun until the rules appear childish. Then the fun disappears. 
This might be progress, in time. Until a new game appears, however, it is merely 
troublesome. The process of abstract (semantic) inquiry is capable of undermining moral 
adaptation at each level—semantic, episodic and procedural—simultaneously. This 
possibility might be regarded, once again, as a (destructive/beneficial) side effect of the 
ability to abstract. 

The evolutionary construction of an adaptive social structure, simultaneously extant in 
behavior and in semantic/episodic representation of that behavior, means abstraction and 



Maps of meaning 264 


hierarchical organization of knowledge hard won in the physical battle for survival, and 
consequent capacity for immediate communication of that knowledge, in the absence of 
direct demonstration. Furthermore, it means potential for alteration and experimentation 
in the abstract (in play, episodic and semantic), prior to application in the real world. 
Acquisition of such ability—the capacity for abstract creative thought, and social 
exchange thereof—means tremendous heightening of adaptive ability, as concepts 
constructed purely semantically attain the capacity for alteration of episodic 
representation and procedure itself. Once the nature of morality is coded semantically, so 
that the implicit hierarchically structured presuppositions of behavior have been rendered 
explicit, they can be considered, debated and altered in their essential nature. Such 
alteration is capable of resonating down the cognitive chain to procedure itself. Likewise, 
alterations in procedure are (and should be) capable of producing profound effects upon 
episodic and semantic representation. This increased flexibility, the result of a 
tremendously complex and lengthy historical development, is tremendously useful for the 
purposes of rapid adaptation and change, but also equally promotes conflict, social and 
intrapsychic. Such conflict emerges as a consequence of destabilization of historical 
tradition. 

It is the essential flexibility of the human brain, its very capacity to learn, and 
therefore to unlearn, that renders Homo sapiens so appallingly susceptible to group and 
intrapsychic conflict. An animal’s behavioral pattern, its procedural knowledge, is set; its 
way of being in the unknown cannot easily be altered in its fundament. The assumptions 
and values by which an individual human being lives can, by contrast, be threatened with 
a few well-chosen and revolutionary words, whose ease of communication belies their 
elaborately complex evolutionary history, the depth of heroic endeavor necessary to their 
formulation and their extreme current potency. Sufficiently novel verbally transmitted 
information may disturb semantic, episodic and procedural paradigm simultaneously, 
although the totality of such effects may not become manifest for years—not 
infrequently, for generations. 

Every culture maintains certain key beliefs that are centrally important to that culture, 
upon which all secondary beliefs are predicated. These key beliefs cannot be easily given 
up, because if they are, everything falls, and the unknown once again rules. Western 
morality and behavior, for example, are predicated on the assumption that every 
individual is sacred. This belief was already extant in its nascent form among the ancient 
Egyptians, and provides the very cornerstone of Judeo-Christian civilization. Successful 
challenge to this idea would invalidate the actions and goals of the Western individual; 
would destroy the Western dominance hierarchy, the social context for individual action. 
In the absence of this central assumption, the body of Western law—formalized myth, 
codified morality—erodes and falls. There are no individual rights, no individual value— 
and the foundation of the Western social (and psychological) structure dissolves. The 
Second World War and Cold War were fought largely to eliminate such a challenge. 

For the man whose beliefs have become abstracted (and, therefore, more doubtful, 
more debatable), the mere idea of the stranger is sufficient to disrupt the stability of 
everyday presumption. Tolstoy, in his Confessions, recalls the impact of modern Western 
European ideas on the too-long-static medieval culture of Russia: 



The Appearance of Anomaly 265 


I remember that when I was eleven years old a high-school boy named 
Volodin’ka M., now long since dead, visited us one Sunday with an 
announcement of the latest discovery made at school. The discovery was 
that there is no God and that the things they were teaching us were 
nothing but fairy tales (this was in 1838). I remember how this news 
captured the interest of my older brothers; they even let me in on their 
discussions. I remember that we were all very excited and that we took 
this news to be both engaging and entirely possible. 405 

This “discovery,” which was in fact the cumulative result of a very lengthy and traumatic 

Western European cognitive process, had the capacity to undermine the most 

fundamental presuppositions of Russian culture (as it had undermined those of the West): 

Since ancient times, when the life of which I do know something began, 
people who knew the arguments concerning the vanity of life, the 
arguments that revealed to me its meaninglessness, lived nonetheless, 
bringing to life a meaning of their own. Since the time when people 
somehow began to live, this meaning of life has been with them, and they 
have led this life up to my own time. Everything that is in me and around 
me is the fruit of their knowledge of life. The very tools of thought by 
which I judge life and condemn it were created not by me but by them. I 
myself was born, educated and have grown up thanks to them. They dug 
out the iron, taught us how to cut the timber, tamed the cattle and the 
horses, showed us how to sow crops and live together; they brought order 
to our lives. They taught me how to think and to speak. I am their 
offspring, nursed by them, reared by them, taught by them; I think 
according to their thoughts, their words, and now I have proved to them 
that it is all meaningless! 406 

This rational undermining eventually, inevitably, produced the following effects: 

It happened with me as it happens with everyone who contracts a fatal 
internal disease. At first there were the insignificant symptoms of an 
ailment, which the patient ignores; then these symptoms recur more and 
more frequently, until they merge into one continuous duration of 
suffering. The suffering increases, and before he can turn around the 
patient discovers what he already knew: the thing he had taken for a mere 
indisposition is in fact the most important thing on earth to him, is in fact 
death. 

This is exactly what happened to me. I realized that this was not an 
incidental ailment but something very serious, and that if the same 
questions should continue to recur, I would have to answer them. And I 
tried to answer them. The questions seemed to be such foolish, simple, 
childish questions. But as soon as I laid my hands on them and tried to 
resolve them, I was immediately convinced, first of all, that they were not 
childish and foolish questions but the most vital and profound questions in 



Maps of meaning 266 


life, and, secondly, that no matter how much I pondered them there was 
no way I could resolve them. Before I could be occupied with my Samsara 
estate, with the education of my son, or with the writing of books, I had to 
know why I was doing these things. As long as I do not know the reason 
why, I cannot do anything. In the middle of my concern with the 
household, which at the time kept me quite busy, a question would 
suddenly come into my head: “Very well, you will have 6000 desyatins in 
the Samara province, as well as 300 horses; what then?” And I was 
completely taken aback and did not know what else to think. As soon as I 
started to think about the education of my children, I would ask myself, 
“Why?” Or I would reflect on how the people might attain prosperity, and 
I would suddenly ask myself, “What concern is it of mine?” Or in the 
middle of thinking about the fame that my works were bringing me I 
would say to myself, “Very well, you will be more famous than Gogol, 
Pushkin, Shakespeare, Moliere, more famous than all the writers in the 
world—so what?” 

And I could find absolutely no reply. 

My life came to a stop. I could breathe, eat, drink, and sleep; indeed, I 
could not help but breathe, eat, drink, and sleep. But there was no life in 
me because I had no desires whose satisfaction I would have found 
reasonable. If I wanted something, I knew beforehand that it did not 
matter whether or not I got it. 

If a fairy had come and offered to fulfill my every wish, I would not 
have known what to wish for. If in moments of intoxication I should have 
not desires but the habits of old desires, in moments of sobriety I knew 
that it was all a delusion, that I really desired nothing. I did not even want 
to discover truth anymore because I had guessed what it was. The truth 
was that life is meaningless. 

It was as though I had lived a little, wandered a little, until I came to 
the precipice, and I clearly saw that there was nothing ahead except ruin. 
And there was no stopping, no turning back, no closing my eyes so I 
would not see that there was nothing ahead except the deception of life 
and of happiness and the reality of suffering and death, of complete 
annihilation. 

I grew sick of life; some irresistible force was leading me to somehow 
get rid of it. It was not that I wanted to kill myself. The force that was 
leading me away from life was more powerful, more absolute, more all- 
encompassing than any desire. With all my strength I straggled to get 
away from life. The thought of suicide came to me as naturally then as the 
thought of improving life had come to me before. This thought was such a 
temptation that I had to use cunning against myself in order not to go 
through with it too hastily. I did not want to be in a hurry only because I 
wanted to use all my strength to untangle my thoughts. If I could not get 
them untangled, I told myself, I could always go ahead with it. And there I 
was, a fortunate man, carrying a rope from my room where I was alone 
every night as I undressed, so that I would not hang myself from the beam 



The Appearance of Anomaly 267 


between the closets. And I quit going hunting with a gun, so that I would 
not be too easily tempted to rid myself of life. I myself did not know what 
I wanted. I was afraid of life, I struggled to get rid of it, and yet I hoped 
for something from it. 

And this was happening to me at a time when, from all indications, I 
should have been considered a completely happy man; this was when I 
was not yet fifty years old. I had a good, loving, and beloved wife, fine 
children, and a large estate that was growing and expanding without any 
effort on my part. More than ever before I was respected by friends and 
acquaintances, praised by strangers, and I could claim a certain renown 
without really deluding myself. Moreover, I was not physically and 
mentally unhealthy; on the contrary, I enjoyed a physical and mental vigor 
such as I had rarely encountered among others my age. Physically, I could 
keep up with the peasants working in the fields; mentally, I could work 
eight and ten hours at a stretch without suffering any aftereffects from the 
strain. And in such a state of affairs I came to a point where I could not 
live; and even though I feared death, I had to employ ruses against myself 
to keep from committing suicide. 

I described my spiritual condition to myself in this way: my life is 
some kind of stupid and evil practical joke that someone is playing on me. 

In spite of the fact that I did not acknowledge the existence of any 
“Someone” who might have created me, the notion that someone brought 
me into the world as a stupid and evil joke seemed to be the most natural 
way to describe my condition. 407 

Group identity—inculcated morality and accepted interpretation—serves to constrain the 
motivational significance of experiential phenomena. When that identity (which is 
predicated upon implicit or explicitly held faith in a particular conceptualization of the 
way) is challenged, such constraints vanish. This “deconstruction” of symbolically 
patriarchal custom and belief subjects the individual to intrapsychic war of conflicting 
affect—the “clash of opposites,” in Jungian terms; it subjugates him or her to unbearable 
cognitive, emotional and moral conflict. Nietzsche’s comments on Hamlet, “sickbed o’er 
by the pale cast of thought,” are relevant in this context: 

Knowledge kills action; action requires the veils of illusion: that is the 
doctrine of Hamlet.... Now no comfort avails any more; longing 
transcends a world after death, even the gods; existence is negated along 
with its glittering reflection in the gods or in an immortal beyond. 
Conscious of the truth he has once seen, man now sees everywhere only 
the horror or absurdity of existence; now he understands what is symbolic 
in Ophelia’s fate; now he understands the wisdom of the sylvan god, 

Silenus: he is nauseated. 408 409 

Dostoevsky’s tragically comic bureaucratic-personality-disordered protagonist (the 
metaphoric mouse) in Notes from Underground reacts similarly, comparing his own 
(sophisticated) inability to respond courageously to an insult to that of 1 ’homme de la 



Maps of meaning 268 


nature et de la verite —the natural, and therefore truthful, yet comparatively unconscious 
(procedural) man: 

Let us now look at the mouse in action. Suppose, for example, that it too 
has been insulted (and it will almost always be subjected to slights) and 
desires revenge. Perhaps even more firry will accumulate inside it than 
inside I’homme de la nature et de la verite because I’homme de la nature 
et de la verite, with his innate stupidity, considers his revenge to be no 
more than justice, while the mouse, with its heightened consciousness, 
denies that there is any justice about it. At last comes the act itself, the 
revenge. The wretched mouse has by this time accumulated, in addition to 
the original nastiness, so many other nastinesses in the shape of questions 
and doubts, and so many other unresolved problems in addition to the 
original problem, that it has involuntarily collected round itself a fatal 
morass, a stinking bog, consisting of its own doubts and agitations, and 
finally of the spittle rained on it by all the spontaneous men of action 
standing portentously round as judges and referees, and howling with 
laughter. Of course, nothing remains for it to do but shrug the whole thing 
off and creep shamefacedly into its hole with a smile of pretended 
contempt in which it doesn’t even believe itself. 410 

The fictional characters of Shakespeare and Dostoevsky respond like the flesh-and-blood 
Tolstoy to the same historically determined set of circumstances—to the “death of god,” 
in Nietzsche’s terminology, brought about, inexorably, by continued development of 
abstract consciousness. The “first modern man,” Hamlet, and those who follow him, in 
art and in life, characteristically respond like Nietzsche’s “pale criminal”; like Crime and 
Punishment’s Raskolnikov, they remain unable to bear the “terrible beauty” 411 of their 
deeds. Nietzsche states: 

Of what is great one must either be silent or speak with greatness. With 
greatness—that means cynically and with innocence. What I relate is the 
history of the next two centuries. I describe what is coming, what can no 
longer come differently: the advent of nihilism.... Our whole European 
culture is moving for some time now, with a tortured tension that is 
growing from decade to decade, as toward a catastrophe: restlessly, 
violently, headlong, like a river that wants to reach the end, that no longer 
reflects, that is afraid to reflect. 

He that speaks here has, conversely, done nothing so far but to reflect: 
as a philosopher and solitary by instinct who has found his advantage in 
standing aside, outside. Why has the advent of nihilism become 
necessary? Because the values we have had hitherto thus draw their final 
consequence; because nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion 
of our great values and ideals—because we must experience nihilism 
before we can find out what value these “values” really had. 

We require, at some time, new values. 



The Appearance of Anomaly 269 


Nihilism stands at the door: whence comes this uncanniest of all 
guests? 

Point of departure: it is an error to consider “social distress” or 
“physiological degeneration,” or corruption of all things, as the cause of 
nihilism. Ours is the most honest and compassionate age. Distress, 
whether psychic, physical, or intellectual, need not at all produce nihilism 
(that is, the radical rejection of value, meaning, and desirability). Such 
distress always permits a variety of interpretations. Rather: it is in one 
particular interpretation, the Christian moral one, that nihilism is rooted. 

The end of Christianity—at the hands of its own morality (which 
cannot be replaced), which turns against the Christian God: the sense of 
truthfulness, highly developed by Christianity, is nauseated by the 
falseness and mendaciousness of all Christian interpretations of the world 
and of history; rebound from “God is the truth” to the fanatical faith “All 
is false”; an active Buddhism. 

Skepticism regarding morality is what is decisive. The end of the moral 
interpretation of the world, which no longer has any sanction after it has 
tried to escape into some beyond, leads to nihilism. 

“All lacks meaning.” (The untenability of one interpretation of the 
world, upon which a tremendous amount of energy has been lavished, 
awakens the suspicion that all interpretations of the world are false.) 412 

That, in a nutshell, is “cascade.” 

Nihilism, alter ego of totalitarianism, is response to experience of the world, self and 
other, rendered devoid of certain meaning, and therefore allowed no meaning; is reaction 
to the world freed from the unconscious constraints of habit, custom and belief; is 
response to the re-emergence of the terrible unknown; is reaction of a spirit no longer 
able, as a consequence of abstract critical ability, to manifest unconscious or procedural 
identity with the hero—no longer able to muster belief in human possibility, in the face of 
exposure to the most dreadful imaginable. Phenomena remain constrained in their 
affective significance, at least partially, because the group (the dominance hierarchy) has 
reached agreement as to their meaning (their implications for situation-specific action). 
When that hierarchy falls—perhaps as a consequence of emergent disbelief in central 
presumption—nothing remains “sacred.” This process becomes evidently manifest, from 
the empirical viewpoint, during a riot. When law and order are held temporarily in 
abeyance [when the inhibitory force of imposed threat is relieved (when the dominance 
hierarchy momentarily collapses)], those whose moral behavior remains predicated upon 
resentful obedience fall prey to their own disordered affect, and explode in aggression, 
greed, hatred and vengeful destructiveness. This explosion [implosion (?)] is “reduction 
to the precosmogonic continuum,” from the pre-experimental or mythic viewpoint 413 — 
regression to the time and place prior to the division of things into known and unknown. 
This can be viewed either as alteration in affect, or transformation of the motivational 
significance of the phenomena whose apprehension motivates behavior. The objective 
mind would postulate the former; the mythic mind, concerned with subjective reality, the 
latter. This form of regression exists as precondition to creative restructuring. Semi¬ 
conscious (semi-declarative) apprehension of this affect-laden state manifest as

paralyzing fear, exists (fortunately and catastrophically) as the greatest impediment to 
change. 

The dominance hierarchy of value, extant socially and intrapsychically, employs fear 
(and promise) to regulate access to desired commodities—to determine the net 
motivational significance of particular events and processes. Any given phenomenon is 
capable of inducing a variety of affective or motivational states. It is the socially and 
individually determined outcome of competition between these intrapsychic states that 
determines behavioral output. The internalized consequence of the external dominance 
hierarchy—which is the “intrapsychic patriarchy,” Freud’s superego—is knowledge of 
the net motivational relevance of phenomena within a particular society. This implies, as 
stated previously, that the historically determined power structure of a given society 
could be inferred through analysis of the significance granted technological and cognitive 
artifacts by the individuals within that society. What is desired depends upon the goal 
toward which a given society moves. The goal is posited as valuable, initially, as a 
consequence of the operation of unconscious “presumptions,” hypothetically preceding 
action. The value presupposed by the action is then coded episodically, then, perhaps, 
formalized semantically. Someone from a different culture values things differently; this 
difference is predicated upon acceptance of an alternate goal-directed schema. The nature 
and presence of this difference may be inferred (will, in fact, necessarily be inferred) 
from observation of foreign behavior, imagination and discussion—even inferred, 
perhaps, from exposure to cultural artifacts (which are generally granted the status of 
“mere” tools, which is to say, implements of the way) or from cues as subtle as voice or 
procedural melody. 414 

Movement from one schema to another—or from both to a hypothetical third, which 
unites both (which might constitute the consequence of revolutionary heroic effort)— 
presupposes dissolution, mutual or singular, not mere addition (a “qualitative” shift, not a 
“quantitative” shift). Mythically, as we have seen, this movement might be represented as 
descent from the precipice into the abyss, as the collapse of the idol with feet of clay, as 
dissolution to constituent bodily or material elements, as journey to the underworld or sea 
bottom, as sojourn through the valley of the shadow of death, as forty years (or forty 
days) in the desert, as encounter with the hydra, as incest with the mother. When such a 
journey is undertaken voluntarily—resources prepared adequately beforehand, faith in 
place—chance of success (return, reconstitution, resurrection, ascent) is substantially 
enhanced. When dissolution occurs accidentally—when encounter with the unknown is 
unintentional 4 " or avoided beyond its time of inevitable occurrence—intrapsychic or 
social catastrophe, suicide or war, becomes certain. 

The goal toward which behavior is devoted serves as one pole of the cognitive schema 
that determines the motivational significance of events. Members of the same culture 
share the same goal. This goal consists of a hypothetical desired state that exists in 
contrast to some conceptualization of the present and that can be attained through 
participation in a particular consensually accepted and traditionally determined process. 
This schema is analogous in structure to the normal mythological conception of the way, 
which includes a representation of the (troubled) present, a conception of the (desired) 
future, and a description of methods (moral prescriptions and injunctions) for 
transforming the former into the latter. Moral knowledge serves to further the way by 
reducing the infinite potential motivational significance of particular events to the 



The Appearance of Anomaly 271 


particular and determinate. This process of reduction is social in nature—events take on 
established meaning that is socially determined, shared. The affective relevance of a 
given phenomenon—which, most fundamentally, is its significance for goal-directed 
behavior—is a consequence of the operation of the goal-oriented schema, which finds 
partial expression in establishment of a dominance hierarchy. A dominance hierarchy is a 
social arrangement which determines access to desired commodities. In most cases, these 
commodities are cues for consummatory reward—experiences that signify movement 
toward or increased likelihood of attaining the desired goal. Relative position in the 
dominance hierarchy—at least in the perfectly functioning society—is in itself 
determined through social judgment. That judgment reflects appreciation of the value of a 
particular individual. That value reflects how society views the ability of that individual 
to contribute to attainment of the goal. This interpretation of course implies that the 
postulation of a given way necessarily, inevitably, produces a hierarchy of value (since 
people and things will inevitably differ in their utility as means to the desired end). Every 
phenomenon, experienced within the confines of a particular society, is laden with 
dominance-hierarchy and goal-schema relevant information. The value of any particular 
item or experience is determined by the mythic foundation—upon which the entire 
society, consciously and unconsciously, rests. This value is the magic of the object. 

Schismatic activity, semantic, episodic, or procedural, might be considered the within- 
group equivalent to arrival of an (abstracted or concrete) stranger. Cultural schisms 
emerge when once-predictable and familiar individuals become possessed by novel 
behavioral notions, images or semantic formulations, which present a challenge to 
presumptions deemed necessarily inviolable—such as the (most dangerous, authoritarian) 
presumption that all currently accepted presumptions are “true.” Medieval horror of 
heresy and the drastic responses to such ideation defined as necessary by the Catholic 
guardians of proper thought is rendered comprehensible as a consequence of 
consideration (1) of the protective function of intact dogma and (2) of the methodological 
impossibility of “disproving,” so to speak, alternative mythically founded narrative ideas. 
The Christian church fragmented chaotically (and, perhaps, creatively)—and continues to 
do so—with horrendous consequences, even under conditions where such fragmentation 
was severely punished. This is not stated to provide justification for repression of 
creativity, but to make the motivation for such repression understandable. Degeneration 
into chaos—decadence—might be considered the constant threat of innovation 
undertaken in the absence of comprehension and respect for tradition. Such decadence is 
precisely as dangerous to the stability and adaptability of the community and the 
individual and as purely motivated by underground wishes and desires as is 
totalitarianism or desire for absolute order. The continuing absence of a generally 
accepted methodology for peaceably sorting out the relative value or validity of evident 
mythologically predicated differences helps ensure that savage repression will remain the 
frequently utilized alternative. 

Rapid development of semantic skill (and its second-order elaboration into empirical 
methodology) constitutes the third major threat to the continued stability of 
sociohistorically determined adaptive cultural systems (as well as the major factor in the 
complex elaboration of such systems). (The first two—just a reminder—were rapid 
natural environmental shift, independent of human activity, and contact with a heretofore 
isolated foreign culture). Literate individuals, members of cultures contained in express 



Maps of meaning 272 


theologies or rational philosophies, can more easily incarnate and/or abstractly adopt or 
provisionally formulate different positions, with regard to the value of initial 
assumptions; can also verbalize the beliefs of other people, absorb them, and subject 
them to critical consideration or (theoretically) guileless acceptance; are fated necessarily 
to be able to become many other people, in imitation, imagination, and thought. 
Linguistically mediated criticism of the predicates of behavior undermines faith in the 
validity of historically established hierarchical patterns of adaptation. The final emergent 
process of the developmental chain of abstraction can be applied to undermine the 
stability of its foundation. The modern and verbally sophisticated individual is therefore 
always in danger of sawing off the branch on which he or she sits. 

Language turned drama into mythic narrative, narrative into formal religion, and 
religion into critical philosophy, providing exponential expansion of adaptive ability— 
while simultaneously undermining assumption and expectation, and dividing knowledge 
from action. Civilized Homo sapiens can use words to destroy what words did not create. 
This ability has left modern individuals increasingly subject to their worst fears. 
Nietzsche states: 

Our Europe of today, being the arena of an absurdly sudden attempt at a 
radical mixture of classes, and hence races, is therefore skeptical in all its 
heights and depths—sometimes with that mobile skepticism which leaps 
impatiently and lasciviously from branch to branch, sometimes dismal 
like a cloud overcharged with question marks—and often mortally sick of 
its will. Paralysis of the will: where today does one not find this cripple 
sitting? And often in such finery! How seductive the finery looks! This 
disease enjoys the most beautiful pomp-and-lie costumes; and most of 
what today displays itself in the showcases, for example, as “objectivity,” 

“being scientific,” “1 ’art pour l ’art, ” “pure knowledge, free of will,” is 
merely dressed-up skepticism and paralysis of the will: for this diagnosis 
of the European sickness I vouch. 416 

The intellectual developments which lead to the establishment of modern scientific 
methodology have heightened the danger of this partially pathological tendency. The 
construction of a powerful and accurate representation of the “objective” or shared 
world—a logical conclusion of the interpersonal exchange of sensory information, made 
possible by linguistic communication—challenged belief in the reality of the mythic 
world, which was in fact never objective. The mythic world was always affective— 
although it was shared socially—and contained procedural information (and abstracted 
representation thereof), arranged hierarchically in terms of value, embodied in nonverbal 
procedural and abstracted imagistic and semantic form. Representation of mythic value in 
verbal format allowed for simple experimentation in ethics, in imagination (and then, 
often tragically, in action), and for generation of naive but effective criticism regarding 
traditional foundations for behavior. Nietzsche states: 

For this is the way in which religions are wont to die out: under the stern, 
intelligent eyes of an orthodox dogmatism, the mythical premises of a 
religion are systematized as a sum total of historical events; one begins 



The Appearance of Anomaly 273 


apprehensively to defend the credibility of the myths, while at the same 
time one opposes any continuation of their natural vitality and growth; the 
feeling for myth perishes, and its place is taken by the claim of religion to 
historical foundations. 417 

Freud maintained, as an ideal nineteenth-century empiricist, that “there is no other source 
of knowledge of the universe but the intellectual manipulation of carefully verified 
observations—that is, what is called research—and that no knowledge can be obtained 
from revelation, intuition or inspiration.” Fie said, furthermore, that “there is no appeal 
beyond reason” 418 (grounded directly in “observation,” one would presume). This 
description leaves no place for the primal role of affect (or even of sensation, for that 
matter) in determination of wisdom—“what causes me and others pain is wrong,” in the 
most basic and naive form—and also fails to address the issue of the source of scientific 
hypotheses in general (the narrative process). Furthermore, pure knowledge of the 
sensory world—what is, most fundamentally—does not include knowledge about how to 
adapt to or behave in that world (even though the gathering of such information has 
obvious implications for such adaptation). Tolstoy states: 

As presented by the learned and the wise, rational knowledge denies the 
meaning of life, but the huge masses of people acknowledge meaning 
through an irrational knowledge. And this irrational knowledge is faith, 
the one thing that I could not accept. This involves the God who is both 
one and three, the creation in six days, devils, angels and everything else 
that I could not accept without taking leave of my senses. 

My position was terrible. I knew that I could find nothing in the way of 
rational knowledge except a denial of life; and in faith I could find 
nothing except a denial of reason, and this was even more impossible than 
a denial of life. According to rational knowledge, it followed that life is 
evil, and people know it. They do not have to live, yet they have lived and 
they do live, just as I myself had lived, even though I had known for a 
long time that life is meaningless and evil. According to faith, it followed 
that in order to understand the meaning of life I would have to turn away 
from reason, the very thing for which meaning was necessary. 419 

Mythic thinking, so to speak, is also based on observation—but on observation of 
behavior in the world of affective experience. This means cyclical observation of action 
predicated upon an implicit or explicitly formulated theory of what should be, and 
derivation of procedural, episodic or semantic representations thereof. This is knowledge, 
as well—and appears, in the light of careful analysis, no more arbitrary than empirical 
description of the objective world. 

Perhaps it was necessary for science, struggling to escape from a cognitive world 
dominated by religious and mythical thinking, to devalue that world in order to set up an 
independent existence. That existence has long been established, however—but the 
process of devaluation, implicit and explicit, continues (even in fields theoretically 
separate from the strictly empirical). Frye states: 



Maps of meaning 274 


Ever since Plato, most literary critics have connected the word “thought” 
with dialectical and conceptual idioms, and ignored or denied the 
existence of poetic and imaginative thought. This attitude continued into 
the twentieth century with I.A.Richards’s Science and Poetry, with its 
suggestion that mythical thinking has been superseded by scientific 
thinking, and that consequently poets must confine themselves to pseudo¬ 
statements. The early criticism of T.S.Eliot, though considerably more 
cautious than this, also exhibited an array of contusions clustering around 
the word “thought.” Since then there has been a slowly growing 
realization that mythological thinking cannot be superseded, because it 
forms the framework and context for all thinking. But the old views still 
persist, if in more sophisticated forms, and there are still far too many 
literary critics who are both ignorant and contemptuous of the mental 
processes that produce literature. 420 

Nietzsche states, similarly, but with somewhat more scorn: 

Every age has its own divine type of naivety for whose invention other 
ages may envy it—and how much naivety, venerable, childlike and 
boundlessly clumsy naivety lies in the scholar’s faith in his superiority, in 
the good conscience of his tolerance, in the unsuspecting simple certainly 
with which his instinct treats the religious man as an inferior and lower 
type that he has outgrown, leaving it behind, beneath him—him, that 
presumptuous little dwarf and rabble man, the assiduous and speedy head- 
and handiworker of “ideas,” of “modern ideas!” 421 

Mythological thinking is not mere arbitrary superstition. Its denigration—cascading even 
through literary criticism, in recent years—is not only unwarranted but perilous. This is 
not to say that religious institutions and dogmas are not prey to the same weaknesses as 
all other human creations. The ideas and patterns of action that underlay and generated 
those institu-tions remain of critical importance, however—remain important for 
sustaining individual emotional stability, maintaining group tolerance, cohesion and 
flexibility, supporting capacity to adapt to the strange, and strengthening ability to resist 
domination by one-sided and murderous ideologies. The idea that we have superseded 
such thinking is a prime example of the capacity of the “semantic system” to partially 
represent and to thoroughly criticize. This is wrong, arrogant and dangerous. 

The group promotes an integrated pattern of behavior and conception of values. This 
is strength, in that an integrated pattern provides one message, and therefore promotes 
unity and direction. It is also weakness, in that integration—stable, hierarchically 
organized structure—is inflexible, and therefore brittle. This means the group, and those 
who identify with it, cannot easily develop new modes of perception or change direction 
when such change or development becomes necessary. Under stable environmental and 
social conditions, this is an advantage, as what worked in the past will continue to work 
in the present. However, in times of transition, of rapid environmental transformation, of 
multicultural contact, of technological or ideological advance, stability is not necessarily 
sufficient. The Russian neuropsychologist Sokolov stated, as cited previously, 422 “One 



The Appearance of Anomaly 275 


way to improve the quality of extrapolation [judgment of match between intent and 
outcome] is to secure additional information; another method is to change the principles 
by which such information is handled, so that the process of regulation will prove more 
effective.” This fundamental idea is embodied in mythology in the figure of the 
revolutionary hero. He is the fourth manner in which threat to the stability of cultural 
tradition may be presented and, simultaneously, is solution to the ever-recurring problem 
of such threat. 


The Revolutionary Hero 

The revolutionary hero reorders the protective structure of society, when the emergence 
of an anomaly makes such reordering necessary. He is therefore the agent of change, 
upon whose actions all stability is predicated. This capacity—which should make him a 
welcome figure in every community—is exceedingly threatening to those completely 
encapsulated by the status quo, and who are unable or unwilling to see where the present 
state of adaptation is incomplete and where residual danger lies. The archetypal 
revolutionary hero therefore faces the anger and rejection of his peers, as well as the 
terrors of the absolutely unknown. He is nonetheless the “best friend” of the state. 

Analysis of the archaic ecstatic practice of shamanism —prevalent throughout “the 
immense area comprising Central and North Asia” 4 " '—sheds further light on the nature 
of the actions and typical experiences of the revolutionary hero. Europeans who made 
initial contact with these tribal healers frequently deemed them insane. The reverse was 
in fact true: the genuine shaman was the most sane man of the tribe (that is, the man 
whose extent of adaptation was greatest). Furthermore, he served as primordial “unified 
ancestor” of the lately differentiated or specialized creative agent: explorer, mystic, artist, 
scientist and physician. The Asian shaman was master of religious life, embodiment and 
keeper of the sacred doctrine, dominant authority and creator of culture. 

The widespread practices and viewpoints of shamanism constitute a cohesive 
philosophy, so to speak, embedded “unconsciously” in behavior and image. This ritual 
philosophy comprises a set of observations about the nature of radical personality 
transformation, and a set of practices designed to bring such alteration about. Shamanism 
is devoted to furtherance of the possibility of qualitative improvements in 
“consciousness” or general adaptive ability; it has captured the essence of such possibility 
in image, to minimize the accompanying terror. Shamanism is prototypical of those 
religious practices designed to modify human behavior and interpretation—to induce and 
regulate the processes of spiritual reconfiguration. These practices are not merely cultural 
in nature. They originate in the observation of spontaneous psychological transmutation, 
a psychobiologically grounded human capacity. Shamanic rituals are therefore not merely 
anachronistic, without modern relevance, except as curiosity dictates—but prime 
exemplars of a process we must come to understand. 

The shaman is not simply an archaic figure, an interesting anomaly from the dead 
past—he is the embodiment, in cultures we do not comprehend, of those people we 
admire most in the past. The phenomenon of the “creative illness,” described in detail by 
Henri Ellenberger, in his massive study of the history of the unconscious, is alive and 
well in our own culture. Ellenberger described its characteristic elements: 



Maps of meaning 276 


A creative illness succeeds a period of intense preoccupation with an idea 
and search for a certain truth. It is a polymorphous condition that can take 
the shape of depression, neurosis, psychosomatic ailments, or even 
psychosis. Whatever the symptoms, they are felt as painful, if not 
agonizing, by the subject, with alternating periods of alleviation and 
worsening. Throughout the illness the subject never loses the thread of his 
dominating preoccupation. It is often compatible with normal, 
professional activity and family life. But even if he keeps to his social 
activities, he is almost entirely absorbed with himself. He suffers from 
feelings of utter isolation, even when he has a mentor who guides him 
through the ordeal (like the shaman apprentice with his master). The 
termination is often rapid and marked by a phase of exhilaration. The 
subject emerges from his ordeal with a permanent transformation in his 
personality and the conviction that he has discovered a great truth or a 
new spiritual world. 424 

Many of the nineteenth- and twentieth-century figures recognized unquestionably as 
“great”—Nietzsche, Darwin, Dostoyevsky, Tolstoy, Freud, Jung, Piaget—were 
additionally characterized by lengthy periods of profound psychological unrest and 
uncertainty. Their “psychopathology,” a term ridiculous in this context, was generated as 
a consequence of the revolutionary nature of their personal experience (their action, 
fantasy and thought). It is no great leap of comparative psychology to see their role in our 
society as analogous to that of the archaic religious leader and healer. 

For the average “tribal” individual, socially imposed initiation signifies the death of 
childhood and reintegration on the level of social maturity. For the future shaman, 
voluntarily undertaken initiation signifies the disintegration of socially determined adult 
personality and

Hero 

reintegration at the level of unique individuality. This process is illustrated in Figure 50: 
The “Dual Death” of the Revolutionary Hero. Those who undergo a second initiation 
suffer more deeply and profoundly from life than their peers; they are, in Jung’s phrase, 
the most “complex and differentiated minds of their age.” 425 These creative individuals 
detect emergent anomaly, and begin the process of adaptation to it, long before the 
average person notices any change whatsoever in circumstance. In his ecstasy the shaman 
lives the potential future life of his society. This dangerous individual can play a healing 
role in his community because he has suffered more through experience than his peers. If 
someone in the community (or the community itself) becomes ill, breaks down—begins 
the journey, so speak, to the land of the dead, the terrible unknown—the shaman is there 
to serve as guide, to provide rationale for current experience, to reunite the suffering 
individual with his community or to renew the community—to restabilize the 
paradigmatic context of expectation and desire within which individual and social 
experience remains tolerable. The truly creative individual has “been there and done 
that,” and can therefore serve as a guide to others voluntarily beginning—or roughly 
thrown into—similar voyages. 

The archaic shamanic initiate was commonly someone uniquely marked by fate, by 
the “will of the gods”—by particular heredity, “magical” (novel) occurrence in early 



Maps of meaning 278 


childhood or later in life (birth in a caul; survival of lightning strike), or by intrapsychic 
idiosyncrasy (epileptic susceptibility, visionary proclivity). 426 His unique personality or 
experiential history, in combination with presently extant social conditions, doomed him 
to experience so anomalous that it could not simultaneously be accepted as actually 
occurring—as real—and as possible within the confines determined by ruling social 
presumption. The existence of this experience, if “admitted” and “processed,” therefore 
presented a potentially fatal challenge to the perceived validity of the axioms currently 
underlying the maintenance of normal “sanity”—the sociohistorically determined 
stability of mutually determined behavioral adaptation and experiential significance. The 
existence of this distinct experience served as a gateway to the unknown, or as a 
floodgate, a portal, through which the unexpected could pour, with inevitably destructive 
and potentially creative consequences. The shaman is the individual who chooses to meet 
such a flood head on. 

The shaman, the ecstatic in general—equally, the revolutionary philosopher or 
scientist, true to himself—is characterized by stubborn adherence to his own idiosyncratic 
field of experience, in which occurrences emerge, procedural, episodic or semantic in 
structure, that are foreign to the predictably socialized man and his prosaic moral 
expectation. The experiential range of the creative agent transcends the domain of the 
current adaptive sufficiency of his culture, as it is extant socially and embodied and 
represented intrapsychically. Rather than ignoring or failing to process such occurrences 
(which exist in contradiction to or completely outside his conditional, socially determined 
expectations), and acting as though they do not exist, the creative individual (voluntarily) 
admits their reality, and submits himself to the dissolution of his current (moral) 
worldview and pattern of action. This dissolution of personality, equivalent in episodic 
representation to death, temporarily “renovelizes” experience; furthermore, it provides 
the precondition for more inclusive resurrection of order, personal and social. 

The future shaman is in fact tormented by the incomplete or self-contradictory state of 
his cultural structure, as it is intrapsychically represented; is undergoing a breakdown 
induced by some aspect of personal experience, some existential anomaly, that cannot be 
easily integrated into that structure. This breakdown re-exposes him to the unknown— 
previously covered, so to speak, by his culture. His comportment during the period of 
incubation preceding his emergence as shaman is generally marked by commission of 
acts considered characteristic, in modern and archaic culture alike, of serious mental 
breakdown. He behaves idiosyncratically, seeking solitude, flying into fits of rage, losing 
consciousness, living in the mountains or woods alone, and suffering from visions and 
periods of absentmindedness. His peers explain his odd behavior as possession. This 
experience of dissolution and re-exposure to chaos accompanies intrapsychic subjugation 
to the operation of innate, involuntary [episodic, limbic, right-hemisphere-governed (?)] 
mechanisms responsible for the deconstruction and renewal of conditional knowledge. 
This operation manifests itself subjectively in structured mythic experience—in 
spontaneous personal experience, which adheres to the pattern associated with ritualized 
social initiation, and which may also have served, originally, as its source. 

The soul of the shaman is “carried away by spirits,” habituants of the episodic realm, 
and returned to “the place of the gods.” This place exists outside of time and space itself, 
on the same plane of pleromatic reality as the prehistoric and postapocalyptic Paradise. 
Entry into this domain is preceded by complete psychic disintegration, accompanied by 



The Appearance of Anomaly 279 


horrifying visions of torture, dismemberment and death. The shamanic initiate descends 
into the matriarchal hell that preceded and coexists with creation, passing through 
clashing rocks, or gates in the shape of jaws; he is reduced to a skeleton, while his 
disembodied head observes the procedure; he has his internal organs removed or 
restructured; his bones are broken, his eyes gouged out. He is devoured by a serpent or a 
giantess; is boiled, roasted or otherwise reduced to his essential and fundamental 
structure—to his very bones. Eliade states: 

The total crisis of the future shaman, sometimes leading to complete 
disintegration of the personality and to madness, can be valuated not only 
as an initiatory death but also as a symbolic return to the pre-cosmogonic 
Chaos, to the amorphous and indescribable state that precedes any 
cosmogony. Now, as we know, for archaic and traditional cultures, a 
symbolic return to Chaos is equivalent to preparing a new Creation. It 
follows that we may interpret the psychic Chaos of the future shaman as a 
sign that the profane man is being “dissolved” and a new personality 
being prepared for birth. 427 

This disintegration is the removal of experience—objects and processes—from their 
socially determined state of provisional paradigm-governed significance, and their return 
to the affectively numinous unknown, infinitely threatening and promising. Exposure to 
consequently renovelized experience constitutes the affective and motivational core of 
the ecstatic experience, the basis for the religious experience (and the experience of 
meaning) as such—prior to its entrapment and canalization in dogma. Dissolution is 
experienced in imaginal or episodic representation, as death—an accurate 
conceptualization, death of socialized personality: dissolution of the presently constituted 
intrapsychic representation and procedural embodiment of action patterns historically 
constructed and currently deemed morally acceptable. The justifiable terror consideration 
of the consequences of such decomposition induces constitutes a major impediment to the 
pursuit of redemptive change, a formidable barrier to intrapsychic integration. 

The shamanic “process of transformation” appears as the means by which cognitive 
systems are updated, when necessary; the affect that is released, during the process, is 
necessarily part of the experience. Every major “step forward” therefore has some of the 
aspect of the revolutionary “descent into madness”; change shades gradually from the 
normal to the radical. The structure of this process formulates itself easily into imagistic 
representation—even among children far too young to develop any “explicitly statable” 
knowledge about such occurrences. 

The following dream was described by my daughter, Mikhaila (then three years, nine 
months old), about my son, Julian (one year, eleven months old) on October 5, 1995. 
Julian was in a time of toilet training and rapid speech development, and was having 
some trouble controlling his emotions. Mikhaila liked to call him “baby.” We had several 
discussions about the fact that he really wasn’t a baby anymore. She told me this story, 
while I was at the computer, so I was able to get it verbatim: 

Mikhaila: Julian’s eyes failed out and then he failed into pieces 
Dad: (what sort of pieces?) 



Maps of meaning 280 


Mikhaila: Julian pieces and the bones failed out too then a hole got him and there was 
water in it and when he came out he was big 
Mom: (Julian isn’t a baby anymore?) 

Mikhaila: No he’s a big boy and a bug with legs got him out ’cause bugs can swim and 
the hole was in the park and it moved into the back yard and he failed in it a tree 
burned and left the hole. 

It was the partial “dissolution” of Julian’s previous infantile personality that was causing 
his emotional distress. Mikhaila, upset by his trouble (and curious about the 
disappearance of her “baby”) was trying to understand what her brother was going 
through. Her dream represented his transformation as a “death” and rebirth: First his eyes 
fell out, then he fell into pieces, then his bones came out. Everything went into a “hole,” 
which originally inhabited the nearby park. (The park by our house was forty wooded 
acres; the children and I had gone there at night several times. They found it spooky, but 
exciting. For them, it was the nearest manifestation of the unknown, outside explored and 
familiar territory—prime locale for metaphoric application as source of the “hole,” in 
which transformation takes place.) The hole was full of water, whose symbolism we have 
partially discussed (as the rejuvenating/ destroying “water of life”). The “bug with legs” 
that could “swim” was, I think, a theriomorphized representation of the very archaic 
intrapsychic systems that guide or underlie the transformation of more sophisticated 
cortical or personality “contents.” The notion that a “tree” burned and left the hole is very 
complex. A tree, at minimum, is a sophisticated structure that emerges from basic 
material (from the “ground”). It is also commonly used as a metaphoric representative of 
the essence of the individual human—even of the nervous sys-tem itself 4 "^—as we shall 
see. The tree in this case was therefore also representative of Julian, but in a more 
impersonal way. It stood for, among other things, the personality that was currently 
undergoing transformation. 

Adaptive ability remains necessarily limited to the domain encompassed by a single 
set of principles—a single pattern of action, a single mode of apprehension—in the 
absence of capacity to reconfigure present conceptualizations of morality (morality: 
description of unbearable present, ideal future and means of transformation). Such 
limitation—which is the inability to play games with the rules of the games—means 
dangerous restriction of behavioral and representational flexibility, and increased 
susceptibility to the dangers posed by inevitable “environmental” shift (that is, by 
inevitable re-emergence of the dragon of the unknown). Biologically determined capacity 
for such dissolution—and for its satisfactory resolution—provides the necessary 
precondition for the existence of human capacity for qualitative alteration in adaptation. 
Resolution of crisis—symbolic rebirth—follows, attendant upon initiatory dissolution, 
dismemberment and death. Eliade states: 

The initiatory operations proper always include the renewal of the organs 
and viscera, the cleaning of the bones, and the insertion of magical 
substances—quartz crystals, or pearl shell, or “spirit snakes.” Quartz is 
connected with the “sky world and with the rainbow”; pearl shell is 
similarly connected with the “rainbow serpent,” that is, in sum, still with 
the sky. This sky symbolism goes along with ecstatic ascents to Heaven; 



The Appearance of Anomaly 281 


for in many regions the candidate is believed to visit the sky, whether by 
his own power (for example, by climbing a rope) or carried by a snake. In 
the sky he converses with the Supernatural Beings and mythical Heroes. 

Other initiations involve a descent to the realm of the dead; for example, 
the future medicine man goes to sleep by the burying ground, or enters a 
cave, or is transported underground or to the bottom of a lake. Among 
some tribes, the initiation also includes the novice’s being “roasted” in or 
at a fire. Finally, the candidate is resuscitated by the same Supernatural 
Beings who had killed him, and he is now “a man of Power.” During and 
after his initiation he meets with spirits, Heroes of the mythical Times, 
and souls of the dead—and in a certain sense they all instinct him in the 
secrets of the medicine man’s profession. Naturally, the training proper is 
concluded under the direction of the older masters. In short, the candidate 
becomes a medicine man through a ritual of initiatory death, followed by 
a resurrection to a new and superhuman condition. 429 

The shaman travels up and down the axis mundi, the central pole of the world, the tree of 
life connecting the lower, chthonic reptilian and the upper, celestial avian worlds with the 
central domain of man. This is the “constituent elements of experience” conceived in an 
alternative but familiar arrangement, as heaven above (father above), underworld/matter/ 
earth below (mother below)—conceived in the configuration arranged originally by the 
cosmos-creating hero. The shaman’s success at completing the journey “from earth to the 
domain of the gods” allows him to serve the role of psychopomp, intermediary between 
man and god; to aid the members of his community in adjusting to what remains outside 
of conditional adaptation, when such adaptation fails. The shaman therefore serves his 
society as active intermediary with the unknown; as the conduit, so to speak, through 
which the unknown speaks to man; as the agent through which the information which 
compels adaptive change flows. It is important to note that the shaman’s journey into 
“unknown lands” must be bounded by return to the community for the voyage to be of 
value. Otherwise, the prototypal ecstatic experience—central to the shamanic vocation 
(and to creative thought and action in general)—is mere insanity; will be regarded 
socially and experienced intrapsychically as such. Resolution is psychological 
reconstruction, reincorporation, rebirth “on a higher level”—with redemptive personal 
experience intact, but reintegrated in the corpus of current sociocultural myth and history. 

The ineradicable anomaly that comprises an eternal aspect of existence periodically 
undermines the stability of a subset of unfortunate but gifted individuals. Those who 
maintain their heads during the “journey into the underworld” return, contaminated by 
that underworld, from the perspective of their compatriots, but rife with possibility for 
reordering the world. Such recovery is in essence the transformation of assumption and 
value—individual, then cultural. History is an invaluable storehouse of the creative 
experience and wisdom of the past. Past wisdom is not always sufficient to render present 
potentiality habitable. If the structure of experience itself was static and finite, like the 
past, all things would have been conquered long ago, and the lives of the ancestors and 
their children would differ little in kind. But the structure of experience is dynamic and 
infinite in possibility. The nature of experience itself varies with time. New challenges 
and dangers appear out of the future, into the present, where none existed before. History, 



Maps of meaning 282 


as description of the past, is incomplete, as well as static. It must therefore exist in 
constant conflict with new experiences. The spirit underlying the transmutation of culture 
resolves unbearable intrapsychic conflict with shattering revelation, first to the individual, 
then to society at large. The creative individual “dies”—metaphysically and, too often, 
literally—for those who follow him, instead of sharing the common destiny of his peers. 
Those who bear the initial burden for the forward movement of history are capable of 
transforming personal idiosyncrasy and revelation into collective reality, without 
breaking down under the weight of isolation and fear. Such creativity is feared and hated 
and desired and worshiped by every human individual and by human society in general. 
Creative individuals destroy old values and threaten with chaos, but they also bear light 
and the promise of better things. It is in this manner that the “sacrifice of the 
revolutionary savior” redeems and rekindles the cosmos. 

The revolutionary hero is the individual who decides voluntarily, courageously, to face 
some aspect of the unknown and threatening. He may also be the only person who is 
presently capable of perceiving that social adaptation is incompletely or improperly 
structured in a particular way; only he understands that there still remain unconquered 
evil spirits, dangerous unknowns and threatening possibilities. In taking creative action, 
he (re)encounters chaos, generates new myth-predicated behavioral strategies, and 
extends the boundaries (or transforms the paradigmatic structure) of cultural competence. 
The well-adapted man identifies with what has been, conserves past wisdom, and is 
therefore protected from the unknown. The hero, by contrast, author and editor of history, 
masters the known, exceeds its bounds, and then subjects it to restructuring—exposing 
chaos once more to view in the process—or pushes back unknown frontiers, establishing 
defined territory where nothing but fear and hope existed before. The hero overcomes 
nature, the Great Mother, entering into creative union with her; reorganizing culture, the 
Great Father, in consequence. Such reintegration and resurrection is in essence the 
metamorphosis of individual, and then cultural, moral presumption. Cumulative socially 
mediated transmission of the past consequences of such creation and intrapsychic 
reorganization constitutes group identity, culture itself—the canon of assumptions and 
values that underlie behavior, the eternal shield against the terrible unknown. 

The hero is the first person to have his “internal structure” (that is, his hierarchy of 
values and his behaviors) reorganized as a consequence of contact with an emergent 
anomaly. His “descent into the underworld” and subsequent reorganization make him a 
savior—but his contact with the dragon of chaos also contaminates him with the forces 
that disrupt tradition and stability. The reigning status-quo stability may be only 
apparent—that is, the culture in its present form may already be doomed by as-of-yet not 
fully manifested change. The hero detects the dragon, or at least admits to its presence, 
before anyone else, and leads the charge. His return to the kingdom of threatened order 
may hardly be accompanied by praise, however, since the information he now carries (or 
perhaps is) will appear disruptive and destructive long before it proves redemptive. It is 
very easy to view the hero as the most profound danger to the state, in consequence—and 
this would in fact be true if the absolute stasis of the state did not constitute a more 
fundamental danger. Figure 51: The Crucified Redeemer as Dragon of Chaos and 
Transformation 430 presents the savior as serpent, in keeping with his “contamination” by 
the unknown. 4 ' 1 



The Appearance of Anomaly 283 


Figure 52: The Socially Destructive and Redemptive “Journey” of the 
Revolutionary Hero schematically presents the “way of the savior.” The individual 
troubled by anomalous and anxiety-provoking experience is suffering equally from the 
disintegration, rigidity or senility of the society within. The decision to “mine” such 
experience for significance—and to destabilize the socially constructed intrapsychic 
hierarchy of behavior and values, is in consequence equivalent, mythologically speaking, 
to the “descent to the underworld.” If this descent is successful—that is, if the exploring 
individual does not retreat to his previous personality structure, and wall himself in, and 
if he does not fall prey to hopelessness, anxiety and despair—then he may “return” to the 
community, treasure in hand, with information whose incorporation would benefit 
society. It is very likely, however, that he will be viewed with fear and even hatred, as a 
consequence of his “contamination with the unknown,” particularly if those left behind 
are unconscious of the threat that motivated his original journey. His contamination is 
nothing to be taken lightly, besides. If the exploratory figure has in fact derived a new 
mode of adaptation or representation, necessary for the continued success and survival of 
the group, substantial social change is inevitable. This process of change will throw those 
completely identified with the group into the realm of chaos, against their will. Such an 
involuntary descent into the underworld is a very dangerous undertaking, as we have 
seen, particularly in the absence of identification with the hero. This means that it is 
primarily those persons who have sold their soul to the group who cannot distinguish

between the hero and the dragon of chaos (between the hero and the environmental 
disaster, the death of the king, the dangerous stranger or the heretical idea). 

The more tyrannical the attitude, the more those who hold it hate and fear the hero, 
victim and beneficiary of the creative illness: 

Let us lie in wait for the righteous man, because he is inconvenient to us 
and opposes our actions; he reproaches us for sins against the law, and 
accuses us of sins against our training. 

He professes to have knowledge of God, and calls himself a child of 
the Lord. 

Let us see if his words are true, and let us test what will happen at the 
end of his life; for if the righteous man is God’s son, he will help him, and 
will deliver him from the hand of his adversaries. 

Let us test him with insult and torture, that we may find out how gentle 
he is, and make trial of his forbearance.

Figure 52: The Socially Destructive and Redemptive 
“Journey” of the Revolutionary Hero 

Let us condemn him to a shameful death, for, according to what he says, 
he will be protected. 

(Wisdom 2:12-13, 16-20 RSV) 

The tyrannical attitude maintains society in homogeneity and rigid predictability, but 
dooms it to eventual collapse. This arrogant traditionalism, masquerading as moral virtue, 
is merely unexpressed fear of leaving the beaten path, of forging the new trail—the 
entirely comprehensible but nonetheless unforgivable shrinking from destiny, as a 
consequence of lack of faith in personal ability and precisely equivalent fear of the 
unknown. The inevitable result of such failure is restriction of meaning —by definition, as 
meaning exists on the border between the known and the unknown. Repression of 
personal experience, which is failure to update action and representation in the face of an 
anomalous occurrence, means damming up the river of life; means existence on the 
barren plain, in the paralyzed kingdom, in the eternal drought. It is personal experience— 
anathema to the fascist; eternally superseding group categorization and the interpretations 
of the dead—that is novel and endlessly refreshing. 

The security of predictable society provides an antidote to fear, but a too-rigid society 
ensures its own eventual destruction. The future brings with it the unknown; inflexibility 
and unwillingness to change therefore bring the certainty of extinction. Adaptive 



Maps of meaning 286 


behavior is created and/or transformed by those driven to resolve the tension inevitably 
existing between dynamic personal experience and society—driven to resolve the tension 
between what they know to be true and what history claims. Readaptation, during times 
of crisis, does not necessarily constitute simple addition to the body of historical 
knowledge, although that is heroic endeavor as well. Full readaptation may necessitate 
revolutionary measures, partial or complete reincarnation—dissolution to constituent 
elements, and systemic reorganization. Such reorganization alters the meaning of 
experience, and therefore, the mythology of history and being. If resolution is not reached 
in time of crisis, mental illness (for the individual) or cultural degeneration (for the 
society) threatens. This “mental illness” (failure of culture, failure of heroism) is return to 
domination by the unknown—in mythological terms, expressed as involuntary incest 
(destructive union) with the Terrible Mother. 

The revolutionary hero opens himself up to the possibility of advancement—to 
furtherance of his culture’s central myth—by placing himself beyond the protective 
enclave of history and by exposing his vulnerability to the terrible nature of reality. In 
psychological terms, the hero discovers the limitations of history; discovers the 
nakedness of the father (Genesis 9:20-25). He must, therefore, challenge history, and 
face what it had previously protected him from. Subsequent contact with the Terrible 
Mother means exposure to absolute mortal vulnerability—to the existence and 
consequence of ignorance, insanity, cruelty, disease and death. The revolutionary hero 
faces the reality of his vulnerability and fights a battle with terror. 

The constant transcendence of the future serves to destroy the absolute sufficiency of 
all previous historically determined systems, and ensures that the path defined by the 
revolutionary hero remains the one constant route to redemption. The “revolutionary 
hero” is embodiment and narrative representation of the action of consciousness itself. 
This mythically masculine principle emerges from its identity with chaos and culture, and 
stands as an independently divine phenomenon, equivalent in potential strength to the 
destructive, generative, protective and tyrannical forces that make up human experience. 
The hero is the individual who has found the “third solution” to his existential problems, 
the alternative to decadence and authoritarianism. When faced with a paradox whose 
solution is impossible in terms of the historical canon (that established axiomatically 
predicated hierarchy of values and assumptions) he takes inspired action and transcends 
his culturally determined limitations. Instead of denying the existence of the problem— 
and, therefore, tormenting those who cannot help but posit it—the revolutionary hero 
accepts the apparently impossible task of solution, and of reuniting the warring opposites. 
He admits the possibility of successful solution not because the problem can be 
minimized, but because he believes human nature can expand to meet it. Such belief— 
faith—provides the precondition for courage. His act of voluntary transcendence re¬ 
exposes him to the brute force of the unknown (and to the anger of the social group) but 
enables creative action. The hero’s ability to risk standing alone—neither rejecting his 
culture because he is ignorant of its value, nor running away from it in panic because of 
fear—offers him the possibility of attaining true stature, although not necessarily acclaim 
or popularity. 

The true absolute in the individual, which can meet the absolute unknown, is the 
heroic aspect, which cannot be made finally subject to tyranny and is not ruled by the 
past. This is the spirit that created civilization, which must not be bound, within the 



The Appearance of Anomaly 287 


individual, by abject subjugation to what has already been. The man who stands outside 
of culture necessarily places himself against nature and the world. This seems a hopeless 
position. But man knows little of his true potential, and in that ignorance lies his hope: 

This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is 
become the head of the corner. (Acts 4:11) 


THE RISE OF SELF-REFERENCE, AND THE PERMANENT 
CONTAMINATION OF ANOMALY WITH DEATH 

The appearance of anomaly can be less or more upsetting. Small 
“manifestations of the unknown” disrupt relatively small tracts of 
“explored territory.” Larger manifestations may disrupt all things 
previously taken for granted, even things invisible. 

Upsetting manifestations of the unknown may occur as a 
consequence of “outside forces,” geological, meteorological, even 
cosmological. Similarly, social transformations may upset the 
stable and familiar. Wars, revolutions and migrations make the 
conditional nature of everything taken for granted evident once 
more. 

Internal transformations are just as likely to introduce instability. 
The process of maturation, in and of itself, is sufficient to disrupt 
the previously stable and well-adapted personality and the little 
society of the family. Crises in adaptation may be brought about in 
childhood at the onset of schooling and first independent contact 
with the unmediated social world. The hormonal changes and new 
social demands of youth may likewise transform the happy and 
reasonable child into the depressed and hostile adolescent. 

Some internal transformations are also natural and social 
events. The ever-expanding human capacity for abstract thinking, 
for example, appears to be a consequence of biological and social 
forces, working synergistically. The human brain has evolved 
exceptionally quickly, from the phylogenetic perspective. The 
language-mediated interpersonal interaction characteristic of ever- 
larger human societies has provided that rapidly developing 
biological capacity with information whose sophistication and 
breadth is increasing exponentially. This means that the human 
mind increasingly manifests the capacity to upset itself, to produce 
revelations, so to speak, that knock gaping holes in the previously 
sufficient adaptive and protective social and intrapsychic structures. 

The human capacity for abstraction has enabled us as a species 
and as individuals to produce self-models that include the temporal 
boundaries of existence. We have become able to imagine our own 
deaths, and the deaths of those we love, and to make a link 
between mortal fragility and every risk we encounter. Emergence of 



Maps of meaning 288 


such capacity-which reoccurs with the maturation of every new 
human being-introduces the most intractable anomaly imaginable 
into the developmental course of every life. 

Myth represents the ever-recurring appearance of this 
representational ability-this emergent “self-consciousness,” the 
heritable sin of Adam-as incorporation of the “forbidden fruit,” 
development of knowledge of good and evil, and consequent 
expulsion from paradise. This appearance is an event of “cosmic 
significance,” driving the separation of heaven and earth, making 
human experience something “eternally fallen,” something ever in 
need of redemption. 

The unknown has become permanently contaminated with 
death, for Homo sapiens. This contamination has tremendously 
heightened our general motivation-our fear and curiosity-as we are 
able to perceive the potential that lurks behind every anomalous 
event. Our cultural creations-our great societies and the beliefs that 
accompany them—can be profitably viewed as driven by our 
knowledge of mortality, and by the energy (the heightened 
alertness and penetrating consciousness) such knowledge 
inspires. 

Our great transpersonal cognitive power, however, has not yet 
rescued us from the valley of the shadow of death. 

What man is found such an idiot as to suppose that God planted trees 
in Paradise, in Eden, like a husbandman, and planted therein the tree 
of Life, perceptible to the eyes and sense, which gave life to the eater 
thereof; and another tree which gave to the eater thereof a knowledge 
of good and evil? I believe that every man must hold these things for 
images, under which the hidden sense lies concealed. 432 

The meta-mythology of the Way portrays the manner in which specific ideas about the 
present, the future, and the mode of transforming one into the other are initially 
constructed, and then reconstructed in their entirety, when such transformation becomes 
necessary. This meta-myth provides the deep structure linking other classes of myths, 
including those describing the current or pre-existence stable state, those that portray the 
emergence of something unexpected into that state, those that represent the dissolution of 
paradise, in consequence, and those that describe the regeneration of stability. This cyclic 
pattern is essentially characteristic of the development of consciousness, of the capacity 
to act and represent—which is regarded from the mythic perspective as akin to the 
creation of the world. 

The “previous place of stability,” destroyed as a consequence of emergent anomaly, 
may be apprehended either as “the paradise that once reigned,” from the perspective of 
the chaos engendered by its collapse, or as “the rigid and tyrannical past,” from the 
perspective of revitalized and renewed order. Myths of paradise and the fall typically 
describe the first dynamic elements of the way from the perspective of “the chaos 
presently reigning”—that is, from the position of the uncertainty and fear that 



The Appearance of Anomaly 289 


characterizes profane and worldly life. From this standpoint, human life is existence in 
the “valley of the shadow of death,” contaminated by the unbearable and unreturnable 
gift of the knowledge of good and evil. Myths of redemption—that is, of the ascent from 
chaos, of the return to paradise, or of the “flight” to heaven—are tales “designed” to 
describe the process of remediation for the “prehistoric” fall. Such myths lay out a 
morality whose incorporation or incarnation constitutes cure for the spiritual paralysis 
engendered by emergent knowledge of death. 

The idea of primeval paradise, then paradise lost—of the origin of experience, the rise 
of (self)consciousness, then permanent, heritable fall, descent from grace—appears as a 
constant predicate of human culture, distributed throughout the world. Even the most 
technologically primitive of people, whose styles of existence were often mistaken for 
paradisal by the Europeans who first encountered them, generally considered themselves 
fallen from an earlier condition of perfection. For them, like us, the noble savage was an 
ancestral Adamic figure, who could communicate directly with God: 

When Fleaven had been abruptly separated from the earth, that is, when it 
had become remote, as in our days; when the tree or liana connecting 
Earth to Fleaven had been cut; or the mountain which used to touch the 
sky had been flattened out—then the paradisiac stage was over, and man 
entered into his present condition. In effect, all [myths of paradise] show 
us primordial man enjoying a beatitude, a spontaneity and freedom, which 
he has unfortunately lost in consequence of the fait —that is, of what 
followed upon the mythical event that caused the rapture between Heaven 
and Earth. 4 " 

The idea of paradise encompasses somewhat more than the “previous place of stability.” 
It is actually all previous places of stability, concatenated into a single representation. 
Every previous place of stability becomes in this manner order, as such, balanced 
perfectly with potential—becomes existence without suffering, in Eden or Paradise, in 
the “walled garden of delight” (“Eden, signifies in Hebrew ‘delight, a place of 
delight’...our own English word Paradise, which is from the Persian, pain —“around,” 
daeza —“a wall,” means properly a walled enclosure. Apparently, then, Eden is a walled 
garden of delight.” 434 ). Paradise is the place where the perfect harmony of order and 
chaos eliminates suffering, while bringing forth the necessities and pleasures of life 
without work or effort. Chaos and order are integrated, perfectly, in the paradisal state. 

Paradise therefore also partakes of the state of the “cosmos” before its division into the 
ever-warring constituent elements of experience. This uroboric condition or state, 
conceptualized as a mode of being that is free from or beyond opposition, is also by 
necessity that place or state of being where suffering—a consequence of limitation and 
opposition—does not exist. This form of symbolic representation seems somewhat 
paradoxical, as it is the “dragon of chaos” that generates dread anxiety, when it manifests 
itself unexpectedly. However, context determines salience—determines meaning —in 
mythology as elsewhere. The conditions of existence—that is, the balance obtained by 
the forces of order, chaos and consciousness—not infrequently appear as intolerable, in 
and of themselves (in the state of anxiety and pain characterized by severe grief or 
depression, for example). From this perspective, the state of nonbeing (equivalent to 



Maps of meaning 290 


identity with precosmogonic chaos) is the absence of all possibility of suffering. In the 
state of ideation characterizing suicide, for example, the Great Mother beckons. A student 
of mine, who had undergone a relatively severe crisis of identity, told me the following 
story: 


I took a trip to the ocean. There were cliffs behind the beach. I was 
standing on one of the cliffs, looking out over the water. I was in a 
depressed state of mind. I looked out to the horizon. I could see the figure 
of a beautiful woman in the clouds. She gestured for me to come forward. 

I almost went over the edge, before I came out of my fantasy. 

My wife told me a very similar tale. When she was in late adolescence, feeling somewhat 
unsettled, she took a camping trip on the sides of a deep river bank near her hometown. 
She stayed overnight on a bluff overlooking a steep drop. In the morning, the fog came 
off the river and filled the valley. She walked to the edge. 

I saw the clouds below me. They looked like big, soft pillows. I imagined 
diving in, where it was warm and comfortable. But part of me knew 
better. 

The state of non-existence—the state before the opening of Pandora’s box—can under 
many conditions appear a state worth (re)attaining. 

The common metaphor of Paradise as geographic place serves to concretize a complex 
state of affairs, whose intrinsic nature would otherwise remain entirely beyond grasp. It 
brings down to earth the a priori conditions of the spirit and renders them initially 
comprehensible, at least in the symbolic sense. Paradise as place or state is perfected 
interpersonal interaction—the harmony of the lion and the lamb—as well as spiritual 
harmony (is the “internal kingdom” and the “external kingdom” simultaneously united as 
the “kingdom of God”). Paradise is also the world before it became profane—before 
innocence was lost. 

Myths of “the paradise of childhood” use the circumstances applying at the dawn of 
each individual life—prior to separation of mother and child—as metaphor for the “place 
of beginnings.” The symbiotic mother-child relationship is a union of elements that will 
in time become separate. The intimate union of two individuals at the beginning of a life 
comprises a state that is one thing, and more than one thing, simultaneously. This 
concrete example of a unity that is at the same time a plurality can be used in abstraction, 
to represent the hypothetical pretemporal state itself, where everything that would be 
more than one thing still “existed” in inseparable identity. This unity—the unviolated 
original state—tends to take on the affective evaluation of perfection (since it is the place 
where there is no conflict, no “separation of opposites”). 

Widespread iconic representations of the Holy Virgin Mother and Child, for 
example—Christian and non-Christian—might be regarded as crystallized fantasies about 
the affective nature of the origin. In the ideal mother-infant union, every desire remains 
absolutely bounded by love. The state of early childhood, more generally, symbolizes 
freedom from conflict; symbolizes honest, innocent, idyllic human existence, immersion 
in love, life before the necessary corruption of social contact, life preceding exposure to 



The Appearance of Anomaly 291 


the harshly punitive conditions of physical existence. Childhood represents (perhaps, is) 
existence prior to the discovery of mortality. This lack of contamination by knowledge of 
death lends childhood experience an ideal quality, which easily comes to serve the mythic 
imagination as model for the state of being that transcends the existential anxiety of 
adulthood. The child, father to the man, represents the past of man; additionally, 
represents human potential, and man’s eternal hope for the future. The Hasidim believe, 
for example, that “the Zaddik [the perfect, righteous man] finds that which has been lost 
since birth, and restores it to man.” 4 ’ 5 In the Christian tradition, likewise, it is held that 
“except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the 
Kingdom of Heaven” (Matthew 3:3). Maturation means expansion of ability, 
differentiation of self and world, transformation of possibility into actuality, but loss of 
potential as well, as anything developed develops in one direction, and not in any of the 
innumerable alternatives. Growth therefore also means decline, as each step toward 
adulthood is one step closer to death. 

The initial paradisal state is typically disrupted, in mythological representation, by 
some fateful act undertaken by man—by some act that places him in opposition to his 
heavenly source. Such opposition is painful, and is often portrayed as a dreadful mistake 
or sin. It is nonetheless the case that the origin of experience and history—that is, the 
origin of being itself—appears inextricably bound up with such opposition, with 
differentiation from the origin. The initial paradisal state, although characterized by 
absolute totality, nonetheless seems paradoxically flawed; it suffers from an 
indeterminate form of non-existence—lacks reality itself: 

There was something formless, yet complete, that existed before Heaven 
and Earth; 

Without sound, without substance, dependent on nothing, unchanging, 
all-pervading, unfailing. 

One may think of it as the Mother of all things under Heaven. 4 ’ 6 

Such non-existence appears as an inevitable consequence of the absence of limitation, or 
of opposition. This absence deprives whatever constitutes the origin of a point of 
reference, distinguishable from itself—and, therefore, deprives it of existence. As a place 
(as the “previous state of innocent being”), paradise retains a patina of carefree existence. 
This is diminished by the comparative unreality of that existence. Things have not yet 
fallen apart in the Garden of Eden—have not yet separated (completely) into their 
constituent elements. Two things that cannot be discerned from one another are not two 
things, however, and one thing with no discernible features whatsoever may not even be. 

Paradise is the world, before it has become realized. In such a state, nothing suffers, 
and nothing dies, because there is no defined one to suffer—no one aware of either the 
nature of subjective being, or the meaning of such being, once it has become “detached” 
from the whole. The “primordial ancestor,” simultaneously male and female, dwells in 
this unrealized place, prior to division into husband and wife; 437 exists, unselfconsciously, 
even after that division: 

And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 
(Genesis 2:25) 



Maps of meaning 292 


To “know” nakedness and to be shamed by it is to understand exposure, weakness and 
vulnerability. To be exposed before a crowd and the world is to have the essential frailty 
of individual being dramatically and incontrovertibly demonstrated. To be unaware of 
nakedness—to lack “self-consciousness”—is to be much less troubled, but also to be 
much less. The “paradisal” world of the child is much less—much less manifest, that is— 
than the world of the adult. The child has fewer responsibilities, and fewer defined 
concerns, than the adult. This lends childhood a glamour that mature existence lacks, at 
least from a certain adult perspective. But it is also the case that the child has a terrible 
vulnerability that the adult has transcended. The child does not explicitly perceive his 
vulnerability, and therefore does not suffer, until that vulnerability tragically manifests 
itself. The adult, by contrast, knows he can be hurt, and suffers constantly for that 
knowledge. His “heightened consciousness”—self-consciousness, really—means that he 
can take steps to ensure his healthy survival, however (even though he must in 
consequence worry for the future). The world of the child is circumscribed, incompletely 
realized, but nonetheless vulnerable. The paradisal world is incomplete, yet threatened, in 
the same manner. 

It is primordial separation of light from darkness—engendered by Logos, the Word, 
equivalent to the process of consciousness—that initiates human experience and 
historical activity (which is reality itself, for all intents and purposes). This initial division 
provides the prototypic structure, and the fundamental precondition, for the elaboration 
and description of more differentiated attracting and repulsing pairs of opposites: 

In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth. 

And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the 
face of the deep. And the Spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters. 

And God said. Let there be light; and there was light. 

And God saw the light, that it was good; and God divided the light 
from the darkness. (Genesis 1:1-4) 

Light and darkness constitute mythic totality; order and chaos, in paradoxical union, 
provide primordial elements of the entire experiential universe. Light is illumination, 
inspiration; darkness, ignorance and degeneration. Light is the newly risen sun, the 
eternal victor of the endless cyclical battle with the serpent of the night; it is the savior, 
the mythic hero, the deliverer of humanity. Light is gold, the king of metals, pure and 
incorruptible, a symbol for civilized value itself. Light is Apollo, the sun king, god of 
enlightenment, clarity and focus; spirit, opposed to black matter; bright “masculinity,” 
opposed to the dark and unconscious “feminine.” Light is Marduk, the Babylonian hero, 
god of the morning and spring day, who struggles against Tiamat, monstrous goddess of 
death and the night. Light is Horus, who fights against evil and redeems the father. Light 
is Christ, who transcends the past, and extends to all individuals identity with the divine 
Logos. To exist in the light means to be born, to live, to be redeemed. To depart from the 
light means to choose the path of evil—spiritual death—or to perish bodily altogether. 

Myth equates the origin of the universe of experience with the partition of light from 
darkness because of the analogical or metaphorical identity between that separation and 
the mysterious differentiation of conscious experience from unconscious nonawareness. 
Awareness and daytime experience are inextricably united, like oblivion and the night. 



The Appearance of Anomaly 293 


Darkness places severe, uncontrollable external transpersonal limitations upon waking 
human awareness, by eliminating or dramatically restricting visually dependent temporal 
and spatial sensory extension. The blackness of the night brings with it the re-emergence 
of the unknown, and the eternal human sense of subjugation to those terrors still 
incomprehensibly embedded in experience: 

When sacred Night sweeps heavenward, she takes 
the glad, the winsome day, and folding it, 
rolls up its golden carpet that had been 
spread over an abysmal pit. 

Gone vision-like is the external world, 
and man, a homeless orphan, has to face,

the blackness of immeasurable space. 

Upon himself he has to lean; with mind

depths of his soul he sinks, for nothing comes 
from outside to support or limit him. 

All life and brightness seem an ancient dream—

External “cosmic” forces veil the day with the night. Similarly, and as a consequence of 
equally uncontrollable and impersonal “internal” forces, consciousness vanishes, into 
sleep, in the night: 439 

The central metaphor underlying “beginning” is not really birth at all. It is 
rather the moment of waking from sleep, when one world disappears and 
another comes into being. This is still contained within a cycle: we know 
that at the end of the day we shall return to the world of sleep, but in the 
meantime there is a sense of self-transcendence, of a consciousness 
getting ‘up’ from an unreal into a real, or at least more real, world. This 
sense of awakening into a greater degree of reality is expressed by 
Heraclitus.. .as a passing from a world where everyone has his own 
“logos” into a world where there is a common “logos.” Genesis presents 
the Creation as a sudden coming into being of a world through articulate 
speech (another aspect of logos), conscious perception, light and stability. 
Something like this metaphor of awakening may be the real reason for the 
emphasis on “days,” and such recurring phrases as “And the evening and 
the morning were the first day,” even before the day as we know it was 
established with the creating of the sun. 440 

The temporary nocturnal state of nonexistence appears similar to the more permanent 
situation theoretically prevailing prior (?) to the dawn of awareness as such, where there

was no subject, no object, and no experience at all—but where the possibility of such 
things somehow lay dormant. 

There is no suffering in the Garden of Eden. In such a state, however, things do not 
really exist. In consequence, myth appears to have equated the establishment of the 
opposition necessary> to being with the appearance and evolution of the limited subject, 
who serves creation as the mirror of God. In the mythic world, the very existence of 
experience—past, present and future—appears dependent upon experience of the 
spatially and temporally limited observer. Restricted in their manifestation in this 
manner—that is, manifest in the domain of individual experience—things attain a brief, 
differentiated existence, before they crash into their opposites and vanish forever. An 
ancient midrash states, in this vein, that “God and man are in a sense twins.” 441 The 
modern physicist John Wheeler states, analogously: 

In every elementary quantum process the act of observation, or the act of 
registration, or the act of observer-participancy, or whatever we choose to 
call it, plays an essential part in giving “tangible reality” to that which we 
say is happening. [Paradoxically:] The universe exists “out there” 
independent of acts of registration, but the universe does not exist out 
there independent of acts of registration. 442 

From the standard perspective, objective things exist, in and of themselves. But this 
viewpoint eliminates the necessity of the observer, who gives to all things a necessary 
vantage point, reducing indefinable virtuality to extant actuality. Myth makes no such 
mistake, equating the very presence of being and becoming with the emergence of 
consciousness and self-consciousness. 443 It is this equation that allows the mythic 
imagination to place man at the center of the universe, and to draw an analogy between 
the principle that makes order out of chaos, and the individual himself. 

The mythic world—the world, as it is experienced—might in fact be considered an 
emergent property of first-order self-reference; might be regarded as the interaction 
between the universe as subject and the universe as object. Myth equates the origin with 
the dawning of light, with the emergence of consciousness: equates the universe with the 
world of experience; assumes that the subjective is a precondition of the real. This idea 
seems exceedingly foreign to modern sensibility, which is predicated upon the 
historically novel proposition that the objective material in and of itself constitutes the 
real, and that subjective experience, which in fact provides source material for the 
concept of the object, is merely an epiphenomenal appendage. However, it is the case that 
self-referential systems (like that consisting of being as subject and object, 
simultaneously) are characterized by the emergence of unexpect-ed and qualitatively 
unique properties. The world as subject (that is, the individual) is an exceedingly 
complex phenomenon—more complex, by far, than anything else (excepting other 
subjects). The world as object is hardly less mysterious. It is reasonable to regard the 
interaction of the two as something even more remarkable. We think: matter first, then 
subject —and presume that matter, as we understand it, is that which exists in the absence 
of our understanding. But the “primal matter” of mythology (a more comprehensive 
“substance” than the matter of the modern world) is much more than mere substance: it is 
the source of everything, objective and subjective (is matter and spirit, united in essence). 



The Appearance of Anomaly 295 


From this perspective, consciousness is fundamental to the world of experience—as 
fundamental as “things” themselves. The matter of mythology therefore seems more than 
“superstition, that must be transcended”—seems more than the dead stuff of the modern 
viewpoint. 

Furthermore, the world of experience appears generated by the actions of 
consciousness—by dawning awareness—in more than one “stage.” The “purely 
conscious awareness” which hypothetically exists prior to the generation of active 
representations of the self—that is, which accompanied the mere division of “object” and 
“subject”—still retains essential unity and associated “paradisal” elements. Adam and 
Eve exist as independent beings prior to their “fall,” but still commune with the animals 
and walk with God. Sheltered in an eternally productive garden, blissfully ignorant of 
their essential nakedness and vulnerability, they exist without anxious care or toil. It is 
the emergence of second-order self-reference—awareness of the self; self- 
consciousness—which finally disrupts this static state of perfection, and irreversibly 
alters the nature of experience. (The development of consciousness—the apprehension of 
the system by “itself’—adds one form of self-reference to the universal structure, Self- 
consciousness —the apprehension of the subject by himself—appears to have added 
another.) The modern mind would consider nothing fundamental altered by such internal 
transformation (as it considers consciousness epiphenomenal to reality). The 
mythological mind adopts another stance, entirely, presuming as it does that 
consciousness is allied with the very creator of things. From this viewpoint, cognitive 
transformations alter the structure of existence—change the very relationship between 
heaven and earth, creator and created; permanently restructure the cosmos itself. The 
modern materialist would consider such a theory arrogant and presumptious, to say the 
least. Nonetheless, the great societies of East and West are predicated precisely upon 
such a viewpoint—upon myths of origin and fall, characterized by uncanny structural 
parallel: 

The father of Prince Gautama, the Buddha, savior of the Orient, 
determined to protect his son from desperate knowledge and tragic 
awareness, built for him an enclosed pavilion, a walled garden of earthly 
delights. Only the healthy, the young, and the happy were allowed access 
to this earthly paradise. All signs of decay and degeneration were thus 
kept hidden from the prince. Immersed in the immediate pleasures of the 
senses, in physical love, in dance, and music, in beauty, and pleasure, 
Gautama grew to maturity, protected absolutely from the limitations of 
mortal being. However, he grew curious, despite his father’s most 
particular attention and will, and resolved to leave his seductive prison. 

Preparations were made, to gild his chosen route, to cover the 
adventurer’s path with flowers, and to display for his admiration and 
preoccupation the fairest women of the kingdom. The prince set out, with 
full retinue, in the shielded comfort of a chaperoned chariot, and delighted 
in the panorama previously prepared for him. The gods, however, decided 
to disrupt these most carefully laid plans, and sent an aged man to hobble, 
in hill view, alongside the road. The prince’s fascinated gaze fell upon the 
ancient interloper. Compelled by curiosity, he asked his attendant: 



Maps of meaning 296 


“What is that creature stumbling, shabby, bent and broken, beside my 
retinue?” and the attendant answered: 

“That is a man, like other men, who was born an infant, became a 
child, a youth, a husband, a father, a father of fathers. He has become old, 
subject to destruction of his beauty, his will, and the possibilities of life.” 

“Like other men, you say?” hesitantly inquired the prince. “That 
means.. .this will happen to me?” and the attendant answered: 

“Inevitably, with the passage of time.” 

The world collapsed in upon Gautama, and he asked to be returned to 
the safety of home. In time, his anxiety lessened, his curiosity grew, and 
he ventured outside again. This time the gods sent a sick man into view. 

“This creature,” he asked his attendant, “shaking and palsied, horribly 
afflicted, unbearable to behold, a source of pity and contempt: what is 
he?” and the attendant answered: 

“That is a man, like other men, who was born whole, but who became 
ill and sick, unable to cope, a burden to himself and others, suffering and 
incurable.” 

“Like other men, you say?” inquired the prince. “This could happen to 
me?” and the attendant answered: 

“No man is exempt from the ravages of disease.” 

Once again the world collapsed, and Gautama returned to his home. 
But the delights of his previous life were ashes in his mouth, and he 
ventured forth a third time. The gods, in their mercy, sent him a dead man, 
in funeral procession. 

“This creature,” he asked his attendant, “laying so still, appearing so 
fearsome, surrounded by grief and by sorrow, lost and forlorn: what is 
he?” and the attendant answered: 

“That is a man, like other men, born of woman, beloved and hated, 
who once was like you, and now is the earth.” 

“Like other men, you say?” inquired the Prince. “Then...this could 
happen to me?” 

“This is your end,” said the attendant, “and the end of all men.” 

The world collapsed, a final time, and Gautama asked to be returned 
home. But the attendant had orders from the prince’s father, and took him 
instead to a festival of women, occurring nearby in a grove in the woods. 
The prince was met by a beautiful assemblage, who offered themselves 
freely to him, without restraint, in song, and in dance, in play, in the spirit 
of sensual love. But Gautama could think only of death, and the inevitable 
decomposition of beauty, and took no pleasure in the display. 


The myth of the Buddha is the story of individual development, considered in the ideal. 
The 



The Appearance of Anomaly 297 



Figure 53: The (Voluntary) Descent of the Buddha 

story opens with Gautama’s father, shielding his child from the dangers of the world, 
much as any child in a healthy family is shielded. As the young prince matures, however, 
and becomes increasingly curious, he starts to wonder about the “world beyond.” 
Children who develop within a safe and secure family grow into individuals who can no 
longer be contained by that family. It is the “good parent” who “fails,” necessarily, by 
fostering a child who rapidly becomes so independent that parenting no longer suffices. 
Each foray out into the world produces an increase in knowledge, and a commensurate 
decrease in the ability of the childhood family constellation and personality to “map the 
world”—to provide acceptable patterns of action and representation, for existence as a 
true individual. The future Buddha’s encounter with his intrinsic mortal limitations 
destroyed his childhood paradise, tragically—but propelled him out into the world as an 
independent being. This story can be portrayed, in the familiar manner, as in Figure 53: 
The (Voluntary) Descent of the Buddha. The story of Gautama’s maturation details the 
consequential contamination of existence with unbearable anxiety; describes the 
association, in potential, even of beauty and the most fundamental and necessary of 
biological pleasures with the inevitability of decay and of death, the ulti-mate 
punishment. The Buddha’s struggle with and eventual victory over his emergent tragic 
self-consciousness comprises the rest of the great tale: first, Gautama incorporated the 
knowledge of his ancestors; then, he transcended and restructured that knowledge. 





Maps of meaning 298 


After leaving the “walled garden” of his childhood, Gautama became a master of 
tradition, in his attempt to make sense of the world of experience as it now presented 
itself to him. He developed extensive knowledge of various philosophies, including 
Samkhya and Yoga, leaving each in turn as insufficient, and then took asceticism— 
worldly renunciation—to an extreme: “reduced almost to the state of a skeleton, he 
finally came to resemble a heap of dust.” 444 That approach, too, proved insufficient. 
Finally, having tasted everything life had to offer, and having developed the discipline of 
a dedicated adherent, he prepared himself for his final battle. He entered a vast forest (the 
spiritual home of the unknown), placed himself at the foot of a pipal tree, and resolved to 
remain immobile in that place until he attained awakening. 

Gautama experienced a true initiatory ordeal in that position, undergoing all the terrors 
of death (as well as renewed assault by the temptations of profane life). The discipline he 
had acquired in his previous journeys served him well, however, and he was able to 
remain single-mindedly devoted to his task—to the discovery of a truth that would serve 
life, that would redeem human experience. His final temptation is perhaps the most 
interesting. The Buddha attains nirvana, perfection, as a consequence of his ordeal, and is 
offered the option of remaining in that state by the God of Death. The offer is rejected: 
Buddha returns to the world, accepting his mortal condition, so that he can disseminate 
the knowledge he has acquired. It is this latter action that truly marks him as a 
revolutionary> hero. Acquisition of wisdom—the consequence of the creative endeavor— 
is insufficient. The circle of redemptive action is not closed until information hard won 
on the battleground of the individual psyche has been integrated into the larger 
community. There can be no salvation for one in the presence of the continued suffering 
of all. It is Buddha’s return from the heaven that is in his grasp that makes him truly 
great. 

The story of the Buddha is perhaps the greatest “literary” production of the East. It is 
of great interest to note, therefore, that its theme also informs the most fundamental levels 
of Western sensibility. The Judeo-Christian tale of redemption is predicated upon 
representation of the individual subject, marred with Original Sin, fallen from grace, 
conscious of life and the borders of life, irretrievably blessed and cursed with knowledge 
of good and evil. The ability to develop such knowledge appears in the stories of Genesis 
as a “heritable characteristic of the race,” as the precondition for generation of knowledge 
of the objective boundaries of subjective existence, as the fundamental precondition of 
tragic self-awareness: 

And they were both naked, the man and his wife, and were not ashamed. 

Now the serpent was more subtil than any beast of the field which the 
Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye 
shall not eat of every tree of the garden? 

And the woman said unto the serpent. We may eat of the fruit of the 
trees of the garden: 

But of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath 
said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die. 

And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: 

For God doth know that in the day you eat thereof, then your eyes shall 
be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil. 



The Appearance of Anomaly 299 


And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it 
was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she 
took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with 
her; and he did eat. (Genesis 3:1-6) 

Myths dream ideas long before ideas take on recognizable, familiar and verbally 
comprehensible form. The myth, like the dream, may be regarded as the birthplace of 
conscious abstract knowledge, as the matrix from which formed ideas spring. Every 
concept, no matter how new or modern it appears, emerges from ground prepared by 
centuries of previous intellectual activity. Myth “prepares the ground” for explicit 
understanding by using what is presently comprehended—what has been partially 
explored, what has been adapted to in action—to represent that which remains unknown. 
Objects of experience which have been investigated can therefore come to serve as 
symbols of representation for description of the subject of experience, comparatively 
difficult to comprehend. It is in this manner that the self, which is essentially 
incomprehensible, unknown, gathers metaphoric representations. 

Things that are in themselves complex and mysterious in their attributes serve this 
metaphoric function most usefully, since their potential for symbolic application is 
virtually infinite in scope. The tree and the serpent, for example—complex objects of 
apprehension—can be understood in part through direct and active observation, and can 
therefore provide productive grist for the metaphorical mill. Tree and serpent, coupled 
and singly, have an extensive, pervasive, and detailed history as representational agents. 
They serve similar functions in a multitude of myths describing the loss of paradise, and 
must therefore serve as apt representatives of some process or structure playing a central 
part in that loss. It appears likely—despite the initial strangeness of the presumption— 
that this structure is the nervous system, 445 as such (rather than any individual nervous 
system), as it manifests itself in intrapsychic representation. 446 

The tree is the axis mundi, world-tree, grounded immovably in the maternal (or, not 
infrequently, “material”) world of chaos, with branches reaching to the sky (to heaven, to 
the realm of the ancestral spirits). According to the adepts of Hatha Yoga: 

The feet, firmly placed on the ground, correspond to the roots of the tree, 
its foundation and source of nourishment. This might indicate that in daily 
life you stand firmly on the ground to meet life’s demands. Your head is 
in space, or heaven [accented in the original]. The word “heaven” in this 
instance means in contact with life’s energy, with a wisdom beyond the 
intellect.... The spine is like the trunk of the tree, along which are located 
the various Cakras. The top of the head is the crowning blossom of this 
flowering tree, the thousand-petalled Lotus of the Sharasrara Cakra 447 

The axis mundi stands at the “center of the cosmos,” uniting three separate but 
intertwined “eternal” realms. The lower kingdom is the domain of the unknown, 
subterranean, oceanic, hellish—land of reptilian power, blind force, and eternal darkness. 
The ancient Scandinavians believed, for example—in keeping with this general 
conceptualization—that a great serpent lived underneath Yggdrasil, the world-tree, and 
gnawed at its roots, trying forever to destroy it. (Yggdrasil was constantly revivified, 



Maps of meaning 300 


however, by the springs of “magical water” that also lay underneath it). The great serpent 
is the dragon of chaos, in his destructive aspect—the source of all things (including the 
“world-tree”), as well as the power that reduces created objects to the conditions of their 
origin. (The “magical water” is the positive aspect of the unknown, with its procreative 
and rejuvenating power.) The dyad of tree and serpent is an exceedingly widespread 
motif of mythology and a common literary theme. Frye’s comments on Melville’s Moby 
Dick are relevant here. Moby Dick is a great white whale who lives in the depths of the 
sea. Ahab is the captain of a whaling boat, passionately and unreasonably dedicated to 
finally conquering that leviathan: 

In Moby Dick, Ahab’s quest for the whale may be mad or 
“monomaniacal,” as it is frequently called, or even evil so far as he 
sacrifices his crew and ship to it, but evil or revenge are not the point of 
the quest. The whale itself may be only a “dumb brute,” as the mate says, 
and even if it were malignantly determined to kill Ahab, such an attitude, 
in a whale hunted to the death, would certainly be understandable if it 
were there. What obsesses Ahab is in a dimension of reality much further 
down than any whale, in an amoral and alienating world that nothing 
normal in the human psyche can directly confront. 

The professed quest is to kill Moby Dick, but as the portents of disaster 
pile up it becomes clear that a will to identify with (not adjust to) what 
Conrad calls the destructive element is what is really driving Ahab. Ahab 
has, Melville says, become a “Prometheus,” with a vulture feeding on 
him. The axis image appears in the maelstrom or descending spiral 
(“vortex”) of the last few pages, and perhaps in a remark by one of Ahab’s 
crew: “The skewer seems loosening out of the middle of the world.” But 
the descent is not purely demonic, or simply destructive: like other 
creative descents, it is partly a quest for wisdom, however fatal the 
attaining of such wisdom may be. A relation reminiscent of Lear and the 
fool develops at the end between Ahab and the little black cabin boy Pip, 
who has been left so long to swim in the sea that he has gone insane. Of 
him it is said that he has been “carried down alive to wondrous depths, 
where strange shapes of the unwarped primal world glided to and 
fro.. .and the misermerman, Wisdom, revealed his hoarded heaps.” 

Moby Dick is as profound a treatment as modern literature affords of 
the leviathan symbolism of the Bible, the titanic-demonic force that raises 
Egypt and Babylon to greatness and then hurls them into nothingness; that 
is both an enemy of God outside the creation and, as notably in Job, a 
creature within it of whom God is rather proud. The leviathan is revealed 
to Job as the ultimate mystery of God’s ways, the “king over all the 
children of pride” (Job 41:34), of whom Satan himself is merely an 
instrument. What this power looks like depends on how it is approached. 
Approached by Conrad’s Kurtz through his Antichrist psychosis, it is an 
unimaginable horror: but it may also be a source of energy that man can 
put to his own use. There are naturally considerable risks to doing so: 
risks that Rimbaud spoke of in his celebrated lettre du voyant as a 



The Appearance of Anomaly 301 


“dereglement de tous les sens.” The phrase indicates the close connection 
between the titanic and the demonic that Verlaine expressed in his phrase 
poete maudit, the attitude of poets who feel, like Ahab, that the right 
worship of the powers they invoke is defiance. 448 

Above the lower kingdom is earth, the middle kingdom, mundane conscious existence, 
domain of man, trapped uncomfortably between the titanic and the heavenly—trapped in 
the realm where “spirit and matter” or “heaven and hell” or “order and chaos” eternally 
interact and transform. The upper kingdom, finally, is heaven, the intrapsychic ideal, 
abstract symbolic construction and utopian state, creation of generations of autonomous 
fantasy, following its own rules, governed by its own denizens, with its own non¬ 
individual transcendent existence. The fact that the axis mundi unites earth and heaven 
means that it may serve ritual purpose as a bridge between the profane individual domain 
and the “realm of the gods”: 

The symbolism of the ascension into heaven by means of a tree 
is.. .clearly illustrated by the ceremony of initiation of the Buriat shamans. 

The candidate climbs up a post in the middle of the yourt, reaches the 
summit and goes out by the smoke-hole. But we know that this opening, 
made to let out the smoke, is likened to the “hole” made by the Pole Star 
in the vault of Heaven. (Among other peoples, the tent-pole is called the 
Pillar of the Sky and is compared to the Pole-Star, which is also the hub of 
the celestial pavilion, and is named, elsewhere, the Nail of the Sky>.) Thus, 
the ritual post set up in the middle of the yourt is an image of the Cosmic 
Tree which is found at the Center of the World, with the Pole Star shining 
directly above it. By ascending it, the candidate enters into Heaven; that is 
why, as soon as he comes out of the smoke-hole of the tent he gives a loud 
cry, invoking the help of the gods: up there, he finds himself in their 

449 

presence. 

Figure 54: The World-Tree as Bridge Between “Heaven” and “Hell”* 50 offers a visual 
interpretation of the cosmic tree, connecting “heaven, earth and hell.” The cosmic tree— 
Yggdrasil, in this representation—is grounded in the domain of the dragon of chaos (the 
“serpent” who “gnaws at its roots”), passes through “earth,” and reaches up into 
“heaven,” the realm of the ancestor/gods. It was unconscious apprehension of this 
tripartite structure that led Freud, for example, to his model of the psyche: id (the 
“natural” world of dark instinctive “drive”), ego (the world of the individual), and 
superego (the gods of tradition). It is Freud’s inclusion of all the elements of the world- 
tree (negative and positive) that has given his mythology its remarkable strength, 
influence and power. 

Figure 55: The World-Tree and the Constituent Elements of Experience offers 
another interpretation and explanation of this tree, relating its “place” in the cosmos to 
the “constituent elements of experience.” This diagram suffers somewhat from its precise 
symbolic equation of the tree and the “archetypal son.” Christ and Satan, for example— 
Christian exemplars of the ambivalent son—may also be viewed as products of the tree 
(as well as particular incarnations or forms of the tree, or as phenomena otherwise

inextricably associated with the tree). The world-tree as “forbidden tree of knowledge of 
good and evil” is, for example, the cross upon which Christ, the archetypal individual, 
crucified, suspended and tormented, manifests for all eternity his identity with God; the 
tree upon which Odin, Norse savior, is likewise suspended: 


I ween that I hung 
on the windy tree 



Figure 54: The World-Tree as Bridge Between

and offered I was

may never know 

What root beneath it runs. 451 

The tree is to Christ, therefore, as Christ is to the individual (“I am the vine, ye are the 
branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for 
without me ye can do nothing.” John 15:5). Satan, by contrast, is something that lurks in 
the forbidden tree. The (devastating) wisdom he promises—the knowledge of the gods— 
is that 



Figure 55: The World-Tree and the Constituent 
Elements of Experience 

tree’s “first fruit.” This makes the world-tree the source of the revelation that destroys— 
the source of the anomalous “idea,” for example, that disrupts the static past and plunges 
it into chaos—as well as the eventual source of the revelation that redeems. 

In the book of Genesis, the fruits of the tree of knowledge are ingested in mythic 
action by the free (though sorely tempted) act of the individual. The myth uses a 
particular act, the incorporation of food, as metaphor for the assimilation of knowledge 
and ability. Erich Neumann states: 

Wherever liquor, fruit, herbs, etc., appear as the vehicles of life and 
immortality, including the “water” and “bread” of life, the sacrament of 
the Host, and every form of food cult down to the present day, we have 
[an] ancient mode of human expression before us. The materialization of 




Maps of meaning 304 


psychic contents, by which contents that we would call “psychic”—like 
life, immortality, and death—take on material form in myth and ritual and 
appear as water, bread, fruit, etc., is a characteristic of the primitive mind. 

Conscious realization is “acted out” in the elementary scheme of 
nutritive assimilation, and the ritual act of concrete eating is the first form 
of assimilation known to man.... 

The assimilation and ingestion of the “content,” the eaten food, 
produces an inner change. Transformation of the body cells through food 
intake is the most elementary of animal changes experienced by man. 

How a weary, enfeebled, and famished man can turn into an alert, strong, 
and satisfied being, or a man perishing of thirst can be refreshed or even 
transformed by an intoxicating drink: this is, and must remain, a 
fundamental experience so long as man shall exist. 452 

The act of defiant incorporation, initiating alienation from paradise and God, is instigated 
by the serpent, an ancient and dangerous creature of base matter, who can shed his skin, 
and be renewed, reborn. 

The snake serves mythology in a dual role, as agent and symbol of transformation, and 
as prime representative of fundamental, undifferentiated uroboric power. The Edenic 
serpent provides the individual with the knowledge of the gods, without their 
compensatory power and immortality. His “enlightenment” of man engenders an 
unparalleled catastrophe—a catastrophe sufficiently complete to engender not only the 
“final division of heaven and earth,” but, on that earth, a more or less permanent (and 
unfortunate) association between the promise of knowledge and the appearance of evil. 
The Edenic serpent occupies the same categorical space in the Christian psyche as 
Lucifer, “bringer of light,” spirit of “unbridled rationality”—in large part because the 
anomalous idea (the “product of rationality”) has the same potential for destruction as 
any other natural disaster. This identification is somewhat onesided, however, as the 
anomaly-inspired descent into chaos is only half the mythological story, and can also be 
viewed as a necessary precondition for emergence into a “higher state” of consciousness 
(even for the incarnation of Christ, the “second fruit of the tree of knowledge”). The 
medieval alchemists tended to adopt a gnostic interpretation of the Edenic story, for this 
reason, as Jung states: 

Hence we get the parallel of the dragon’s head with Christ, corresponding 
to the Gnostic view that the son of the highest divinity took on the form of 
the serpent in paradise in order to teach our first parents the faculty of 
discrimination, so that they should see that the work of the demiurge [the 
god who created the world in the first place] was imperfect. 45 ’ 

The Edenic serpent is, above all, the unknown (power) still lurking “inside” the nervous 
system, inside the “world-tree.” It is the innate capacity of the mind, its ability to generate 
revelatory thought, its capacity to disrupt the stable cosmos and to extend the domain of 
consciousness. It was “unconscious” (imagistic) apprehension of this idea that led 
medieval alchemy to treat the serpent as the “arcane substance” that transformed itself 
inside the tree, and to regard the serpent as the tree’s “life.” 454 



The Appearance of Anomaly 305 


It is curiosity that kills the cat but, equally, curiosity that guides the discovery. The 
forbidden or unknown object exists, shrouded in mystery, “outside” the mundane, 
familiar and explored world. The command “you can’t explore that” inevitably 
contaminates the forbidden object or situation with mystery: what could possibly be so 
dangerous (powerful, interesting) that it must be treated as if it was not there? To 
explicitly forbid something contaminates it with the “dragon of chaos”—places a serpent 
inside it, so to speak. To explicitly forbid something virtually ensures that it will attract 
attention, at least (as the unknown inevitably compels approach, as well as fear). The 
serpent/dragon-chaos/forbidden object connection can therefore be profitably viewed 
from a more “physiological” perspective, as well. The snake is regarded as the regulator 
of conscious intensity, by the adepts of Kundalini Yoga. This snake is a creature of the 
spine, a storehouse of intrapsychic energy, whose activation leads to ecstasy and 
enlightenment. The goal of Kundalini Yoga is to “awaken” this serpent, and to thereby 
reach enlightenment. 

The snake shares obvious—and subtle—features with the spine. First is the shape; 
second is shared evolutionary history. The human nervous system is composed in part of 
structures as phylogenetically ancient as the reptile, in whose recesses lurk tremendous 
excitatory power. The deep structures of the brainstem—the “head” of the spinal snake— 
perform activities upon which maintenance of consciousness absolutely depends. 455 An 
individual, lost in sleep (in “unconsciousness”) can be brought instantaneously awake and 
alert by stimulated operation of these structures, in a situation (for example) where 
something unexpected and potentially dangerous occurs. A sleeping mother can be 
brought instantly awake and motivated for exploration by the unexpected cry of her baby, 
for example. The process of contrast between desire and current status (between ideal 
future and present) does not disappear even in sleep. The unknown brings wakefulness to 
the sleeping. Threat—more generally, the appearance of the unknown—propels active 
exploration, designed to expand adaptive competence (or, terrified cessation of activity) 
and produces dramatic heightening of interest and consciousness. This means that 
consciousness as a phenomena depends in large part on activation of the ancient circuitry 
designed for response to the unknown. As the human brain evolved, much more “territory 
for activation” developed; nonetheless, alertness still depends on very archaic nervous 
system substructures. Knowledge of this dependence echoes through myth and literature. 
Goethe’s Mephistopheles is therefore able to state, for example: 

Follow the adage of my cousin Snake 

From dreams of god-like knowledge you will wake 

To fear, in which your very soul shall quake. 456 

The most “conscious” animal is the most motivated animal. The most motivated animal 
lives in apprehension of the ever-present possibility of the greatest possible threat (that of 
its own demise) and in eternal desire for rectification of this threat—in hope, in 
consideration of the possibilities of the dangerous unknown for generation of 
“redemptive” information. It is clear apprehension of the mortal danger and infinite 
possibility lurking everywhere that has boosted human consciousness far beyond that of 
its nearest kin, in a process that extended over eons. We can see the unknown in 
everything, as a consequence of our elaborate cognitive systems: worse (better)—we can 



Maps of meaning 306 


see mortal danger in everything unknown. This makes us anxious, certainly—but also (if 
we don’t run away) awake. The “serpent” of the “external unknown” works in concert, 
therefore, with the “serpent” of the internal unknown: apprehension of the mystery which 
transcends the current realm of adaptation (that is, the permanent mystery of mortal 
limitation) products permanent consciousness, at least in principle. It is for this reason 
that the Buddha is the “awakened one.” Our expanding brain, “designed” to produce 
adaptation, instead sees risk and opportunity everywhere. The circuitry “designed” to 
explore anomaly, and then to cease its actions, once exploration has produced its desired 
consequences, is instead always operating—as it can never reach its ever-receding goal. 
And so we are forever unsettled, unhappy, unsatisfied, terrified, hopeful—and awake. 

Individual incorporation of socially predicated knowledge—expanded exponentially in 
scope during the course of centuries of human cultural endeavor, culminating in 
development of an elaborated self-model —produced within the individual clear 
apprehension of mortality as a defining feature of human existence. This act of self- 
definition inextricably associated every aspect of human experience with threat— 
eternally contaminated all human experience with the intimation of mortality, with the 
hint of death, with the absolutely inexplicable unknown. This act of self-definition drove 
us to consider the world we had built as forever insufficient, forever lacking in security; 
drove us to regard the unknown “place of death,” in addition, as simultaneous eternal 
source of new redemptive information. This contamination rendered every object, every 
facet of experience, permanently mysterious, and sufficiently motivating to maintain 
heightened consciousness, as an interminable, awful and beneficial feature of human 
existence. 

The myth of the Fall, Christian or Buddhist, describes the development of self- 
consciousness as voluntary, though pre-arranged, in a sense, by the gods, whose power 
remains outside human control. Lucifer, in the guise of the serpent, offers Eve the apple, 
with truly irresistible promise of expanded knowledge. Fate arranges the future Buddha’s 
introduction to old age, sickness, and death—but Gautama chose, voluntarily, to leave the 
confines of the paradise his father endeavored to render perfect. It is the expansive 
exploratory tendency of man, his innate curiosity, that is simultaneously saving grace and 
mortal error. For this reason, the stories of Genesis and of the Buddha are predicated on 
the implicit assumption that contact with the unbearable, in the course of maturation, is 
predetermined, inevitable—and desired, catastrophic but desired. Voltaire tells a story, of 
the Good Brahmin—an admirable, tragic figure—which clarifies the role of voluntarism 
(and pride) in the reach for heightened human awareness: 

“I wish I had never been born!” 

“Why so?” said I. 

“Because,” he replied, “I have been studying these forty years, and I 
find that it has been so much time lost.... I believe that I am composed of 
matter, but I have never been able to satisfy myself what it is that 
produces thought. I am even ignorant whether my understanding is a 
simple faculty like that of walking or digesting, or if I think with my head 
in the same manner as I take hold of a thing with my hands.... I talk a 
great deal, and when I have done speaking I remain confounded and 
ashamed of what I have said.” 



The Appearance of Anomaly 307 


The same day I had a conversation with an old woman, his neighbour. I 
asked her if she had ever been unhappy for not understanding how her 
soul was made? She did not even comprehend my question. She had not, 
for the briefest moment in her life, had a thought about these subjects with 
which the good Brahmin had so tormented himself. She believed in the 
bottom of her heart in the metamorphoses of Vishnu, and provided she 
could get get some of the sacred water of the Ganges in which to make her 
ablutions, she thought herself the happiest of women. Struck with the 
happiness of this poor creature, I returned to my philosopher, whom I thus 
addressed: 

“Are you not ashamed to be thus miserable when, not fifty yards from 
you, there is an old automaton who thinks of nothing and lives 
contented?” 

“You are right,” he replied. “I have said to myself a thousand times 
that I should be happy if I were but as ignorant as my old neighbour; and 
yet it is a happiness which I do not desire.” 

This reply of the Brahmin made a greater impression on me than 
anything that had passed. 457 

The shame the Brahmin feels at his own words is a consequence of his realization of their 
insufficiency, of his self-comprehended inability to address the problems of life in some 
manner that he regards as final and complete. His shame and unhappiness is, 
paradoxically, a consequence of the activities of the same process that enables him to 
seek redress—a process that is troublesome in the extreme, but so valuable that it will not 
be abandoned, once attained. The questing spirit undermines its own stability, but will not 
give up that destabilizing capacity for return to the “unconscious” source. This is, I 
suppose, part of the “pride” of man, that serves as predestiny for the fall—but is, as well, 
part of another “unconscious” apprehension: something that destroys, initially, may still 
save, in its later development, and the process that undermines may also be the same 
process that rebuilds, out of wreckage, something stronger. 

The birth of tragedy and the evolution of shame might be considered inevitable 
consequences of voluntarism itself, of the heroic exploratory tendency, diabolically 
predetermined in its unfolding, leading inexorably to development of unbearable but 
potentially redemptive (seltjconsciousness. Extension of objective knowledge to the self 
means permanent establishment of a conceptual connection between individual existence 
and certain mortality. Development of this connection means existence in endless 
conflict, as all human activity henceforth takes place in the valley of the shadow of death. 
Fate compels all members of the human race to comprehend their isolation, their 
individuality, their abject subjugation to the harsh conditions of mortal existence. 458 
Recognition of the naked self, exposed indignantly 459 to the ravages of time and the 
world, unbearable and highly motivating, condemns man and woman to toil and suffer 
for life and for death: 

And the eyes of both of them were opened, and they knew that they were 
naked, and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons. 
(Genesis 3:7) 



Maps of meaning 308 


Acquisition of this unbearable knowledge renders unquestioning acceptance of biological 
necessity impossible, and destroys all possibility of simple adherence to the paradisal 
way. Adam and Eve immediately cover themselves up—erect a protective barrier, 
symbolic of culture itself, between their vulnerable bodies and the terrible world of 
experience. This emergent fear of vulnerability—a direct consequence of the 
development of self-consciousness (no, an intrinsic aspect of self-consciousness)— 
permanently undermines capacity for faith in blind instinctual action: 

And they heard the voice of the Lord God walking in the garden in the 
cool of the day: and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence 
of the Lord God amongst the trees of the garden. 

And the Lord God called unto Adam, and said unto him. Where art 
thou? 

And he said, I heard thy voice in the garden, and I was afraid, because I 
was naked; and I hid myself. (Genesis 3:8-10) 

Paradise is the place where heaven, earth and nature still touch—the place where man, 
who lives in harmony with the animals, is still unrebellious and still “walks with God.” 
The conscious (?), but unselfconscious animal lives within the undisputed sway of natural 
processes. It cannot develop referential perspective regarding its own perceptions, 
impulses, and behaviors, because it lacks access to the experience of others. The self- 
aware individual human being, by contrast, lives in history, in an experiential field whose 
every aspect has been shaped and modified by experience communicated from extant 
personage and ancestral figure. This socially predicated historical construct appears to 
provide the basis for sophisticated self-consciousness, which is (innate) capacity for self¬ 
reference, provided with content through action of culture. Construction of self- 
consciousness requires elaboration of a self-model; extension of the notion of the 
independent other to the self; internalization of a socially determined conceptual 
representation of the self. The capacity for such objective description arose as a 
consequence of the communication of disembodied or abstracted thought from person to 
person, through processes ranging in complexity from concrete imitation to generalized 
philosophical discourse. 

The ability to communicate skill and representation makes it possible for the 
individual to internalize and formulate a complex self-representation, to conceive of him 
or herself in terms of the experience of others—that is, in terms of the experience of 
specific others, offering (and embodying) their defining opinion, and the general other, 
historical humanity. This process apparently occurs (occurred) as each person becomes 
subject not only to those unique experiences that constitute his or her own being, but to 
the experience of every other individual, transmitted imitatively, dramatically, 
linguistically. This spatially and temporally summed wealth of culturally predicated 
experience, whose cumulative breadth and depth far exceeds the productive capability of 
a single individual lifetime, must acquire tremendous intrapsychic power once 
transmitted and cortically represented, must become capable of fundamentally altering— 
restricting and extending—innate personal experience. One inevitable consequence of 
this shared perception is self-definition, development of individual self-awareness, under 
the pressure of immediate transient experience, individual past and historical opinion 



The Appearance of Anomaly 309 


regarding the nature of one’s own experience and human experience in general. The 
expansion of detailed communication allows the individual to become at least partly 
aware of his or her own “objective” nature. 

Individual intrapsychic representation of cumulative historically predicated human 
experience makes the one into the many, so to speak; makes the individual into the 
embodiment of group experience, to date. Development of moral sense, and moral 
choice, constitutes an emergent property of such incorporation of knowledge. Knowledge 
of morality, of good and evil, presupposes the presence of alternative possibilities for 
action in a given situation—means capacity for conceptualization of alternative ideals, 
toward which behavior can be devoted. The animal, guided purely by its individual, 
biologically determined perceptual and motivational structures, essentially unaltered in 
function as a consequence of summed and stored communication, develops no possibility 
for self-criticism, has no platform upon which to stand, to criticize from—has no basis for 
comparison, no expanded repertoire of adaptive behavior, no capacity for fantasizing 
about what could be and no cultural experience to flesh out that capacity. Animal 
perception and action—animal experience—has not been made subject to historically 
predicated self-conscious analysis. 

The animal, in its natural and constant environment, remains beyond (or before) good 
and evil, gripped by its biologically determined destiny, which is the will of God, from 
the mythic perspective. The human being, by contrast, with a head hill of alternative 
opinions (the abstracted residue of individual ancestral choice), can use the internalized 
or freely offered opinion of the group to criticize spontaneous manifestations of 
subjective perception and motivation—to judge, alter, or inhibit pure subjectivity itself. 
This ability allows the human being tremendous interpretive and behavioral possibility, 
freedom, but lays subjective experience, untarnished instinct, bare to insult. This 
separation of man from immersion in the natural way constitutes a remarkable 
achievement, with eternally unsettling consequences. 

The birth of tragedy and the evolution of shame might be considered emergent 
properties of self-consciousness. The idea of redemption, which compensates for self- 
conscious existential anxiety, might be considered another, higher-order emergent 
property. The tradition of the “fall from paradise” is predicated on the idea that the 
appearance of self-consciousness dramatically altered the structure of reality. The 
explicitly religious accept the notion that man and God have been tragically estranged— 
that human actions have shattered the divine order. This idea is so central to our 
worldview that it crops up everywhere—in the ease with which we can all be made to 
feel guilty, in the (often explicitly areligious) view that human existence is “foreign” to 
the “natural order” (that human activity is detrimental to the environment, that the planet 
would somehow be “better off’ with no people on it), that our species is somehow 
innately disturbed or even insane. Our constantly emerging self-reference (our constantly 
developing self-consciousness) has turned the world of experience into a tragic play: 

Unto the woman he said, I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy 
conception; in sorrow thou shaft bring forth children; 460 and thy desire 
shall be to thy husband, and he shall rule over thee. 

And unto Adam he said, Because thou has hearkened unto the voice of 
thy wife, and hast eaten of the tree, of which I commanded thee, saying. 



Maps of meaning 310 


Thou shalt not eat of it: cursed is the ground for thy sake; in sorrow shalt 
thou eat of it for all the days of thy life; 

Thoms also and thistles shall it bring forth for thee; and thou shalt eat 
the herb of the field; 

In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the 
ground; for dust thou art, and unto dust shalt thou return.” (Genesis 3:lb- 
19) 



Figure 56: Genesis and Descent 

Foreknowledge of destiny seals fate, and paradise is forever lost to man: 

And the Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know 
good and evil: and now, lest he put forth his hand, and take also of the tree 
of life, and eat, and live forever: 

Therefore the Lord God sent him forth from the garden of Eden, to till 
the ground from whence he was taken. 

So he drove out the man: and he placed at the east of the Garden of 
Eden Cherubims, and a flaming sword which turned every way, to keep 
the way of the tree of life. (Genesis 3:22-24) 

Why hide from God? Because knowledge of vulnerability makes us shrink from our own 
potential. To live, frilly, is to risk—to risk everything, to risk death. Why hide from God? 





The Appearance of Anomaly 311 


How, under such conditions, could we not hide? Survival has become terror and endless 
toil—necessitating discipline, compelled by burdensome wisdom, rife with intrapsychic 
conflict, motivated by anxiety—instead of spontaneous natural activity. We remain 
eternally hung on the cross of our own vulnerability. The creation and fall of man is 
portrayed schematically in Figure 56: Genesis and Descent . 461

THE HOSTILE BROTHERS 

Archetypes of Response to the Unknown 

The “contamination of anomaly with the threat of death,” attendant on the 
development of self-consciousness, amplifies the valence of the unknown 
to a virtually unbearable point. This unbearable amplification has 
motivated the development of two transpersonal patterns of behavior and 
schemas of representation, constituting the individual as such, embodied 
in mythology as the “hostile brothers.” One of these “hostile brothers” or 
“eternal sons of God” is the mythological hero. He faces the unknown 
with the presumption of its benevolence—with the (improvable) attitude 
that confrontation with the unknown will bring renewal and redemption. 
He enter, voluntarily, into creative “union with the Great Mother,” builds 
or regenerates society, and brings peace to a warring world. 

The other “son of God” is the eternal adversary. This “spirit of 
unbridled rationality,” horrified by his limited apprehension of the 
conditions of existence, shrinks from contact with everything he 
does not understand. This shrinking weakens his personality, no 
longer nourished by the “water of life,” and makes him rigid and 
authoritarian, as he clings desperately to the familiar, “rational,” and 
stable. Every deceitful retreat increases his fear; every new 
“protective law” increases his frustration, boredom and contempt 
for life. His weakness, in combination with his neurotic suffering, 
engenders resentment and hatred for existence itself. 

The personality of this adversary comes in two forms, so to 
speak—although these two forms are inseparably linked. The 
fascist sacrifices his soul, which would enable him to confront 
change on his own, to the group, which promises to protect him 
from everything unknown. The decadent, by contrast, refuses to 
join the social world, and clings rigidly to his own ideas—merely 
because he is too undisciplined to serve as an apprentice. The 
fascist wants to crush everything different, and then everything; the 
decadent immolates himself, and builds the fascist from his ashes. 
The bloody excesses of the twentieth century, manifest most 
evidently in the culture of the concentration camp, stand as 
testimony to the desires of the adversary and as monument to his 
power. 

The pitfalls of fascism and decadence may be avoided through 
identification with the hero, the true individual. The hero organizes 
the demands of social being and the responsibilities of his own soul 



The Hostile Brothers 313 


into a coherent, hierarchically arranged unit. He stands on the 
border between order and chaos, and serves the group as creator 
and agent of renewal. The hero’s voluntary contact with the 
unknown transforms it into something benevolent—into the eternal 
source, in fact, of strength and ability. Development of such 
strength—attendant upon faith in the conditions of experience— 
enables him to stand outside the group, when necessary, and to 
use it as a tool, rather than as armor. The hero rejects identification 
with the group as the ideal of life, preferring to follow the dictates of 
his conscience and his heart. His identification with meaning—and 
his refusal to sacrifice meaning for security—renders existence 
acceptable, despite its tragedy. 


INTRODUCTION: THE HERO AND THE ADVERSARY 

The culture bequeathed to us by our forebears degenerates of its own 
accord, as the flux of the present invalidates the static presuppositions of 
the past. We may speed this process of degeneration by our “sins”—by 
voluntary refusal to attend to our errors, when they manifest themselves, 
and by failure to adjust behaviors and attitudes, in consequence. Through 
such refusal and failure, we transform the irritations of the present into the 
catastrophes of the future, and invite a wrathful God to drown us beneath 
the waves. 

As has been well known since the compilations made by R.Andree, 
H.Usener, and J.G.Frazer, the deluge myth is almost universally dis 
seminated; it is documented in all the continents (although very 
rarely in Africa) and on various cultural levels. A certain number of 
variants seem to be the result of dissemination, first from Mesopo 
tamia and then from India. It is equally possible that one or several 
diluvial catastrophes gave rise to fabulous narratives. But it would be 
risky to explain so widespread a myth by phenomena of which no 
geological traces have been found. The majority of the flood myths 
seem in some sense to form part of the cosmic rhythm: the old 
world, peopled by a fallen humanity, is submerged under the waters, 
and some time later a new world emerges from the aquatic “chaos.” 

In a large number of variants, the flood is the result of the sins (or 
ritual faults) of human beings: sometimes it results simply from the 
wish of a divine being to put an end to mankind.. .the chief causes 
lie at once in the sins of men and the decrepitude of the world. By the 
mere fact that it exists—that is, that it lives and produces —the cosmos 
gradually deteriorates and ends by falling into decay. This is the rea 
son why it has to be recreated. In other words, the flood realizes, on 
the macrocosmic scale, what is symbolically effected during the New 



Maps of meaning 314 


Year festival: the “end of the world” and the end of a sinful humanity 
in order to make a new creation possible. 462 

No discussion of the architecture of belief can possibly be considered complete, in the 
absence of reference to evil. Evil is no longer a popular word, so to speak—the term is 
generally considered old-fashioned, not applicable in a society that has theoretically 
dispensed with its religious preoccupations. Acts once defined as evil are now merely 
considered the consequence of unjust familial, social or economic structures (although 
this view is not as widespread as it once was). Alternatively, the commission of 
incomprehensible acts of cruelty and destruction are viewed as symptomatic of some 
physiological weakness or disease. Seldom are acts of evil considered voluntary or 
purposeful—committed by someone possessed by an aesthetic that makes art of terror 
and pain. 

In the Egyptian cosmology, Osiris, the king, mythic image of the known, the Great 
Father, has an eternal evil twin and opposite, Seth, who eventually leads Osiris to his 
death. Four thousand years later, the moral of this great story has not yet been grasped: 
failure to understand the nature of evil leads to its eventual victory. At the end of this, the 
most cruel and bloodthirsty of centuries, we are in danger not only of failing to 
understand evil, but of denying its very existence. Invisibility, however, is what the devil 
craves most. 

I have spent a substantial amount of time, up to this point, describing the nature of 
culture, and the manner in which it is generated. Culture, the Great Father, protects us 
from the terrors of the unknown; defines around us a sacred space into which nothing 
unbearably foreign is allowed. Culture is generated by the process whose essential 
features have been captured in the pervasive and recurrent myths of the hero. This hero is 
the individual who voluntarily faces the dragon of the unknown, cuts it up, and creates 
the world from its pieces; the individual who overcomes the too-long-senescent tyrant 
and frees the virgin mother from his grasp. Such myths present a world starkly 
ambivalent in its nature: the “natural” world is endlessly creative, and equally 
destructive; the inextricably associated social “environment” is simultaneously tyrannical 
and protective. So far in our discussion, however, the hero has stood alone. This means 
that our story is far from over. The essential ambivalence characterizing the “constituent 
elements of experience” extends to the individual as well, who is capable of thoughts and 
actions as dark and destructive as anything in society or nature. 

Mythology envelops the transpersonal capacity for evil characterizing the individual, 
as such, in the guise of a personality, duplicating its encapsulation of chaos and order. 
The dark side of the individual is the absolute adversary of the hero; the personality who 
shrinks from contact with the unknown, or who denies that it exists, instead of actively 
approaching and exploring; the personality whose “advice” speeds the decline of society 
rather than its renewal. The image of this personality—like the phenomenon itself—has 
developed and become elaborated in complexity and sophistication over the course of 
centuries: proper understanding of its nature is terrifying, in a salutary sort of way. This 
informative terror is the “purpose” of encapsulation in narrative, in transpersonal 
memory: the image of the Christian devil, for example, is the best “bad example” 
available. His implicit or explicit imitation leads to disaster; the stories that portray his 



The Hostile Brothers 315 


central features exist as object lessons in the consequences of resentment, hatred, 
totalitarian arrogance and jealousy. 

Evil, like good, is not something static: it does not merely mean breaking the rules, for 
example, and is not simply aggression, anger, force, pain, disappointment, anxiety or 
horror. Life is of course endlessly complicated by the fact that what is bad in one 
circumstance is positively necessary in the next. I noted previously 463 that the answer to 
the question “what is the good?” must in fact be sought in the meta-domain, so to speak: 
the more fundamental mystery—given the context-dependent nature of “the good”—is 
“how are answers to the question ‘what is the good?’ endlessly and appropriately 
generated?” The “good,” then, becomes the set of circumstances that allow the process of 
moral construction to flourish or becomes the process of moral construction itself. The 
problem “what then is evil?” must be addressed similarly. 

Evil is rejection of and sworn opposition to the process of creative exploration. Evil is 
proud repudiation of the unknown, and willful failure to understand, transcend and 
transform the social world. Evil is, in addition—and in consequence—hatred of the 
virtuous and courageous, precisely on account of their virtue and courage. Evil is the 
desire to disseminate darkness, for the love of darkness, where there could be light. The 
spirit of evil underlies all actions that speed along the decrepitude of the world, that foster 
God’s desire to inundate and destroy everything that exists. 

Great evils are easily identifiable, at least in retrospect, and are usually the result (at 
least in interpretation) of the act of another. We build endless memorials to the 
Holocaust, for example, and swear never to forget. But what is it that we are 
remembering? What is the lesson we are supposed to have learned? We don’t know how 
the Holocaust came about—don’t know what it is that the people involved did, or failed 
to do, step by step, that made them behave in such an appalling manner; don’t know what 
or who made German society take such a terrible turn. How could Hitler fail to believe 
that he was correct, when everyone around him bowed to his orders? Would it not take 
character of exceptional magnitude to resist the temptation of absolute power, freely 
offered, democratically granted—even insisted upon? How would it be possible for 
anyone to remain properly humble under such conditions? Most of us have personal 
frailties that remain constrained by our social environments. Our neurotic tendencies are 
checked by the people around us, who care for us, who complain and protest when we 
lose our self-control and take things, in our weakness, one step too far. If everyone 
around thinks you are the savior, who is left to point out your defects and keep you 
conscious of them? This is not an apology for Hitler, merely recognition that he was all 
too human. And what does that statement mean? Hitler was human; Stalin, too; Idi Amin, 
too. What does that say about being human? 

Our tyrannical tendencies and moral decadences generally find their expression 
limited by our narrow domains of personal power. We cannot doom millions to death, at 
a whim, because we do not have the resources to do so. We satisfy ourselves, in the 
absence of such power, with riding roughshod over those near to us—and congratulate 
ourselves on our moral virtue. We use aggression and strength to bend dependent others 
to our will—or, in the absence of strength, use sickness and weakness to harness the force 
of empathy, and deceive our way to dominance, underground. Granted the opportunity, 
how many of us would not be Hitlers? Assuming we had the ambition, dedication and 



Maps of meaning 316 


power of organization—which is highly unlikely. Paucity of skill, however, does not 
constitute moral virtue. 

Many kings are tyrants, or moral decadents, because they are people —and many 
people are tyrants, or moral decadents. We cannot say “never again” as a consequence of 
the memory of the Holocaust, because we do not understand the Holocaust, and it is 
impossible to remember what has not been understood. We do not understand the 
Holocaust because we do not comprehend ourselves. Human beings, very much like 
ourselves, produced the moral catastrophes of the Second World War (and of Stalin’s 
Soviet Union, and of Pol Pot’s Cambodia...). “Never forget” means “know thyself’: 
recognize and understand that evil twin, that mortal enemy, who is part and parcel of 
every individual. 

The heroic tendency—the archetypal savior—is an eternal spirit, which is to say, a 
central and permanent aspect of human being. The same is true, precisely, of the 
“adversarial” tendency: the capacity for endless denial, and the desire to make everything 
suffer for the outrage of its existence, is an ineradicable intrapsychic element of the 
individual. The great dramatists and religious thinkers of the world have been able to 
grasp this fact, at least implicitly, and to transmit it in story and image; modern analytic 
thinkers and existential theorists have attempted to abstract these ideas upward into 
“higher consciousness,” and to present them in logical and purely semantic form. 
Sufficient material has been gathered to present a compelling portrait of evil. 


THE ADVERSARY: EMERGENCE, DEVELOPMENT AND 
REPRESENTATION 

The figure of Satan is arguably the most well-developed representation of 
evil extant in religious and mythological thought. Although it is tempting 
to identity this “personage” with particular personality attributes, such as 
aggression—or with the differences of the stranger—it is more realistic to 
view him as the embodiment of a personal and social process. The devil is 
the spirit who underlies the development of totalitarianism; the spirit who 
is characterized by rigid ideological belief (by the “predominance of the 
rational mind”), by reliance on the lie as a mode of adaptation (by refusal 
to admit to the existence of error, or to appreciate the necessity of 
deviance), and by the inevitable development of hatred for the self and 
world. Each of these characteristics is intrinsically and causally related to 
the others; they are linked inextricably together, and can be aptly 
conceptualized as a transpersonal and eternal personality. 

The devil is willful rejection of the process that makes life 
bearable, out of spite for the tragic conditions of existence. This 
rejection is intellectually arrogant, because the “conditions” are 
interpreted—which is to say: development of self-consciousness 
tainted everything with death, but self-consciousness is contained 
within a global understanding that is still exceptionally limited in its 
scope. The present, as currently interpreted, is indeed the 
unbearable present: but that interpretation may change, if the 




The Hostile Brothers 317 


possibility for change is not disallowed, as a consequence of 
absolutist belief, conceit and resentment. 

The devil works to eliminate the world, as something whose 
weakness and vulnerability makes it contemptible. He has 
produced dreadful suffering in the twentieth century—not least 
among cultures who have dispensed with his image. We are 
fortunate to have survived without an irreversible tragedy. Our luck 
to date should not blind us to the dangers of continued ignorance, 
or to the necessity of bringing our poorly comprehended selves 
under control. Every technological advance we make increases our 
power; every increase in power makes our internal integration and 
expanded self-consciousness that much more necessary. 

The noble soul has reverence for itself. 464 

As I looked deeper into the problem of evil over the last fourteen years, I found myself 
increasingly and involuntarily fascinated with the myth of Satan, and curious about the 
position of this story in Western thought. The idea of the devil has exerted a powerful 
influence on the development of Christianity and Christian culture—and, therefore, on 
Western and world society—although there is little direct reference to Satan in the Old 
and New Testaments (surprisingly little: no description of hell, to speak of, limited and 
oblique reference to the rebellion of the angels and the war in heaven preceding the 
establishment of hell; nothing of any consequence regarding the terrible afterlife that 
theoretically awaits all sinners). 

It is my understanding that traditional and literary representations of Satan, the ruling 
angel of hell, constitute true mythology’. These ideas surround the established central 
writings and ideas of Christianity like fog surrounds a mountain. They have been 
transmitted to us, in part, as religious doctrine; in part, as oral tradition; in part, because 
of the efforts of Dante and Milton. I had a very limited religious education, in my youth, 
and all I ever knew about the devil was “hearsay”—bits and pieces I picked up while 
reading other material (such as Joyce’s Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, which 
contains a terrifying Jesuit sermon on the wages of sin). All I knew was the outline of the 
story codified by Milton: Satan, the highest angel in God’s heavenly hierarchy, desired to 
become like the Most High, and fostered a rebellion in heaven. He was defeated, and 
cast, unrepentant, into Hell, where he rules eternally over the spirits of the sinful dead. I 
had no real idea what this story meant, although it was obvious to me that these 
characters and events could have never “really” existed. 

I learned later that the association made between the serpent in Eden and the devil was 
essentially speculative. Indeed, certain Gnostics had even posited that the deity who 
brought Adam and Eve to the light of self-consciousness was a higher spirit than the 
unconscious demiurge who had created everything in the beginning. This idea was 
predicated upon Gnostic “recognition” that a fall from paradise—from a previous “plane 
of stability”—often comprised the necessary precondition for movement to a “higher 
place.” Traditional medieval Christians developed a similar idea. For them, Original Sin 
was a “fortunate error” that made necessary the incarnation of Christ. This meant that the 
Christian fall, although tragic in and of itself, could be regarded as positively beneficial. 



Maps of meaning 318 


since it brought about the redemptive incarnation of God (which was the most stupendous 
event in history, from the Christian perspective). Adoption of this broader viewpoint 
allowed even the Edenic serpent, who propelled mankind into chaos, to be interpreted as 
a “tool of God”—as a tool of the beneficial God who is endlessly working to bring about 
the perfection of the world, despite the troublesome existence of free choice and demonic 
temptation. (The name Lucifer means “bringer of light,” after all.) I also knew, more or 
less “unconsciously,” that the devil has been long associated with the power and 
arrogance of rational thought (in Goethe’s Faust, for example). This association has 
enabled the dogmatic forces of the church to adopt an antiscientific stance, frequently— 
science rationality devil—and to justify unfortunate church opposition to emergent 
truth. However, a mythological idea is not invalidated as an idea in consequence of its 
misapplication. The capacity for rational thought is a dangerous force, without doubt, 
because it is a powerful force—and the conditions under which thinking plays a purely 
destructive role are still not well comprehended. 

This plethora of vaguely related ideas and stories kept entering and re-entering my 
mind, most frequently in combination with remembrance of a telling symbolic historic 
act: the transformation of the Notre Dame Cathedral into the “Temple of Reason,” in the 
midst of the terrors of the French Revolution. It is no easy matter to come to a clear 
understanding of such notions, to grasp their nature logically or emotionally, or even to 
determine how they could possibly be related. After all, we tend to regard the 
development of “clear understanding” as equivalent to the construction of a “proper set” 
and assume that the reality of a thing can be clearly defined. Ideas about evil, however, 
do not form a “proper set.” They form a “natural category,” containing diverse material— 
just like ideas about the “known” or the “unknown.” To complicate things further, evil, 
like good, is not something static (although it may align itself with all that is stubbornly 
static). It is rather a dynamic process, a spirit that partakes of the motivational or affective 
states of pride, resentment, jealousy and hatred but cannot be identified unerringly with 
the presence of any or all. The morality of an aggressive act, for example, depends on the 
nature of the context in which it is manifested, just as the meaning of a given word is 
defined by the sentence, the paragraph—even the book or culture—in which it appears. 
Evil is a living complex. Its nature can be most clearly comprehended through 
examination of the “personality” it has “adopted” in mythology, literature and fantasy, 
elaborated in the lengthy course of historical development. This personality consists of 
those “meta”-attributes of evil that have remained stable over time despite dramatic shifts 
in the particulars of human existence and human morality. 

The image of the devil is the form that the idea of evil has taken, for better or worse, at 
least in the West. We have not yet developed an explicit model of evil that would allow 
us to forget, transcend or otherwise dispense with this mythological representation. We 
rationalize our lack of such understanding by presuming that the very notion of evil is 
archaic. This is a truly ridiculous presumption, in this century of indescribable horror. In 
our ignorance and complacency, we deride ancient stories about the nature of evil, 
equating them half-consciously with childish things best put away. This is an exceedingly 
arrogant position. There is no evidence whatsoever that we understand the nature of evil 
any better than our forebears, despite our psychology, even though our expanded 
technological power has made us much more dangerous when we are possessed. Our 
ancestors were at least constantly concerned with the problem of evil. Acceptance of the 



The Hostile Brothers 319 


harsh Christian dogma of Original Sin, for example (despite its pessimism and apparent 
inequity) at least meant recognition of evil, such dogma at least promoted some 
consideration of the tendency toward evil as an intrinsic, heritable aspect of human 
nature. From the perspective informed by belief in Original Sin, individual actions and 
motivations must always be carefully scrutinized and considered, even when apparently 
benevolent, lest the ever-present adversarial tendencies “accidentally” gain the upper 
hand. The dogma of Original Sin forces every individual to regard himself as the 
(potential) immediate source of evil and to locate the terrible underworld of mythology 
and its denizens in intrapsychic space. It is no wonder that this idea has become 
unpopular: nonetheless, evil exists somewhere. It remains difficult not to see hypocrisy in 
the souls of those who wish to localize it somewhere else. 

Once I understood these things in a provisional sort of way, the ancient ideas began to 
sort themselves out. I learned from Eliade how to make sense out of the notion of a 
“heavenly hierarchy.” The monotheism of Judaism and Christianity has its roots in older, 
more polytheistic thinking. The many gods of archaic conceptualization became the 
single ruler of more modern religious thinking as a consequence of spiritual 
competition—so to speak. This competition is the battle of ideas with implication for 
action—fought in abstraction, image and in the course of genuine earthly combat— 
portrayed in mythology as spiritual war, played out in heaven (which is the place where 
transpersonal ideas exist). The deity who came to prevail over all is One God, with a 
complex set of attributes, “surrounded” by a panoply of angels and divine “echoes” of 
previous gods (who represent those transpersonal and eternal psychological processes 
rendered subordinate in the course of the spiritual phylogenesis of man). 

Christian mythology portrays Satan as the “highest angel” in God’s “heavenly 
kingdom.” This fact renders his association with reason more comprehensible. Reason 
may well be considered the “highest angel”—which is to say, the most developed and 
remarkable psychological or spiritual faculty, characteristic of all men (and therefore, 
something transpersonal and eternal). Figure 57: The Devil as Aerial Spirit and Ungodly 
Intellect portrays Eugene Delacroix’s imagistic interpretation, an illustration for Part One 
of Faust. 41 ' Reason, the most exceptional of spirits, suffers from the greatest of 
temptations: reason’s own capacity for self-recognition and self-admiration means 
endless capacity for pride, which is the act of presuming omniscience. It is reason’s 
remarkable ability and its own recognition of that ability that leads it to believe it 
possesses absolute knowledge and can therefore replace, or do without, God: 

He trusted to have equalled the Most High, 

If he opposed, and with ambitious aim 

Against the throne and monarchy of God, 

Raised impious war in Heaven. 466 

It is reason’s belief in its own omniscience—manifest in procedure and image, if not in 
word—that “unconsciously” underlies totalitarianism in its many destructive guises. Frye 
notes: 



Maps of meaning 320 



Figure 57: The Devil as Aerial Spirit and Ungodly 
Intellect 

A demonic fall, as Milton presents it, involves defiance of and rivalry 
with God rather than simple disobedience, and hence the demonic society 
is a sustained and systematic parody of the divine one, associated with 
devils or fallen angels because it seems far beyond normal human 
capacities in its powers. We read of ascending and descending angels on 
Jacob’s and Plato’s ladders, and similarly there seem to be demonic 
reinforcements in heathen life that account for the almost superhuman 
grandeur of the heathen empires, especially just before they fall. 

Two particularly notable passages in the Old Testament prophets 
linked to this theme are the denunciation of Babylon in Isaiah 14 and of 
Tyre in Ezekiel 28. Babylon is associated with Lucifer the morning star, 


The Hostile Brothers 321 


who said to himself: “I will be like the Most High”; Tyre is identified with 
a “Covering Cherub,” a splendid creature living in the garden of Eden “till 
the day that iniquity was found in thee.” In the New Testament (Luke 
10:18) Jesus speaks of Satan as falling from heaven, hence Satan’s 
traditional identification with Isaiah’s Lucifer and his growth in legend 
into the great adversary of God, once the prince of the angels, and, before 
being displaced, the firstborn son of God. The superhuman demonic force 
behind the heathen kingdoms is called in Christianity the Antichrist, the 
earthly ruler demanding divine honors. 467 

It is not that easy to understand why the act of presuming omniscience is reasonably 
construed as precisely opposite to the act of creative exploration (as the adversary is 
opposite to the hero). What “knowing everything” means, however—at least in 
practice—is that the unknown no longer exists, and that frirther exploration has therefore 
been rendered superfluous (even treacherous). This means that absolute identification 
with the “known” necessarily comes to replace all opportunity for identification with the 
process that comes to know. The presumption of absolute knowledge, which is the 
cardinal sin of the rational spirit, is therefore prima facie equivalent to rejection of the 
hero—to rejection of Christ, of the Word of God, of the (divine) process that mediates 
between order and chaos. The arrogance of the totalitarian stance is ineradicably opposed 
to the “humility” of creative exploration. [Humility’ —it is only constant admission of 
error and capacity for error (admission of “sinful and ignorant nature”) that allows for 
recognition of the unknown, and then for update of knowledge and adaptation in 
behavior. Such humility is, somewhat paradoxically, courageous—as admission of error 
and possibility for error constitutes the necessary precondition for confrontation with the 
unknown. This makes genuine cowardice the “underground” motivation for the 
totalitarian presumption: the true authoritarian wants everything unpredictable to vanish. 
The authoritarian protects himself from knowledge of this cowardice by a show of 
patriotic advocacy, often at apparent cost to himself.] 

In the fifth book of Paradise Lost, which Milton constructed from Biblical and 
mythological allusions, Lucifer is “passed over” by God in honor of the “second son,” 
Christ. 468 This “shift in the dominance hierarchy of heaven” seems to me to indicate that 
reason (which, in consequence of its self-recognition as the “highest angel” of God, 
believes itself capable of single-handedly engendering redemption) must remain 
subordinate to the processes of the exploratory hero. Reason can serve health only when 
it plays a secondary’ role. The option of ruling in hell, rather than serving in heaven, 
nonetheless appears as an attractive alternative to the rational mind, under a wide variety 
of circumstances. 

The devil is the spirit who eternally states, “all that I know is all that there is to be 
known”; the spirit who falls in love with his own beautiful productions and, in 
consequence, can no longer see beyond them. The devil is the desire to be right, above 
all, to be right once and for all and finally, rather than to constantly admit to insufficiency 
and ignorance, and to therefore partake in the process of creation itself. The devil is the 
spirit which endlessly denies, because it is afraid, in the final analysis, afraid and weak. 

It is lack of discrimination between the existence of the adversary as process with the 
existence of anomaly as constituent element of experience that has led to some of the 



Maps of meaning 322 


worst excesses of Christianity (and not just Christianity). It has constantly been the case 
that “proper-thinking” people contuse the existence of threats to their security and moral 
integrity with evil. This means that the proper-thinking confuse the being of the genius 
and the stranger, who offer up experience that exists in contrast with established belief, 
with the process of rejection of such experience. This lack of discrimination is both 
comprehensible and motivated: comprehensible, because the strange/stranger/strange 
idea/revolutionary hero upsets the applecart and produces affective dysregulation (which 
is the state most devoutly desired by the devil); motivated, because categorizing anomaly 
with evil allows for its “justified” repression. The heroic act of updating current morality, 
however—through the promotion of uncomfortable contact with the unknown—creates 
chaos only in the service of higher order. To repress that process and cling “patriotically” 
to tradition is to ensure that tradition will collapse precipitously—and far more 
dangerously—at some point in the not-too-distant future. 

The fact of my lascivious or aggressive fantasy—to take a specific example of things 
generally regarded in a dim light—is not evil, if I am a devout Christian: evil is the act of 
denying that such fantasy exists (or, perhaps, the act of realizing that fantasy, without 
consideration of its proper place). The fantasy itself merely constitutes information 
(unacceptable information, to be sure, from the current, merely provisional standpoint: 
but information with the capacity to transform, if admitted). The existence of the Muslim, 
and the Muslim viewpoint, likewise is not evil, if I am a devout Christian. Evil is instead 
my presumption of personal omniscience—my certainty that I understand my Christian 
belief well enough to presume its necessary opposition to the stranger and his ideas; my 
certainty that identification with a static “comprehended” moral structure is sufficient to 
guarantee my integrity—and my consequent ignorant and self-righteous persecution of 
the Muslim. The devil is not the uncomfortable fact but the act of shrinking from that 
fact. The weaknesses, stupidities, laxities and ignorances that ineradicably constitute the 
individual are not evil in and of themselves. These “insufficiencies” are a necessary 
consequence of the limitations that make experience possible. It is the act of denying that 
stupidity exists, once it has manifested itself, that is evil, because stupidity cannot then be 
overcome. Such denial brings spiritual progress to a halt. Consciousness of ignorance and 
cupidity manifests itself in shame, anxiety and pain—in the guise of the visitor whose 
arrival is most feared—and such consciousness may consequently come to be considered 
the embodiment of evil itself. But it is the bearer of bad news who brings us closer to the 
light, if the significance of the news is allowed to manifest itself. 

Elaine Pagels has recently written a book. The Origin of Satan, 469 in which she 
describes how the idea of the devil as the eternal enemy of Christ enabled those who 
profess Christianity to persecute those who do not. The presuppositions of the persecutor 
are, for example: “the devil is the enemy, the Jew is not a Christian—the Jew is an 
enemy, the Jew is the devil.” Pagels presents the not unreasonable and justifiably popular 
hypothesis that the invention of Satan was motivated by desire to transform the act of 
persecuting others into a moral virtue. It appears, however, that the historical 
“developmental path” of the “idea of the adversary” is somewhat more complex. 
Transpersonal notions of the breadth of the “image of the Devil” cannot emerge as a 
consequence of conscious motivation, because their development requires many centuries 
of transgenerational work (which cannot be easily “organized”). The image of the devil, 
although endlessly applied to rationalize the subjugation of others (as all great ideas can 



The Hostile Brothers 323 


be subverted) emerged as a consequence of endless geniune attempts to encapsulate the 
“personality” of evil. The logic that associates the other with the devil works only for 
those who think that religion means belief—that is, identification with a set of static and 
often unreasonable “facts”—and not action, meta-imitation, or the incarnation of the 
creative process in behavior. The existence of the anomalous fact, properly considered— 
the uncomfortable fact, embodied in the stranger or rendered abstract in the form of 
differing philosophy—is a call to religions action, and not an evil. 

It has taken mankind thousands of years of work to develop dawning awareness of the 
nature of evil—to produce a detailed dramatic representation of the process that makes up 
the core of human maladaptation and voluntarily produced misery. It seems premature to 
throw away the fruit of that labor or to presume that it is something other than what it 
appears before we understand what it signifies. Consciousness of evil emerged first as 
ritual enactment, then as dynamic image, expressed in myth. This representation covers a 
broad spatial and temporal territory, whose examination helps flesh out understanding of 
the personality of the adversary. The most thoroughly developed archaic personification 
of evil can perhaps be found in the ideas of Zoroastrianism, which flourished in relatively 
explicit form from 1000-600 B.C. (and which undoubtedly depended for its form on 
much more ancient, less explicit “ideas”). The Zoroastrians developed a number of ideas 
which were later incorporated into Christianity, including “the myth of the savior; the 
elaboration of an optimistic eschatology, proclaiming the final triumph of Good and 
universal salvation; [and] the doctrine of the resurrection of bodies.” 470 

Zarathustra, the mythic founder of Zoroastrianism, was a follower of Ahura Mazda 
(the central deity in this essentially monotheistic religion). Ahura (“sky”) Mazda was 
surrounded by a pantheon of divine entities —the Amesha Spentas, analogous to angels— 
who were very evidently psychological in their nature (at least from the modern 
perspective). 471 These “spirits” include Asha (justice), Vohu Manah (good thought), 
Armaiti (devotion), Xshathra (power), Haurvatdt (integrity) and Ameretdt (immortality). 
Ahura Mazda was also the father of twin “brothers,” spirits—Spenta Mainyu (the 
beneficient spirit) and Angra Mainyu (the destroying spirit). Eliade states: 

In the beginning, it is stated in a famous gdthd (Yasna 30, authored by 
Zarathustra), these two spirits chose, one of them good and life, the other 
evil and death. Spenta Mainyu declares, at the “beginning of existence,” to 
the Destroying Spirit: “Neither our thoughts nor our doctrines, nor our 
mental powers; neither our choices, nor our words, nor our acts; neither 
our consciences nor our souls are in agreement.” This shows that the two 
spirits—the one holy, the other wicked—differ rather by choice than by 
nature. 

Zarathustra’s theology is not dualistic in the strict sense of the term, 
since Ahura Mazda is not confronted by an anti-God; in the beginning, the 
opposition breaks out between the two Spirits. On the other hand, the 
unity between Ahura Mazda and the Holy [Good] Spirit is several times 
implied (see Yasna 43.3, etc.). In short, Good and Evil, the holy one and 
the destroying demon, proceed from Ahura Mazda; but since Angra 
Mainyu freely chose his mode of being and his malificient vocation, the 
Wise Lord cannot be considered responsible for the appearance of Evil. 



Maps of meaning 324 


On the other hand, Ahura Mazda, in his omniscience, knew from the 
beginning what choice the Destroying Spirit would make and nevertheless 
did not prevent it; this may mean either that God transcends all kinds of 
contradictions or that the existence of evil constitutes the preliminary 
condition for human freedom. 472 

The mythic “hostile brothers”—Spenta Mainyu and Angra Mainyu, Osiris and Seth, 
Gilgamesh and Enkidu, Cain and Abel, Christ and Satan—are representative of two 
eternal individual tendencies, twin “sons of god,” heroic and adversarial. The former 
tendency, the archetypal savior, is the everlasting spirit of creation and transformation, 
characterized eternally by the capacity to admit to the unknown and, therefore, to 
progress toward “the kingdom of heaven.” The eternal adversary, by contrast, is 
incarnation in practice, imagination and philosophy of the spirit of denial, eternal 
rejection of the “redeeming unknown,” and the adoption of rigid self-identification. 
Myths of the “hostile brothers”—like those of the Zoroastrians—tend to emphasize the 
role of free choice in determination of essential mode of being. Christ, for example (and 
Gautama Buddha) are tempted constantly and potently toward evil, but choose to reject it. 
Angra Mainyu and Satan accept evil, by contrast, and revel in it (despite evidence that it 
produces their own suffering). The choice of these spirits cannot be reduced to some 
more essential aspect, such as the particular conditions of existence (which are identical, 
anyway, for both “beings”) or the vagaries of intrinsic nature. It is voluntary willingness 
to do what is known to be wrong, despite the capacity to understand and avoid such 
action, that most particularly characterizes evil—the evil of spirit and man. So Milton’s 
God can comment, on the degeneration of Satan and mankind: 

So will fall 

Hee and his faithless progeny: whose fault? 

Whose but his own? ingrate, he had of mee 
All he could have; I made him just and right, 
sufficient to have stood, though free to fall. 47 ’ 

Refusal of the good is, I think, most effectively and frequently justified by reference to 
the terrible affective consequences of (self) consciousness. This means that 
comprehension of the vulnerability and mortality of man, and the suffering associated 
with that vulnerability—apprehension of the ultimate cruelty and pointlessness of life— 
may be used as rationale for evil. Life is terrible, and appears, at some moments, 
ultimately terrible: unfair, irrational, painful and meaningless. Interpreted in such a light, 
existence itself may well appear as something reasonably eradicated. Goethe’s 
Mephistopheles, “prince of lies,” defines his philosophy, in consequence, in the following 
terms (in Part One of Faust): 

The spirit I, that endlessly denies. 

And rightly, too; for all that comes to birth 
Is fit for overthrow, as nothing worth; 

Wherefore the world were better sterilized; 

Thus all that’s here as Evil recognized 



The Hostile Brothers 325 


Is gain to me, and downfall, ruin, sin 
The very element I prosper in. 474 

He repeats this credo, in slightly elaborated form, in Part Two: 

Gone, to sheer Nothing, past with null made one! 

What matters our creative endless toil, 

When, at a snatch, oblivion ends the coil? 

“It is by-gone”—How shall this riddle run? 

As good as if things never had begun. 

Yet circle back, existence to possess: 

I’d rather have Eternal Emptiness. 475 

Spiritual reality plays itself out endlessly in profane reality (as man remains eternally 
subject to the “dictates of the gods”). Individual persons therefore “unconsciously” 
embody mythological themes. Such embodiment becomes particularly evident in the case 
of great individuals, where the play of “divine forces” becomes virtually tangible. We 
analyzed sections of Leo Tolstoy’s autobiography, previously 476 —using his self-reported 
personal experience as universal exemplar for the catastrophic primary affective 
consequences of revolutionary anomaly. Tolstoy’s secondary ideological response to 
such anomaly is equally archetypal. The “news” from Western Europe—the revelation of 
the “death of God”—cascaded through the great author’s implicit and explicit culturally 
determined beliefs and action schemas, propelling him headlong, over a very lengthy 
period of time, into emotional turmoil and existential chaos. Identification with the spirit 
of denial lurked as a profound temptation in the midst of that chaos. 

Tolstoy begins the relevant section of his confession with an allegory, derived “from a 
tale of the East.” A traveler, chased by a wild beast, jumps down an old well. He grabs 
the branch of a vine that happens to be growing there, and clings to it. At the bottom of 
the well lurks an ancient dragon, mouth gaping. Above the well is the terrible beast—so 
there is no turning back. The traveler’s arms grow weak, clinging to the vine, but he still 
holds on. Then he sees two mice—one black, one white—gnawing at either side of the 
very branch that supports him. Soon they will chew their way through, and send him 
plummeting into the dragon’s gullet. The traveler sees some drops of honey, on the leaves 
of the vine. He stretches out his tongue, tastes the honey, and is comforted. For Tolstoy, 
however, the pleasures of life had lost their analgesic sweetness: 

I could not be deceived. All is vanity. Happy is he who has never been 
born; death is better than life; we must rid ourselves of life. 

Having failed to find an explanation in knowledge, I began to look for 
it in life, hoping to find it in the people around me. And so I began to 
observe people like myself to see how they lived and to determine what 
sort of relation they had with the question that had led me to despair. 

And this is what I found among people whose circumstances were 
precisely the same as mine with respect to education and way of life. 

I found that for the people of my class there were four means of 
escaping the terrible situation in which we all find ourselves. 



Maps of meaning 326 


The first means of escape is that of ignorance. It consists of failing to 
realize and to understand that life is evil and meaningless. For the most 
part, people in this category are women, or they are very young or very 
stupid men; they still have not understood the problem of life that 
presented itself to Schopenhauer, Solomon, and the Buddha. They see 
neither the dragon that awaits them nor the mice gnawing away at the 
branch they cling to; they simply lick the drops of honey. But they lick 
these drops of honey only for the time being; something will turn their 
attention toward the dragon and the mice, and there will be an end to their 
licking. There was nothing for me to learn from them, since we cannot 
cease to know what we know. 

The second escape is that of epicureanism. Fully aware of the 
hopelessness of life, it consists of enjoying for the present the blessings 
that we do have without looking at the dragon or the mice; it lies in 
licking the honey as best we can, especially in those places where there is 
the most honey on the bush. Solomon describes this escape in the 
following manner: 

“And I commended mirth, for there is nothing better for man under the 
sun than to eat, drink, and be merry; this will be his mainstay in his toil 
through the days of his life that God has given him under the sun. 

So go and eat your bread with joy and drink your wine in the gladness 
of your heart.... Enjoy life with a woman you love through all the days of 
your life of vanity, through all your vain days; for this is your fate in life 
and in the labors by which you toil under the sun.... Do whatever you can 
do by the strength of your hand, for there is no work in the grave where 
you are going, no reflection, no knowledge, no wisdom.” 

Most people of our class pursue this second means of escape. The 
situation in which they find themselves is such that it affords them more 
of the good things in life than the bad; their moral stupidity enables them 
to forget that all the advantages of their position are accidental, that not 
everyone can have a thousand women and palaces, as Solomon did; they 
forget that for every man with a thousand wives there are a thousand men 
without wives, that for every palace there are a thousand men who built it 
by the sweat of their brows, and that the same chance that has made them 
a Solomon today might well make them Solomon’s slave tomorrow. The 
dullness of the imagination of these people enables them to forget what 
left the Buddha with no peace: the inevitability of sickness, old age, and 
death, which if not today then tomorrow will destroy all these pleasures. 
The fact that some of these people maintain that their dullness of thought 
and imagination is positive philosophy does not, in my opinion, 
distinguish them from those who lick the honey without seeing the 
problem. I could not imitate these people, since I did not lack imagination 
and could not pretend that I did. Like every man who truly lives, I could 
not turn my eyes away from the mice and the dragon once I had seen 
them. 



The Hostile Brothers 327 


The third means of escape is through strength and energy. It consists of 
destroying life once one has realized that life is evil and meaningless. 

Only unusually strong and logically consistent people act in this manner. 

Having realized all the stupidity of the joke that is being played on us and 
seeing that the blessings of the dead are greater than those of the living 
and that it is better not to exist, they act and put an end to this stupid joke; 
and they use any means of doing it: a rope around the neck, water, a knife 
in the heart, a train. There are more and more people of our class who are 
acting in this way. For the most part, the people who perform these acts 
are in the very prime of life, when the strength of the soul is at its peak 
and when the habits that undermine human reason have not yet taken 
over. I saw that this was the most worthy means of escape, and I wanted 
to take it. 

The fourth means of escape is that of weakness. It consists of 
continuing to drag out a life that is evil and meaningless, knowing 
beforehand that nothing can come of it. The people in this category know 
that death is better than life, but they do not have the strength to act 
rationally and quickly put an end to the delusion by killing themselves; 
instead they seem to be waiting for something to happen. This is the 
escape of weakness, for if I know what is better and have it within my 
reach, then why not surrender myself to it? I myself belonged in this 
category. 

Thus the people of my class save themselves from a terrible 
contradiction in these four ways. No matter how much I strained my 
intellectual faculties, I could see no escape other than these four. 477 

Tolstoy’s “intellectual faculties”—his rationality—could see no way out of the dilemma 
posed by his incorporation of an indigestible idea. Furthermore, logic clearly dictated that 
existence characterized only by inevitable and pointless suffering should be brought to an 
abrupt end, as an “evil joke.” It was Tolstoy’s clear apprehension of the endless conflict 
between the individual and the conditions of existence that destroyed his ability to work 
and undermined his desire to live. He was unable to see (at least at that point in his 
journey) that man was fashioned to confront chaos constantly—to eternally work toward 
transforming it into real being—rather than to master it finally, once and for all (and to 
therefore render everything intolerably static!). 

The fact of mortal vulnerability—that defining characteristic of the individual, and the 
“reason” for his emergent disgust with life—may be rendered even more “unjust” and 
“intolerable” by the specific manifestations of such vulnerability. Some are poorer than 
others, some weaker, some unsightlier—all less able, in some regard (and some 
apparently less able in all regards). Recognition of the seemingly arbitrary distribution of 
skill and advantage adds additional rationally “justifiable” grounds for the development 
of a philosophy based on resentment and antipathy—sometimes, “on behalf’ of an entire 
class, other times, sheerly for the purposes of a specific individual. Under such 
circumstances, the desire for revenge on life itself may become paramount above all else, 
particularly for the “unfairly oppressed.” Shakespeare’s crippled Richard the Third 
speaks for all revolutionaries, all rebels, so motivated: 



Maps of meaning 328 


Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so, 

Let hell make crooked my mind to answer it. 

I have no brother, I am like no brother: 

And this word “love” which greybeards call divine, 

Be resident in men like one another 
And not in me: I am myself alone. 478 

Evil is voluntary rejection of the process that makes life tolerable, justified by 
observation of life’s terrible difficulty. This rejection is presumptious, premature, because 
it is based on acceptance of a provisional judgment as final: “everything is insufficient, 
and is therefore without worth, and nothing whatsoever can be done to rectify the 
situation.” Judgment of this sort precludes all hope of cure. Lack of belief in hope and 
meaning (which appear more than willing to vanish, in the face of rationale critique) 
seldom means commensurate “lack of belief in anxiety and despair” (even though 
recognition of the pointlessness of everything should also undermine ones faith in 
suffering). Suffering cannot be disbelieved away, however: rejection of the process that 
constantly renews the positive aspect of the “constituent elements of experience” merely 
ensures that their negative counterparts gain the upper hand. Such additional torture— 
added to that already considered sufficient to bring about hatred for life—is sure to 
produce a character motivated to perform acts worse than mere suicide. The development 
of the adversary therefore follows a predictable path, from pride (“Pride and worse 
Ambition threw me down” 479 ), through envy, to revenge 480 —to the ultimate construction 
of a character possessed by infinite hatred and envy: 

To do aught good never will be our task, 

But ever to do ill our sole delight. 

As being contrary to his high will 
Whom we resist. If then his Providence 
Out of our evil seeks to bring forth good, 

Our labor must be to pervert that end, 

And out of good still to find means of evil. 481 

Tolstoy’s nihilism—disgust with the individual and human society, combined with the 
desire for the eradication of existence—is one logical “evil” consequence of heightened 
self-consciousness. It is not, however, the only consequence, and may not even be the 
most subtle. Far more efficient—far more hidden from the perpetrator himself, and from 
his closest observers—is heightened identification with tradition and custom. This is 
envelopment in the guise of patriotism, to facilitate the turning of state power toward 
destruction. Nietzsche described such “loyalty” in the following manner: 

Definition of morality: Morality—the idiosyncrasy of decadents, with the 
ulterior motive of revenging oneself against life—successfully. I attach 
value to this definition. 482 

This description of initial motivated decision and consequent dissolution seems to me to 
characterize the processes and bifurcated final state of moral (and, therefore, 



The Hostile Brothers 329 


psychological) degeneration more accurately and potently than any purely “scientific” 
theory of psychopathology generated to date. Of course, we are at present unable to take 
our rationally reduced selves seriously enough to presume a relationship between evil as 
a “cosmic force” and our petty transgressions and self-betrayals. We believe that in 
reducing the scope and importance of our errors, we are properly humble; in truth, we are 
merely unwilling to bear the weight of our true responsibility.

Tragic encounter with the forces of the unknown is inevitable, in the course of normal 
development, given continued expansion of conscious awareness. Even socialized 
identification with the cultural canon cannot provide final protection. Unshielded 
personal contact with tragedy is inextricably linked with emergence of self- 
consciousness, which has as its mythic consequence (its virtual equivalent) heightened 
awareness of human limitation. This awareness is manifested in shame, and has been 
expressed mythologically as shame of nakedness, which is knowledge of essential 
vulnerability and weakness before the world. 

The intrinsic nature of human experience ensures that potent motivation for deceitful 
adaptation is always present. It is the encounter with what is truly horrible and terrifying, 
after all, that inspires fear and engenders avoidance. The human tendency to flee into 
false havens of security can therefore be viewed with sympathy and understanding. 
Maturation is a frightening process. Transformation from the paradisal matriarchal world 
of childhood to the fallen masculine, social world is fraught with peril. The same might 
be said about the dangers of post-apprenticeship individuality. It is not easy to become an 
adolescent after being a child. It might be said that this transition is in itself a heroic act. 
It therefore happens, upon occasion, that those who have abandoned heroism as a style of 
adaptation do not take even this first step. The relative advantages that accompany 
increased freedom may seem frightening and of dubious value, given the comparative 
responsibility and lack of security that are part and parcel of maturity. 

As maturation takes place, the “environment” transforms. As the developing 
individual masters his powers, his behavioral capacity expands. He can do more things 
and, in consequence, experience more things. The ability to bring heretofore unknown 
and, therefore, frightening phenomena into being constantly increases, and the boundaries 
of the experiential domain of the individual eventually extend beyond the area shielded 
by the parents. The capability to endlessly frirther apprehension is central to the adaptive 
capacity of the individual; this capability, however, comes at an immense price, which is 
knowledge of finitude and death. Potent motivation therefore exists to resist such 
development, when it duly emerges; to light desperately for maintenance of childhood 
ignorance, or to hide in the commands of others. Individuality—which is the ability to 
establish a realm of experience that is unique to the self; the capacity for the creation of 
purely subjective experience—also means acceptance of vulnerability and mortality. The 
creative capacity is divine Logos, which in the course of its development necessitates 



Maps of meaning 330 


recognition of the inevitability of failure and death. That is in part the meaning of the 
symbol of the Christian crucifixion, which paradoxically melds mortality with divinity; 
which portrays the “mortal god/’ infinitely creative, responsible and vulnerable. 

Individual existence means limited existence—limited in space and time. The 
existence of the limits makes experience possible; the fact of them makes experience 
unbearable. We have been granted the capacity for constant transcendence, as an 
antidote, but frequently reject that capacity, because using it means voluntarily exposing 
ourselves to the unknown. We run away because we are afraid of the unknown, at 
bottom; such fear also makes us cling to our protective social identities, which shield us 
from what we do not understand. So, while running away, we necessarily become slave 
to convention and habit, and deny the troublesome best within our selves. Why run away? 
It is fear—fear of the unknown, and its twin, fear of rejection by the protective social 
world, which leads to pathological subjugation of unique individual personality, to 
rejection of the totality of personal being (which, when manifested, has truly redemptive 
capability). The Great Father hates innovation and will kill to prevent it; the Great 
Mother, source of all new knowledge, has a face that paralyzes when encountered. How 
can we not run away, when confronted by such powers? But running away means that 
everything worthwhile ages, then dies. 

When a child is born, he is protected from the vagaries of existence by the 
benevolence of circumstance, through maternal presence; the infant is prepared, a priori, 
instinctively, to respond to such protection, and to form a relationship—a bond with the 
mother. The helpless baby is at the mother’s mercy, but is sheltered, as well, from the 
terrible world. Culture intercedes, in the form of proscriptions on behavior, when 
mortality nonetheless threatens, but adherence to such requirements means increased 
responsibility, separation from the good mother, and sacrifice of the primary dependent 
relationship. Culture molds the maturing personality, offering knowledge, but at the same 
time limitation, as the social world mangles individuality, interest and meaning. 

Spirit is offered up to the group to maintain the group’s benevolent nature, ensuring its 
continued protection and its grant of knowledge derived from history. It is necessary to 
identify with the group, in the course of normal development—that identification fosters 
maturity, and separation from blind maternal solicitude—but ultimately the group is 
tyrannical, and demands obedience at the cost of unique being. This is not to say, naively, 
that the group is intrinsically evil, that the root of human suffering is buried in the ground 
of the social world. Society is more purely expansion of power, which may be directed 
according to individual choice. The past contains within it the behavioral wisdom of 
generations, established in pain and fear, and offers the possibility of immense extension 
of individual power and ability. Culture and civilization offers each individual the 
opportunity to stand on the shoulders of giants. Adoption of group identity should 
constitute apprenticeship, not capitulation; should constitute a developmental stage in 
disciplined maturation, requiring temporary subjugation and immolation of immature 
individuality, prior to its later re-emergence, in controllable form, under voluntary 
direction. 

Group membership, social being, represents a necessary advance over childish 
dependence, but the spirit of the group requires its pound of flesh. Absolute identification 
with the group means rejection of individual difference: means rejection of “deviation,” 
even “weakness,” from the group viewpoint; means repression of individuality, sacrifice 



The Hostile Brothers 331 


of the mythic fool', means abandonment of the simple and insufficient “younger brother.” 
The group, of course, merely feels that it is doing its duty by insisting upon such 
sacrifice; it believes, with sufficient justification, that it is merely protecting its structure. 
However, the group is not capable of making final judgments regarding what is 
necessary—what is good and what is evil—because it is incomplete by its very nature: it 
is a static structure, composed of the past. Individual difference, even weakness— 
anathema to the absolutist—is strength, from a more inclusive viewpoint; is that force 
capable of transcending inevitable group limitation and extending the reach of all. 

Absolutists, rejecting the necessity of all change, necessarily deny to themselves and 
others even their own strength, because true heroism, regardless of its source, has the 
capacity to upset the status quo. Through such denial the absolutist hopes to find 
protection from his individual vulnerability. In truth, however, he has suppressed and 
pathologized the sole element within himself that could actually provide such protection; 
he has undermined his ability to utilize the sole process capable of actually providing 
security and freedom: 

A traveler who had seen many countries and peoples and several 
continents was asked what human traits he had found everywhere; and he 
answered: men are inclined to laziness. Some will feel that he might have 
said with greater justice: they are all timorous. They hide behind customs 
and opinions. At bottom, every human being knows very well that he is in 
this world just once, as something unique, and that no accident, however 
strange, will throw together a second time into a unity such a curious and 
diffuse plurality: he knows it, but hides it like a bad conscience—why? 

From fear of his neighbor who insists on convention and veils himself 
with it. 

But what is it that compels the individual human being to fear his 
neighbor, to think and act herd-fashion, and not to be glad of himself? A 
sense of shame, perhaps, in a few rare cases. In the vast majority it is the 
desire for comfort, inertia—in short, that inclination to laziness of which 
the traveler spoke. He is right: men are even lazier than they are timorous, 
and what they fear most is the troubles with which any unconditional 
honesty and nudity would burden them. 

Only artists hate this slovenly life in borrowed manners and loosely 
fitting opinions and unveil the secret, everybody’s bad conscience, the 
principle that every human being is a unique wonder; they dare to show us 
the human being as he is, down to the last muscle, himself and himself 
alone—even more, that in this rigorous consistency of his uniqueness he 
is beautiful and worth contemplating, as novel and incredible as every 
work of nature, and by no means dull. 

When a great thinker despises men, it is their laziness that he despises: 
for it is on account of this that they have the appearance of factory 
products and seem indifferent and unworthy of companionship or 
instruction. The human being who does not wish to belong to the mass 
must merely cease being comfortable with himself; let him follow his 



Maps of meaning 332 


conscience, which shouts at him: “Be yourself! What you are at present 
doing, opining, and desiring, that is not really you.” 484 

Denial of unique individuality turns the wise traditions of the past into the blind ruts of 
the present. Application of the letter of the law when the spirit of the law is necessary 
makes a mockery of culture. Following in the footsteps of others seems safe, and requires 
no thought—but it is useless to follow a well-trodden trail when the terrain itself has 
changed. The individual who fails to modify his habits and presumptions as a 
consequence of change is deluding himself—is denying the world—is trying to replace 
reality itself with his own feeble wish. By pretending things are other than they are, he 
undermines his own stability, destabilizes his future, and transforms the past from shelter 
to prison. 

The individual embodiment of collective past wisdom is turned into the 
personification of inflexible stupidity by means of the lie. The lie is straightforward, 
voluntary rejection of what is currently known to be true. Nobody knows what is finally 
true, by definition, but honest people make the best possible use of their experience. The 
moral theories of the truthful, however incomplete from some hypothetical transcendent 
perspective, account for what they have seen and for who they are, insofar as that has 
been determined in the course of diligent effort. It is not necessary to define truth, to have 
seen and heard everything—that would make truth itself something impossible. It is 
necessary only to have represented and adapted to what has been seen and heard—to 
have represented and adapted to those phenomena characterizing the natural and social 
worlds, as encountered, and the self, as manifested. This is to say, merely, that the truth 
of children and adults differs, because their experience—their reality—differs. The 
truthful child does not think like an adult: he thinks like a child, with his eyes open. The 
adult, however, who still uses the morality of the child—despite his adult capacities—he 
is lying, and he knows it. 

The lie is willful adherence to a previously functional schema of action and 
interpretation—a moral paradigm—despite new experience that cannot be comprehended 
in terms of that schema; despite new desire, which cannot find fulfillment within that 
framework. The lie is willful rejection of information apprehended as anomalous on 
terms defined and valued by the individual doing the rejecting. That is to say: the liar 
chooses his own game, sets his own rules and then cheats. This cheating is failure to 
grow, to mature; it is rejection of the process of consciousness itself. 

The lie is therefore not so much a sin of commission, in most cases, as a sin of 
omission (although it may take the former condition as well). The lie is a matter of 
voluntary failure to explore and to update. The appearance of an anomalous occurrence in 
the ongoing stream of experience indicates only that the present goal-directed schema 
within which behavior is being undertaken and evaluated is characterized by the presence 
of a flaw. The place of the flaw, the reasons for its existence, the meaning of the flaw (its 
potential for altering interpretation and behavior)—all that is hypothetical, at the first 
stage of anomaly emergence and analysis. The unknown has to be “mined” for precise 
significance, before it can be said to have been experienced, let alone comprehended; has 
to be transformed, laboriously, from pure affect into revision of presumption and action 
(into “psyche” or “personality”). “Not doing” is therefore the simplest and most common 
lie: the individual can just “not act,” “not investigate,” and the pitfalls of error will 



The Hostile Brothers 333 


remain unmanifest, at least temporarily. This rejection of the process of creative 
exploration means lack of effortful update of procedural and declarative memory, 
adaptation to the present as if it still were the past, refusal to think. The rectification of 
error is, after all, not inevitable; it is neither effortless nor automatic. Mediation of order 
and chaos requires courage and work. 

Adoption of identity with the heroes of the past is necessary, but rife with pathological 
potential. It becomes certain corruption when the identified individual is a liar, who has 
voluntarily rendered himself incapable of personal heroism. Adoption of group identity 
and position means access to the power embodied in the past—means access to the 
collective strength and technical ability of the culture. This power is terribly dangerous in 
cowardly and deceitful hands. The liar cannot see any value in weakness or deviance in 
himself or others—only the potential for chaos—and he cannot see any value in chaos or 
uncertainty. He has no sympathy or patience for or appreciation of his own weaknesses— 
or his own strengths—and can therefore have none for the weakness or strength of others. 
The liar can only pretend to embody what is best of the past, because he cannot support 
or tolerate the presence of necessary deviance in the present. This means that the liar is a 
tyrant, because he cannot stand being a fool. 

The liar cannot tolerate anomaly, because it provokes anxiety—and the liar does not 
believe that he can or should withstand anxiety. This means that he is motivated to first 
avoid and then to actively suppress any behavioral pattern or experience of world that 
does not fit comfortably into his culturally determined system of affect-regulating moral 
presuppositions. Avoidance means that anomalous experience is kept “unconscious,” so 
to speak—which means incompletely realized. The implications of the dangerous thought 
remain unconsidered; the presence of the threatening fantasy remains unadmitted; the 
existence of the unacceptable personal action remains unrecognized. Active suppression 
does not mean intrapsychic “repression,” in the classic sense, but aggressive action 
undertaken in the world to forcibly eliminate evidence of error. This may mean treachery, 
spiritual cruelty, or the outright appli-cation of power: may mean application of whatever 
maneuver is presumed necessary, to destroy all indication of insufficiency. The bearer of 
bad news therefore inevitably suffers at the hand of the deceitful individual, who would 
rather kill the source of potential wisdom than benefit from its message. 

The lie is easy, and rewarding, as it allows for the avoidance of anxiety, at least in the 
short term. In the long run, however, the lie has terrible consequences. The “avoidance or 
suppression” of novel or unexpected experience, which is the abstract equivalent of 
running away, transforms it perforce into determinate threat (is the categorical equivalent 
of labeling as threat). The domain of unprocessed novelty—defined prima facie by 
inaction and avoidance as “threat too intolerable to face”—expands inevitably with time, 
when the past is held as absolute. More and more experience is therefore rendered 
intolerable, inexplicable and chaotic, as the cumulative effects of using the lie as a mode 
of adaptation inexorably manifest themselves. The lie transforms culture into tyranny, 
change into danger, while sickening and restricting the development and flexibility of 
adaptive ability itself. Reliance on the lie ensures, as fear grows, heightened, 
pathologized identification with the past (manifested as fascism: personal and political 
intolerance), or decadent degeneration (manifested as nihilism: personal and social 
deterioration).

Identification with the spirit of denial eventually makes life unbearable, as everything 
new—and, therefore, everything defining hope—comes to be axiomatically regarded as 
punishment and threat; makes life unbearable, as the realm of acceptable action shrinks 
inexorably. The attendant and unavoidable suffering experienced generates the desire 
for—and motivates actions predicated on the attainment of—the end of all experience, as 
compensation and revenge for sterility, absence of meaning, anxiety, hatred and pain: 

The Marabout draws a large circle in the dirt, which represents the world. 

He places a scorpion, symbolic of man, inside the circle. The scorpion, 
believing it has achieved freedom, starts to run around the circle—but 
never attempts to go outside. After the scorpion has raced several times 
around the inside edge of the circle, the Marabout lowers his stick and 
divides the circle in hal*. The scorpion stops for a few seconds, then 
begins to run faster and faster, apparently looking for a way out, but never 
finding it. Strangely enough, the scorpion does not dare to cross over the 
line. After a few minutes, the Marabout divides the half circle. The 
scorpion becomes frantic. Soon the Marabout makes a space no bigger 
than the scorpion’s body. This is “the moment of truth.” The scorpion, 
dazed and bewildered, finds itself unable to move one way or another. 

Raising its venomous tail, the scorpion turns rapidly ’round and ’round in 
a veritable frenzy. Whirling, whirling, whirling until all of its spirit and 
energy are spent. In utter hopelessness the scorpion stops, lowers the 
poisonous point of its tail, and stings itself to death. Its torment is 
ended. 485 

The individual who lives by the lie continually shrinks his domain of competence, his 
“explored and familiar territory.” Eventually, in consequence, he has nowhere left to 
turn—except to himself. But his own personality has, in the meantime, become shrunken 
and inept, as a consequence of underdevelopment—as a consequence of repeated failure 
to 



The Hostile Brothers 335 



Figure 58: The Vicious Circle of the Adversary 

participate in the process that turns “precosmogonic matter” into “spirit” and “world.” 
Nothing remains blit weakness, resentment, hatred and fear. Thus the chaos that is 
rejected out of desire for too much security attains its inevitable victory. The “vicious 
circle” created by the liar spirals down inevitably to the “underworld.” This process is 
schematically represented in Figure 58: The Vicious Circle of the Adversary. 

The “patriarchal” system, the known, is the concrete consequence of past adaptation, 
the hierarchically integrated and represented residue of the heroic past. Such adaptation is 
necessarily incomplete, in that the hill scope of “natural” phenomena always exceeds the 
capacity for interpretation. Absolutist application of the past, motivated by fear of the 
unknown, transforms the past perforce into tyranny, which does not tolerate inevitable 
individual or deviant experience. This process of “absolute ancestral deification” is the 
consequence of security-seeking, made necessary by the abandonment of individual 
heroism as a potential mode of adaptation. Such abandonment occurs as a consequence of 
premature and arrogant self-definition—definition that makes of evident human 
vulnerability final and sufficient evidence for the unbearable cruelty of God and the 
uselessness of man. 

The constant search for security, rather than the embodiment of freedom, is wish for 
rule by law’s letter, rather than laws spirit. The resultant forcible suppression of deviance 
is based upon desire to support the pretence that the unknown does not exist. This 
suppression has as its consequence the elimination of creative transformation from the 




Maps of meaning 336 


individual and social spheres. The individual who denies his individual identification 
with the heroic will come to identify with and serve the tyrannical force of the past—and 
to suffer the consequences. This principle is aptly illustrated by the mythic story of Judas. 
Judas sacrifices Christ, the hero, to the authorities of tradition—for all the best reasons— 
and is then driven to destroy himself in despair: 

Then Judas, which had betrayed him, when he saw that he was 
condemned, repented himself, and brought again the thirty pieces of silver 
to the chief priests and elders, 

Saying, I have sinned in that I have betrayed the innocent blood. And 
they said. What is that to us? see thou to that. And he cast down the pieces 
of silver in the temple, and departed, and went and hanged himself. 
(Matthew 27:3-5) 

Sacrifice of the hero to the great and terrible father means abandonment of identification 
with the process that makes cosmos out of chaos. Rejection of the process whereby the 
endlessly negative and terrifying is transformed into the acceptable and beneficial means, 
by definition, the end of all hope: 

Wherefore I say unto you. All manner of sin and blasphemy shall be 
forgiven unto men: but the blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall not be 
forgiven unto men. 

And whosoever speaketh a word against the Son of man, it shall be 
forgiven him: but whosover speaketh against the Holy Ghost, it shall not 
be forgiven him, neither in this world, neither in the world to come. 
(Matthew 12:31-32) 

The individual lies to convince himself, and others, that he embodies the greatness of the 
past. He pretends to be upright and courageous, instead of acting morally and bravely. 
Truly courageous actions might turn the group against him, and it is only identity with 
that group that keeps his head above water. The lie means denial of self, means the 
abandonment of mythic identity with God, means certain involuntary “revolutionary” 
collapse, in time. The lie means conscious refusal to modify and reconfigure historically 
predicated behavior and belief to incorporate novelty and alleviate threat. 

Endless failure to voluntarily update means the generation of a morass around the 
individual, where the “water of life” once existed: what could be life-giving liquid 
becomes a deadly swamp, composed of past errors, unresolved traumas and current 
difficulties. This is the domain characterized by Freud as the “unconscious,” into which 
“repressed memories” are cast. But unprocessed information is not precisely memory. 
That which has not yet been explored is not yet memorable, not yet even “real.” The 
consequence of untaken action is more accurately “potential from which ‘spirit’ and 
‘world’ could be constructed”—much of it implicit in the world as it currently exists 
(instead of “stored in memory”). (Implicit, that is, in the form of unencountered but latent 
“trouble”—in the form of the unanswered letter, the impaid debt or the unresolved 
dispute.) 



The Hostile Brothers 337 


This self-generated swamp grows increasingly impenetrable, as time passes; becomes 
increasingly “uninhabitable,” as the consequences of long-term avoidance propagate (as 
the monsters of the bog sprout new and hungry heads). This “accumulation of 
precosmogonic potential” is tantamount to reanimation of the dragon of chaos (is 
precisely equivalent to the reawakening of Tiamat, who eternally sleeps under the secure 
and familiar world). The more restricted, fear-bound, faithless and repressive the 
particular mode of adaptation—that is, the more extreme the lie—the more horrendous, 
dangerous, intolerable and powerful the associated dragon. It is in this manner that 
attitude comes to define the world. Every attempt to wish any aspect of experience out of 
existence transforms it into an enemy. Every facet of being hidden from the light leads a 
corrupt and sun-starved existence, underground. Experience—absolute reality itself, in 
the final analysis—cannot be denied without consequence. Reality cannot be fantasized 
out of existence. The enforcement of a wish merely ensures that the information 
contained in the denied experience can neither be removed from the domain of threat nor 
utilized for adaptive purposes. 

It is possible that we are in fact adapted to the world—that we are adapted to the 
world as it actually exists, rather than to the world as we wish it might be. It is possible 
that our experience contains information precisely sufficient to ensure our happy survival. 
This means that every task left undone—every emergent “territory” left unexplored— 
comprises latent information from which competent personality could yet be extracted. If 
experience is valid as source of world and spirit then those elements of experience that 
have been avoided or suppressed or devalued may yet contain within them what is 
absolutely essential to continued successful existence. Voluntary movement toward “the 
good” would therefore mean reintegration of cast-off “material”—voluntary 
incorporation of that which appears, at present, indigestible. The alternative to this 
“voluntary pursuit of the inedible” is eventual psychological catastrophe, at the social or 
individual level, engendered through involuntary contact with the “hostile forces” of 
rejected being. From the mythological perspective, this psychological catastrophe is 
accidental reunion with the Terrible Mother, on territory of her choosing. This “Oedipal 
incest” culminates in certain suffering, on the part of the unwilling “hero”: culminates in 
suicide, dismemberment, castration—ends in the final sacrifice of “masculine” 
consciousness, and in the victory of the underworld. 

The identity of the individual with his culture protects him from the terrible unknown, 
and allows him to function as an acceptable member of society. This slavish tunction 
strengthens the group. But the group states that certain ways of thinking and acting are all 
that are acceptable, and these particular ways do not exhaust the unknown and necessary 
capabilities of the human being. The rigid, grinning social mask is the individual’s 
pretence that he is “the same person” as everyone else (that is, the same dead person)— 
that he is not a natural disaster, not a stranger, not strange—that he is not deviant, weak, 
cowardly, inferior and vengefril. The true individual, however—the honest fool—stands 
outside the protective enclave of acceptance, unredeemed—the personification of 
weakness, inferiority, vengefiilness, cowardice, difference. He cannot make the cut, and 
because he cannot make the cut, he is the target of the tyranny of the group (and of his 
own judgment, insofar as he is that group). But man as a fool, weak, ignorant and 
vulnerable, is what the group is not: a true individual, truly existing, truly experiencing, 
truly suffering (if it could only be admitted). Consciousness of intrinsic personal 



Maps of meaning 338 


limitation and apprehension of its consequences brings clear definition of the nature of 
subjective experience, when allowed to surface, and fosters attempts to adapt to that 
experience. It is for this reason that only the unredeemed—the outcast, the sick, the blind, 
and the lame—can be “saved.” Apprehension of the true nature of subjective 
experience—of individual reality, outside the delusionary constraints of the group—is of 
sufficient power to demoralize, absolutely. The eternal consequence of self- 
consciousness is therefore the expulsion from Eden, in its maternal and patriarchal forms. 
But such a fall is a step on the way to the “true paradise”—is a step toward adoption of 
identity with the hero, who is not protected from the vagaries of existence, but who can 
actively transform the terrible unknown into the sustenant and productive world. 
Acceptance (at least recognition) of the mortal limitation characterizing human 
experience therefore constitutes the precondition for proper adaptation. The lie, which 
denies individual experience, is denial of the fool—but the fool is the truth. 

Acceptance of mortal weakness is the paradoxical humility that serves as precondition 
for true heroism. The heroic attitude is predicated on the belief that something new and 
valuable still exists, to be encountered and assimilated, regardless of the power and 
stability of the current position. This belief is further based upon faith in human 
potential—upon faith that the individual spirit will respond to challenge and flourish. 
Such belief must be posited—voluntarily, freely—prior to participation in any heroic 
endeavor. This is the necessary leap that makes courageous and creative action possible; 
that makes religion something real. Humility means, therefore: I am not yet what I could 
be. This an adage both cautious and hopeful. 

The adversarial position, deceit, is predicated on the belief that the knowledge of the 
present comprises all necessary knowledge—is predicated on the belief that the unknown 
has finally been conquered. This belief is equivalent to denial of vulnerability, equivalent 
to the adoption of omniscience—“what I do is all there is to do, what I know is all there is 
to know.” Inextricably associated with the adoption of such a stance is denial, implicit or 
explicit, of the existence, the possibility, and the necessity of the heroic—as everything 
worthwhile has already been done, as all problems have been solved, as paradise has 
already been spread before us. This is a terrible position, as the axiom of faith “we are 
redeemed” makes human suffering itself (which can never be eradicated as a 
consequence of ideological identification) something heretical —something that can exist 
only as an insult to the guardians of traditional order. The authoritarian is thereby 
necessarily stripped of his empathy, even for himself: in the “perfect world,” presently 
extant, nothing imperfect may be allowed to exist. So the adversary backs himself into a 
position where he cannot admit even to his own misery (let alone the misery of others). A 
more hopeless position cannot possibly be imagined. 

Acceptance of insufficiency paradoxically catalyzes identification with the hero and 
opens up the possibility of participation in the process of creation and renewal. Rejection 
of insufficiency produces, by contrast, identification with the adversary, whose eternal 
dwelling place is hell. This hell is something whose nature can be rendered explicitly 
comprehensible, despite its mythological character; is something that has familiar and 
defined features; is something that can be understood, first and foremost, as a 
consequence of the “imbalance of the constituent elements of reality.” Adoption of the 
deceitful or adversarial mode of adaptation produces an accelerated search for security 
and increased likelihood of aggression, in those cases where identification with the 



The Hostile Brothers 339 


cultural canon is deemed possible—or degeneration of personality and decadent 
breakdown (where the costs of cultural identity are regarded as “too high,” where no such 
identity is waiting to offer protection, or where even fascistic behavior appears as 
something too positive to manifest in the all-too-unbearable world). 

Denial of the heroic promotes fascism, absolute identification with the cultural canon. 
Everything that is known, is known within a particular historically determined 
framework, predicated upon mythologically expressed assumptions. Denial or avoidance 
of the unknown therefore concomitantly necessitates deification of a particular previously 
established viewpoint. The way that things are, under such circumstances, must be the 
way they forever remain. Questioning the wisdom of the past necessarily exposes the 
anxiety-provoking unknown once again to view. This exposure of the unknown can be 
regarded as beneficial under those circumstances where positive adaptation to the 
unknown is viewed as possible, but only as destructive where lack of faith in the heroic 
rules. All that lives, however, grows. When conservatism destroys the capacity for 
individual creativity—when it becomes tyranny—then it works against life, not for it. 
The “spirit within” has withdrawn from the group afraid to develop. An absolutely 
conservative society cannot survive, because the future transcends the limitations of the 
past, and the absolute conservative wants to limit what could be to what has already been. 
If history was complete, and perfect, if the individual had frilly exploited his highest 
potential, then the human race would be run, for all would be explored, all known, all 
accomplished. But this pinnacle of attainment has not yet been reached—and perhaps 
never will be. Those who pretend the contrary rapidly come to actively oppose the very 
process that delivers what they claim to have already obtained. 

Denial of the heroic promotes decadence, equally—absolute rejection of the order of 
tradition; absolute rejection of order itself. This pattern of apprehension and behavior 
seems far removed from that of the fascist, but the decadent is just as arrogant as his 
evidently more rigid peer. He has merely identified himself absolutely with no thing, 
rather than with one thing. He is rigidly convinced of the belief that nothing matters— 
convinced that nothing is of value, despite the opinions of (clearly deluded, weak and 
despicable) others; convinced that nothing is worth the effort. The decadent functions in 
this manner like an anti-Midas—everything he touches turns to ashes. 

Under normal circumstances, the individual who reaches adolescence identifies with 
the tribe—with the collective historically determined structure designed to deal with 
threat. The normal individual solves his problem of adaptation to the unknown by joining 
a group. A group, by definition, is composed of those who have adopted a central 
structure of value, and who therefore behave, in the presence of other group members, 
identically—and if not identically, at least predictably. 

The fascist adapts to the group with a vengeance. He builds stronger and stronger 
walls around himself and those who are “like him,” in an ever more futile attempt to keep 
the threatening unknown at bay. He does this because his worldview is incomplete. He 
does not believe in the heroic aspect of the individual, does not see the negative aspect of 
the social world, and cannot visualize the beneficial aspect of chaos. He is frightened 
enough to develop the discipline of a slave, so that he can maintain his protected position 
in the group, but he is not frightened enough to transcend his slavish condition. He 
therefore remains twisted and bent. The decadent, by contrast, sees nothing but the 
tyranny of the state. Since the adversarial aspect of the individual remains conveniently 



Maps of meaning 340 


hidden from his view, he cannot perceive that his “rebellion” is nothing but avoidance of 
discipline. He views chaos as a beneficial home, seeing the source of human evil in social 
regulation, because he cannot imagine the Terrible Mother as soul-devouring force. So he 
abandons his father in the belly of the beast, unredeemed, and has no tools to rely on 
when he finally faces a true challenge. 

The decadent looks to subvert the process of maturation—looks for a “way out” of 
group affiliation. Group membership requires adoption of at least adolescent 
responsibility, and this burden may seem too much to bear, as a consequence of 
prolonged immaturity of outlook. The decadent therefore acts “as if” the paradigmatic 
structure of the group has been rendered “insufficient” as a consequence of 
environmental, cultural or intellectual change, and refuses to be the fool who risks belief. 
The proper response to “the illness of the father,” is, of course, “the journey to the land of 
living water.” The decadent makes his intellectual superiority to the “superstitions of the 
past” an article of faith, instead, and shirks his responsibility. (That is to say—it is the 
desire to shirk that responsibility [and the “heroic sacrifice” it entails], that constitutes 
motivation for belief in “intellectual superiority”) The “suffering rebel” stance that such 
adoption allows, as a secondary consequence, also serves admirably as mask for 
cowardice. 

The fascist and the decadent regard each other as opposites, as mortal enemies. They 
are in actuality two sides of the same bent coin: 

Today is Christmas day, and I have just come home from Julie’s. While I 
was there it struck me, as I sat on their couch between the two girls, just 
how foolish and idiotic I have been in this my only life. I hope you will 
have patience while I unburden myself on you, because I need desperately 
to confess my sins to someone, and I know that if I were sitting in a little 
cubicle talking to an unseen clergyman I wouldn’t do a proper job of it. 

You fit the definition of a religious man as someone who gives careful 
consideration to the demonic and irrational in humanity, so I think you 
will find my confession interesting. 

Imagine if you can a grown man who harbors in his heart the most 
vicious resentment for his fellow man, his neighbor, who is guilty of 
nothing more than embodying a superior consciousness of what it means 
to be a man. When I think of all the black, scathing thoughts I have 
directed at those who I could not look in the eye, it is almost unbearable. 

All of my lofty disdain for the “common” man, who, so I thought, was 
guilty of the sin of unconsciousness, was, I now realize, founded on 
nothing more than jealousy and spite. I hated, I absolutely loathed anyone 
who had wrestled with their fear of leaving the maternal confines of a 
childish mentality and won their battle, only because I had not done so. I 
equated independence and success with egotism and selfishness, and it 
was my fondest hope, my highest ambition, to witness and participate in 
the destruction of everything that successful, independent people had built 
for themselves. This I considered a duty. In fact there was a decidedly 
fanatical element in my urge to cleanse the world of what I perceived to 
be selfishness. 



The Hostile Brothers 341 


Think what would have happened if I had been in a position to realize 
my fine feelings! The memory makes me fear that any moment the earth 
will crack open and swallow me up, because if there is any justice it 
would. I, who had not the faintest inkling of a capacity for moral 
judgment, traipsing around passing judgment on anyone who dared cross 
my path. It makes me wonder that I have even one friend in this world. 
But of course I had friends before. Anyone with enough self-contempt 
that they could forgive me mine. 

It is fortunate for humanity that there are few saviors of the caliber of 
myself. Did you know that I used to identity with Christ? I considered 
myself entirely, immaculately free of aggression and every other form of 
antisocial feeling. But what about the hatred I have just now confessed, 
you ask? That didn’t count. Those feelings were based on sound common 
sense, you see. After all, there are sons of bitches in the world, and one 
needs to be ready for them. (Do I smell ozone? They say you get a 
tingling sensation just before the lightning bolt strikes.) 

That is a very apt phrase, son of a bitch. There is a passage in Jung’s 
Phenomenology’ of the Self which runs: “Often a mother appears beside 
him who apparently shows not the slightest concern that her little son 
should become a man, but who, with tireless and self-immolating effort, 
neglects nothing that might hinder him from growing up and marrying. 
You now behold the secret conspiracy between mother and son, and how 
each helps the other to betray life.” This insight would be useful for me as 
an excuse, being a perfectly accurate description of my situation, were it 
not for the fact that I am almost daily presented with a residual bit of 
undiluted evil in myself. For example, when I am faced with a frustrating 
situation I do not ask myself what I am going to do about it. I ask myself 
who is responsible for it—and I am always ready to conclude that if the 
other person were to act properly then the problem would not exist. What 
is evil about that, you ask? Obviously if I am determined to overlook my 
own part in the failure to resolve my own frustrations, if I am determined 
to find a scapegoat for my problems, then I am just a stone’s throw away 
from the mentality that was responsible for Hitler’s final solution, or for 
the Spanish inquisition, or for Lenin’s cultural cleansing. 

What was it you told me when I complained about the flaws in 
capitalism, about the fact that so many people take advantage of the 
capitalist system? Something like “the fact that people go on 
consolidating their financial position ad nauseam is another problem, but 
it is no reason to conclude that there is anything virtuous in refusing to 
even try to consolidate one’s position in the first place.” But it is so much 
easier to crown one’s cowardice and laziness with the accolade of virtue. 
Just ask Lenin’s henchmen, who swaggered around the countryside 
robbing every farmer who had managed any success whatever, and called 
themselves friends of the common people and patted each other on the 
back for their moral uprightness! I wonder if I have changed so much that 
I would not join them when put to the test. The idea that morality stems 



Maps of meaning 342 


from a lack of personal interests is thoroughly ingrained in my mind. 
“Good people are those who don’t want anything for themselves” is the 
way I think. But I never ask myself why such a person should put any 
effort into disciplining himself, or take any pains to keep his motives clear 
in his own mind, because there is nothing of value to him in this world. 

In his essay Relations Between the Ego and the Unconscious Jung says 
that in an unconscious state the individual is torn by the conflict of 
opposites, and that achieving consciousness involves resolving that 
conflict on a higher level. (I understand that this particular state of adult 
unconsciousness is different from the original state of child-like 
unconsciousness, in which there is no long-term conflict.) Just last week I 
was stuck in that dead-end again. I was sitting and thinking about what 
course my life should be taking, and at every imagined scenario of a 
fulfilling or meaningful activity I was met by a counterpoint coming from 
somewhere in my head, showing me how this or that aspect of my 
scenario was wrong because it would result in this or that problem, to the 
point where it was unacceptable to consider any career at all because just 
by being alive I would contribute to the destruction of the planet. And as 
badly as I wanted to refute this echo of wrong to my every imagined right 
as an irrational chimera, the fact is, so I told myself, that we see daily in 
the newspapers how the activities of humanity, which are also the 
activities of individual men and women, are causing incalculable harm. 

It is of course due to my being influenced by yourself that I do not 
remain stuck in that particular bog too long these days. If our 
industrialism is causing problems, I now answer myself, then I should 
hope that there are people out there working to solve those problems, or 
perhaps I should try to do something about them myself, but by sitting 
idly by I do not solve a thing. Of course what is most daunting, and also 
most snivelly, about being stuck in that bog is the fact that the rational 
mind wants to be absolutely sure about the successful outcome of its life 
plan, and obviously there is another part of the mind that knows that such 
certainty is impossible, so one is then faced with the need to accept on 
faith that things will turn out for the better with some luck and 
perseverance. And being a fine upstanding modern mouse with an 
enlightened rational mind, I have no use for faith and other such religious 
sounding claptrap and nonsense. Faith is obviously irrational, and I’ll not 
have any irrationality influencing my behavior. 

Previously my solution to this problem was to allow chance to make 
my career choices for me, letting my own interests influence my decisions 
as little as possible, and I then believed that I had somehow avoided 
personal responsibility for the state of the modern world, because I was 
not really responsible for the state of my life, and that I had escaped from 
the possibility that my plans wouldn’t work out because I had no plans. It 
was on this rock-solid foundation that I looked out at the world, and saw 
around me people who were stupid enough to add their own selves into 
the equation. 



The Hostile Brothers 343 


To put this kind of faith in oneself, to believe that there exists inside of 
oneself a motive force, call it an interest, which will respond to life and 
carry one through uncertainty and adversity is an irrational attitude 
without equal, and it is with this irrational approach to life that the conflict 
of the opposites is resolved, it seems to me. But the problem now is this: 
in order to have this faith in one’s irrational nature one needs proof that 
personal interests and passions are capable of sustaining one through the 
uncertainties and adversities of life that the rational mind foresees so 
clearly, and the only way to get that proof is to risk oneself and see the 
result. It is a very exceptional person who can take such an undertaking on 
their own. Most of us need guidance and support from others, from 
believers, so to speak. Strange, isn’t it, that religious terms should become 
useful for this discussion?

in Milton’s Paradise Lost is a metaphor for the rational intellect, placed in 
the position of the highest psychic authority. “Better to rule in hell than to 
serve in heaven.” Hell, then, is a condition in which the rational mind, 
with its acute consciousness of the many perils of life, holds sway over 
the individual and effectively prevents him from engaging in life, which 
results in the morally degenerate state of weakness that I described in the 
first pages of this letter. And heaven, I presume, would be a condition in 
which the rational mind subordinates itself to faith in...in God. But what 
is God? 





Maps of meaning 344 


You have a chapter in the manuscript of your book titled 77?e Divinity Of 
Interest. Your ideas are starting to make sense to me now—at least I think 
they are. Faith in God means faith in that which kindles one’s interest, and 
leads one away from the parental sphere out into the world. To deny those 
interests is to deny God, to fall from heaven and land squarely in hell, 
where one’s passions burn eternally in frustration. What was it God said 
when he cast Adam out of Eden? Something about working in the dust to 
the end of his days, with the spectre of death always looming in the future. 

I can certainly relate to that. One of the most vivid impressions I get from 
recalling all those years I spent moving from one job to the next is the 
pointlessness of my daily life back then, and the glaring knowledge that 
the end was drawing near. But when I’m doing something that has 
meaning for me, something that interests me, as I am right now, death 
seems far away, and work seems quite agreeable, even joyous. 486 

This “theory of the genesis of social psychopathology”—this theory of a direct 
relationship obtaining between personal choice and fascistic or decadent personality and 
social movement—finds its precise echo in Taoist philosophy, and can be more 
thoroughly comprehended through application of that perspective. The traditional Taoist 
believes that profane human experience consists of the differentiated parts of an 
essentially uncategorizable back-ground—the Tao, which may also be interpreted as 
“meaning” or as “the way.” 487 Tao manifests itself as the eternal flux of being. The 
“natural categories” of Yin and Yang, represented in Figure 59: The Constituent 
Elements of Existence, Reprise, constitute the most fundamental “divisions” of Tao, the 
basic maternal and patriarchal constituent elements of experience. Much of ancient 
Chinese philosophy (cosmology, medicine, political theory, religious thinking) is 
predicated on the idea that pathology is caused by a relative excess of one primordial 
“substance” or the other. The goal of the Chinese sage—physician, spiritual leader or 
social administrator—is to establish or re-establish harmony between the fundamental 
“feminine” and “masculine” principles, and to diagnose and cure the faulty action or 
irresponsible inactions that led to their original discord. The schematic representation of 
Yin and Yang, portrayed in Figure 59, utilizes the image of a circle to represent totality; 
the paisleys that make up that circle are opposed but balanced. The image is rendered 
additionally sophisticated by the presence of the white circle in the black paisley, and 
vice versa. Too much chaos breeds desire for order. Yin may therefore serve as mother to 
Yang. Conversely, too much order breeds the desire for novelty, as antidote to stultifying 
predictability. In this manner, Yang serves as father to Yin. 

The fascist, who will not face the reality and necessity of the unknown, hides his 
vulnerable face in a “pathological excess of order.” The decadent, who refuses to see that 
existence is not possible without order, hides his immaturity from himself and others in a 
“pathological excess of chaos.” The fascist is willing to sacrifice painful freedom for 
order, and to pretend that his unredeemed misery is meaningless, so that he does not have 
to do anything for himself. The decadent believes that freedom can be attained without 
discipline and responsibility, because he is ignorant of the terrible nature of “the 
undifferentiated ground of reality” and is unwilling to bear the burden of order. When he 
starts to suffer, as he certainly will, he will not allow the reality of his suffering to prove 



The Hostile Brothers 345 


to him that some things are real, because acceptance of that proof would force him to 
believe and to act (would force him as well toward painful realization of the 
counterproductive and wasteful stupidity of his previous position). 

The fascistic mode of adaptation is, above all, a method for the direct control of the 
unknown and unpredictable. Modern human beings, like the ancients, identify the 
stranger implicitly with the dragon of chaos. The stranger acts unpredictably, and thinks 
unpredictable things—things which might have dramatic and unsettling effect, if they 
were allowed frill expression. Extreme conservatism allows for restriction of uncertainty, 
for evasion of the unknown. It performs this function by ensuring that each member of 
the group acts, imagines and thinks precisely like every other member (generally, 
precisely like the leader—a dark parody of the hero). In times of heightened uncertainty, 
periods of increased unemployment or unsettled political structure, the call for return to 
the “glorious past” therefore always arises. The fascist, dominated by his fear, believes 
that the world should only be order, because disorder is too frightening to consider. This 
makes the cosmos he creates—when granted the opportunity—a place of endless sterility 
and machinelike organization. This increased conformity allows at least for the temporary 
alleviation and restriction of anxiety, but damages the capacity of the group (his group, 
that is) to respond flexibly to inevitable change. It is as if, to use a biological metaphor, 
the fascist strives to force all the genetic diversity out of his “species.” No diversity 
means no variance in response to new challenges; means one solution (likely the wrong 
one) to every problem. The suppression of deviance, of the unknown, therefore merely 
ensures its irrepressible emergence in negative guise, at some undetermined point in the 
future (as problems ignored do not go away, but get worse, as they follow their own 
peculiar developmental path). The order the fascist imposes, therefore, bears within it the 
seeds of its own destruction. 

The fascist tends to be cruel as well as rigid and will pursue his cruelty even at the cost 
of his own stability. The Nazi persecution of the Jews, for example, continued at an 
increasing rate (and with increasingly harsh procedures) as it became more and more 
evidently a burden to the war effort. Nazi hatred therefore became a force so potent, as 
the Third Reich developed, that it overcame Nazi patriotism, motivated by mortal terror 
of the unknown. Underneath the fascist’s professed patriotism and cowardly love of order 
is an even more profound phenomenon: hatred for the tragic conditions of existence, and 
for the vulnerable life that makes those conditions evident. 

For they reasoned unsoundly, saying to themselves, “Short and sorrowful 
is our life, and there is no remedy when a man comes to his end, and no 
one has been known to return from Hades 

Because we were born by mere chance, and hereafter we shall be as 
though we had never been; because the breath in our nostrils is smoke, 
and reason is a spark kindled by the beating of our hearts. 

When it is extinguished, the body will turn to ashes, and the spirit will 
dissolve like empty air. Our name will be forgotten in time and no one 
will remember our works; our life will pass away like the traces of a 
cloud, and be scattered like mist that is chased by the rays of the sun and 
overcome by its heat. 



Maps of meaning 346 


For our allotted time is the passing of a shadow, and there is no return 
from our death, because it is sealed up and no one turns back. 

Come, therefore, let us enjoy the good things that exist, and make use 
of the creation to the foil as in youth. 

Let us take our fill of costly wine and perfumes, and let no flower of 
spring pass by us. 

Let us crown ourselves with rosebuds before they wither. 

Let none of us fail to share in our revelry, everywhere let us leave signs 
of enjoyment, because this is our portion, and this our lot. 

Let us oppress the righteous poor man; let us not spare the widow nor 
regard the gray hairs of the aged. 

But let our might be our law of right, for what is weak proves itself to 
be useless.” (Wisdom 2:1-11, RSV) 

Fascist cruelty is motivated by the affective consequences of pathologically increased 
order. When the “water of life” dries up, nothing is left of existence but its inevitable 
pains and frustrations, compounded by terrible boredom. Furthermore, anomaly 
inevitably accumulates, as order is imposed in an increasingly strict manner. This adds 
increased apprehension of chaos to pain, frustration and stultification. Individuals 
“subjected” to a surfeit of such emotions “have every reason” to be vengeful, aggressive 
and cruel; have placed themselves in a state where the emergence of such motivation is 
certain. 

The unknown appears only when there has been error. The fascist says, “I know 
everything there is to know.” Fie cannot, therefore, make an error. But error is the mother 
of all things. The inability to admit to imperfection, therefore, means withdrawal from 
every informative situation. This means death of continued adaptation—and certain 
future reemergence of the unknown, in negative guise. If you do not change, in the face 
of constant slow transformation, then the discrepancies and unresolved errors pile up, and 
accumulate. The more stubborn (read: arrogant) you are, the longer the period of time 
during which this accretion occurs. Sooner or later so much unknown surrounds you that 
it is no longer avoidable. At that point the dragon of the underworld emerges, and 
swallows you whole. Then you live in the belly of the beast, in darkness, in the night, in 
the kingdom of the dead. Flatred comes easily, in such an environment. 

The decadent says, “there is no such thing as to know ?’—and never attempts to 
accomplish anything. Like his authoritarian counterpart, he makes himself “immune from 
error,” since mistakes are always made with regard to some valued, fixed and desired 
end. The decadent says, “look, here is something new, something inexplicable; that is 
evidence, is it not, that everything that I have been told is wrong. Flistory is unreliable; 
rules are arbitrary; accomplishment is illusory. Why do anything, under such 
circumstances?” But he is living on borrowed time—feeding, like a parasite, on the 
uncomprehended body of the past. If he works sufficiently hard, and saws off the branch 
on which he is sitting, then he will fall, too, into the jaws of the thing he ignored. 

The habitual act of avoidance—of rejection—weakens the personality, in a direct 
causal manner. The strength of a personality might be defined, in part, as its breadth of 
explored territory, its capacity to act appropriately in the greatest number of 
circumstances. Such strength is evidently dependent upon prior learning—at least upon 



The Hostile Brothers 347 


learning how to act—and knowledge of how to act is generated and renewed as a 
consequence of constant, voluntary, exploratory behavior. If everything new and different 
is rejected out of hand, the personality cannot adjust itself to changing circumstances. 
Circumstances change inevitably, however, as a consequence of simple maturation; as a 
consequence of entropy itself. It is of little use to be entirely prepared for the past; 
furthermore, it is only possible to remain prepared for the future, by facing the present. 
Anomaly is, therefore, spiritual “food,” in the most literal sense: the unknown is the raw 
material out of which the personality is manufactured, in the course of exploratory 
activity. The act of rejecting anomaly transforms the personality into something starved, 
something senile, and something increasingly terrified of change, as each failure to face 
the truth undermines capacity to face truth in the future. The man who comes to adopt an 
inappropriate attitude toward the unknown severs his connection with the source of all 
knowledge, undermining his personality, perhaps irreparably. This dissolution of strength 
is self-perpetuating: every weakness increases the likelihood of further weakness: 

For he that hath, to him shall be given: and he that hath not, from him 

shall be taken even that which he hath. (Mark 4:25) 

The individual who turns away from indications of his own insufficiency increases the 
probability that he will seek to repress and destroy all information that indicates threat to 
current belief. Avoided, suppressed or otherwise undeveloped elements of personality are 
not accessible for use in conscious adaptation—will in fact offer resistance to such 
adaptation, as a consequence of their “resentment” at being twisted and ignored. Failure 
to utilize frill human potential severely undermines strength of individual character. 
Dissociation of action, imagination and ideation weakens personality. Weakness of 
personality means inability to bear the weight of the conscious world. The result of the 
hypocritical suppression of individual differences, in the service of the social unit and its 
intrapsychic representative, is frailty in the face of the unknown: 

And if a house be divided against itself, that house cannot stand. (Mark 

3:25) 


The Adversary In Action: A Twentieth-Century Allegory 

Jung once said that “any internal state of contradiction, unrecognized, will be played out 
in the world as fate.” This statement carries with it the apparent stamp of mysticism. How 
could the world play out a psychological condition (or the refusal to recognize a 
psychological condition)? Well, the purpose of abstraction is to represent experience, and 
to manipulate the representations, to further successful adaptation. If we both want the 
same toy, we can argue about our respective rights to it; if the argument fails, or if we 
refuse to engage in it, we can fight. If we are suffering from moral uncertainty, at the 
philosophical level, and cannot settle the internal war, then our behavior reflects our inner 
disquiet, and we act out our contradictions in behavior, much to our general discredit. 
Thus the means of settling a dispute cascade, with each failure, down the chain of 
abstraction: from the word, to the image, to the deed—and those who will not let their 
outdated identities and beliefs die, when they must, kill themselves instead. Aleksandr

Solzhenitsyn describes how “order and predictability” were thereby established in the 
Soviet Union, during Stalin’s extensive reign of terror: 

A. B-v has told how executions were carried out at Adak—a camp 

on the Pechora River. They would take the opposition members “with 
their things” out of the camp compound on a prisoner transport at night. 

And outside the compound stood the small house of the Third Section. 

The condemned men were taken into a room one at a time, and there the 
camp guards sprang on them. Their mouths were stuffed with something 
soft and their arms were bound with cords behind their backs. Then they 
were led out into the courtyard, where harnessed carts were waiting. The 
bound prisoners were piled on the carts, from five to seven at a time, and 
driven off to the “Gorka”—the camp cemetery. On arrival they were 
tipped into big pits that had already been prepared and buried alive. Not 
out of brutality, no. 

It had been ascertained that when dragging and lifting them, it was 
much easier to cope with living people than with corpses. 

The work went on for many nights at Adak. 

And that is how the moral-political unity of our Party was achieved. 488 

The invention, establishment and perfection of the concentration camp, the efficient 
genocidal machine, might be regarded as the crowning achievement of human 
technological and cultural endeavor, motivated by resentment and loathing for life. 
Invented by the English, rendered efficient by the Germans, applied on a massive scale 
by the Soviets and the Chinese, revivified by the Balkan conflict—perfection of the 
factory whose sole product is death has required truly multinational enterprise. Such 
enterprise constitutes, perhaps, the prime accomplishment of the cooperative 
bureaucratization of hatred, cowardice and deceit. Tens of millions of innocent people 
have been dehumanized, enslaved and sacrificed in these efficient disassembly lines, in 
the course of the last century, to help their oppressors maintain pathological stability and 
consistency of moral presumption, enforced through terror, motivated by adherence to the 
lie. 

The very name has an uncanny aspect: horrifying, ironical, allegorical. Camp —that is 
summer sun and holiday, satirical comedy and masquerade, military rule, obedience and 
efficiency: death camp—the very devil’s idea of a joke, of camp; black humor and 
vacation paradise; the dystopian state induced in reality by diligent pursuit of fantastic 
ideal, ideological purity, statist heaven on earth. Concentration camp—that is 
concentration of people in arbitrary association, restriction of movement and thought to a 
particular area; concentration of the processes of human life, distillation, reduction to 
essence, forcing attention to, concentration on, the central values underlying human 
endeavor. 

The concentration camp has spawned its own literature, remembrance of survival 
under conditions as harsh as imagination can construct—human imagination, capable of 
positing the existence and describing the nature of an eternally torturous hell, with walls 
seven miles thick, lit by a fire which consumes and renews flesh, simultaneously, so it 
can once again be burned away. 489 This camp literature has a strange affective and

descriptive consistency—a consequence of the constant re-emergence of patterned, innate 
modes of adaptive action and thought, arising naturally in response to experience of 
overwhelming anomaly and extreme threat. 

Camp life is still human existence, analogous to normal life in all its facets, but made 
starker, less ambiguous, clarified, laid bare: 

“Pardon me, you...love life? You, you! You who exclaim and sing over 
and over and dance it too: ‘I love you, life! Oh, I love you, life!’ Do you? 

Well, go on, love it! Camp life—love that too! It too, is life! 

There where there is no struggle with fate, 

there you will resurrect your soul... 

You haven’t understood a thing. When you get there, you’11 collapse.” 490 

The extreme nature of camp conditions appears merely to augment tendencies for 
behavior always present, under normal conditions; appears merely to exaggerate the 
expression of possibilities innately characteristic of the human soul. 

Camp incarceration, in the typical case, begins with the fall, with arrest: unexpected, 
unjust, arbitrary, implacable and terrifying. The prisoner-to-be starts his involuntary 
descent into the underworld with his historically determined defenses intact, firmly 
embedded in his cultural context, entrenched in his persona—identified with his job, his 
social status, his view of the present, his hopes for the future. The initial intrusion of fate 
into this self-deceptive security occurs at night. Arrest takes place without warning, in the 
early hours of the morning, when people are easily frightened, dazed and less likely to 
offer resistance, more willing to cooperate, in their fear and naive hope—afraid for the 
security of their nervously gathered family, standing helpless in their household, at the 
mercy of state authority, in its most contemptible and repressive incarnation: 

“That’s all there is to it! You are arrested!” 

And you’ll find nothing better to respond with than a lamblike bleat: 

“Me? What for?” 

That’s what arrest is: it’s a blinding flash and a blow which shifts the 
present instantly into the past and the impossible into omnipotent 
actuality. 

That’s all. And neither for the first hour nor for the first day will you be 
able to grasp anything else. 

Except that in your desperation the fake circus moon will blink at you: 

“It’s a mistake! They’ll set things right!” 

And everything which is by now comprised in the traditional, even 
literary, image of an arrest will pile up and take shape, not in your own 
disordered memory, but in what your family and your neighbours in your 
apartment remember: The sharp nighttime ring or the rude knock at the 
door. The insolent entrance of the unwiped jackboots of the unsleeping 
State Security operatives. The frightened and cowed civilian witness at 
their backs.... 



Maps of meaning 350 


The traditional image of arrest is also trembling hands packing for the 
victim—a change of underwear, a piece of soap, something to eat; and no 
one knows what is needed, what is permitted, what clothes are best to 
wear; and the Security agents keep interrupting and hurrying you: 

“You don’t need anything. They’ll feed you there. It’s warm there.” 

(It’s all lies. They keep hurrying you to frighten you.)... 

The kind of night arrest described is, in fact, a favourite, because it has 
important advantages. Everyone living in the apartment is thrown into a 
state of terror by the first knock at the door. The arrested person is torn 
from the warmth of his bed. He is in a daze, half-asleep, helpless, and his 
judgment is befogged. In a night arrest the State Security men have a 
superiority in numbers; there are many of them, armed, against one person 
who hasn’t even finished buttoning his trousers. 491 

Arrest means instantaneous depersonalization, isolation from family, friends and social 
position. This forcibly induced shift of context removes, by design, all concrete 
reminders of group identity, all hallmarks of social hierarchy, destroys all previous ideals, 
undermines all goal-directed activity—exposes essential human vulnerability and 
subjects it to ruthless exploitation. The arrested individual is brutally stripped of every 
reminder of previous identity, his predictable environment, his conditional hope—left 
bereft even of his clothes and hair. He is treated with utmost contempt and derision, 
regardless of his previous social status. This complete destruction of social context, of 
social identity, heightens the newly arrested individual’s sense of self-consciousness, of 
nakedness and vulnerability. This leaves him unbearably anxious, tremendously 
uncertain, miserably subject to a new and uncertain world—or underworld: 

We waited in a shed which seemed to be the anteroom to the disinfecting 
chamber. SS men appeared and spread out blankets into which we had to 
throw all our possessions, all our watches and jewellry. There were still 
naive prisoners among us who asked, to the amusement of the more 
seasoned ones who were there as helpers, if they could not keep a 
wedding ring, a medal, or a good-luck piece. No one could yet grasp the 
fact that everything would be taken away. 

I tried to take one of the old prisoners into my confidence. 
Approaching him furtively, I pointed to the roll of paper in the inner 
pocket of my coat and said, “Look, this is the manuscript of a scientific 
book. I know what you will say; that I should be glad to escape with my 
life, that that should be all I can expect of fate. But I cannot help myself. I 
must keep this manuscript at all costs; it contains my life’s work. Do you 
understand that?” 

Yes, he was beginning to understand. A grin spread slowly over his 
face, first piteous, then more amused, mocking, insulting, until he 
bellowed one word at me in answer to my question, a word that was ever 
present in the vocabulary of the camp inmates: “Shit!” At that moment I 
saw the plain truth and did what marked the culminating point of the first 



The Hostile Brothers 351 


phase of my psychological reaction: I struck out the whole of my former 
life. 492 

The arrested individual has no specific sociohistorically determined intrapsychic structure 
to protect himself from the terrible world of incarceration and slavery; no model of desire 
and expectation to inhibit his mortal terror, to guide his activity and to channel his hope. 
He has been forcibly ejected from paradise, made intolerably aware of his own essential 
limitations, his own nakedness, has been sentenced to endless labor and subjugation. In 
consequence, he has been rendered vulnerable to his worst fears, his most chaotic 
psychological states, and his most severe depressions: 

Here is how it was with many others, not just with me. Our initial, first 
prison sky consisted of black swirling storm clouds and black pillars of 
volcanic eruptions—this was the heaven of Pompeii, the heaven of the 
Day of Judgment, because it was not just anyone who had been arrested, 
but I—the center of this world. 

Our last prison sky was infinitely high, infinitely clear, even paler than 
sky-blue. 

We all (except religious believers) began from one point: we tried to 
tear our hair from our head, but our hair had been clipped close!... How 
could we? How could we not have seen those who informed against us?! 

How could we not have seen our enemies? (And how we hated them! 

How could we avenge ourselves on them?) And what recklessness! What 
blindness! How many errors! How can they be corrected? They must be 
corrected all the more swiftly! We must write.. .We must speak out... We 
must communicate.... 

But—there is nothing we can do. And nothing is going to save us! At 
the appropriate time we will sign Form 206. At the appropriate time the 
tribunal will read us our sentence, in our presence, or we will learn it in 
absentia from the OSO. 

Then there begins the period of transit prisons. Interspersed with our 
thoughts about our future camp, we now love to recall our past: How well 
we used to live! (Even if we lived badly.) But how many unused 
opportunities there were! How many flowers we left uncrumpled!... 

When will we now make up for it? If I only manage to survive—oh, how 
differently, how wisely, I am going to live! The day of our future release? 

It shines like a rising sun! 

And the conclusion is: Survive to reach it! Survive! At any price! 

This is simply a turn of phrase, a sort of habit of speech: “at any price.” 

But then the words swell up with their frill meaning, and an awesome 
vow takes shape: to survive at any price. 

And whoever takes that vow, whoever does not blink before its 
crimson burst—allows his own misfortune to overshadow both the entire 
common misfortune and the whole world. 

This is the great fork of camp life. From this point the roads go to the 
right and to the left. One of them will rise, and the other will descend. If 



Maps of meaning 352 


you go to the right you lose your life, and if you go to the left—you lose 
your conscience. 493 

Work at a killing pace characterizes concentration camp life—work under conditions 
made deathly harsh, for the sake of the sheer aesthetic quality of the misery; senseless 
labor—mere parody of productive work 494 —accompanied by constant, consciously 
arranged privation: 

The most ghastly moment of the twenty-four hours of camp life was the 
awakening, when, at a still nocturnal hour, the three shrill blows of a 
whistle tore us pitilessly from our exhausted sleep and from the longings 
in our dreams. We then began the tussle with our wet shoes, into which 
we could scarcely force our feet, which were sore and swollen with 
edema. And there were the usual moans and groans about petty troubles, 
such as the snapping of wires which replaced shoelaces. One morning I 
heard someone, whom I knew to be brave and dignified, cry like a child 
because he finally had to go to the snowy marching grounds in his bare 
feet, as his shoes were too shrunken for him to wear. In those ghastly 
moments, I found a little bit of comfort: a small piece of bread which I 
drew out of my pocket and munched with absorbed delight. 495 

In cold lower than 60 degrees below zero [!], workdays were written 
off: in other words, on such days the records showed that the workers had 
not gone out to work; but they chased them out anyway, and whatever 
they squeezed out of them on those days was added to the other days, 
thereby raising the percentages. (And the servile Medical Section wrote 
off those who froze to death on such cold days on some other basis. And 
the ones who were left who could no longer walk and were straining every 
sinew to crawl along on all fours on the way back to camp, the convoy 
simply shot, so that they wouldn’t escape before they could come back to 
get them). 496 

No one can immerse himself in description of the consciously perpetrated horrors of the 
twentieth century without recognizing, first, that such evil was perpetrated in large part 
by the well-socialized and obedient. No one can come to such recognition—which is self¬ 
comprehension, as well—and remain unimpressed by the power and profundity of 
literary and mythic representations of the power of evil: that living force, that eternally 
active, transcendent personality, intrapsychically incarnate; that permanent aspect of 
man—every man—dedicated solely, vengefully to destruction, dissolution, suffering and 
death: 


O Rose, thou art sick! 
The invisible worm 
That flies in the night 
In the howling storm. 
Hath found out thy bed 
Of crimson joy 



The Hostile Brothers 353 


And his dark secret love 
Does thy life destroy. 497 

The Rwandan massacres, the killing fields in Cambodia, the tens of millions dead (by 
Solzhenitsyn’s estimate) as a consequence of internal repression in the Soviet Union, the 
untold legions butchered during China’s Cultural Revolution [the Great Leap Forward (!), 
another black joke, accompanied upon occasion, in the particular, by devouring of the 
victim], the planned humiliation and rape of hundreds of Muslim women in Yugoslavia, 
the holocaust of the Nazis, the carnage perpetrated by the Japanese in mainland China— 
such events are not attributable to human kinship with the animal, the innocent animal, or 
even by the desire to protect territory, interpersonal and intrapsychic, but by a deep- 
rooted spiritual sickness, endemic to mankind, the consequence of unbearable self- 
consciousness, apprehension of destiny in suffering and limitation, and pathological 
refusal to face the consequences thereof. 

Man is not merely innately aggressive, a poorly socialized, and therefore uncontrolled 
predator; at best, such theory can account for his criminal aggression; it is in fact slavish 
adherence to the forces of socialization—to the very principle of domestication itself— 
that enables him to participate in production of the most truly efficient and organized of 
human evils. It was the discipline of the Germans, not their criminality, that made the 
Nazis fearsome. It was the loyalty, patriotism and commitment of the Soviet and Chinese 
communists that enabled the mass persecution and destructive-labor camp elimination of 
their countrymen. Neither is man a victim of society, innocent lamb perverted by social 
forces beyond individual control. Man created society in his own image; it enables him as 
much as it corrupts him. Man chooses evil, for the sake of the evil. Man exults in agony, 
delights in pain, worships destruction and pathology. Man can torture his brother and 
dance on his grave. Man despises life, his own weak life, and the vulnerability of others, 
and constantly works to lay waste, to undermine, to destroy, to torment, to abuse and 
devour: 


From the side we looked like two reddish stones in the field. 

Somewhere young men of our age were studying at the Sorbonne or at 
Oxford, playing tennis during their ample hours of relaxation, arguing 
about the problems of the world in student cafes. They were already being 
published and were exhibiting their paintings. They were twisting and 
turning to find ways of distorting the insufficiently original world around 
them in some new way. They railed against the classics for exhausting all 
the subjects and themes. They railed at their own governments and their 
own reactionaries who did not want to comprehend and adopt the 
advanced experience of the Soviet Union. They recorded interviews 
through the microphones of radio reporters, listening all the time to their 
own voices and coquettishly elucidating what they wished to say in their 
last or their first book. They judged everything in the world with self- 
assurance, but particularly the prosperity and justice of our country. Only 
at some point in their old age, in the course of compiling encyclopedias, 
would they notice with astonishment that they could not find any worthy 
Russian names for our letters—for all the letters of our alphabet. 



Maps of meaning 354 


The rain drummed on the back of our heads, and the chill crept up our 
wet backs. 

We looked about us. The half-loaded cars had been overturned. 
Everyone had left. There was no one in the entire clay pit, nor in the entire 
field beyond the compound. Out in the gray curtain of rain lay the hidden 
village, and even the roosters had hidden in a dry place. 

We, too, picked up our spades, so that no one would steal them—they 
were registered in our names. And dragging them behind us like heavy 
wheelbarrows, we went around Matronina’s plant beneath the shed where 
the empty galleries wound all around the Hoffman kilns that fired the 
bricks. There were drafts here and it was cold, but it was also dry. We 
pushed ourselves down into the dust beneath the brick archway and sat 
there. 

Not far away from us a big heap of coal was piled. Two zeks 49S were 
digging into it, eagerly seeking something there. When they found it, they 
tried it in their teeth, then put it in their sack. Then they sat themselves 
down and each ate a similar black-grey lump. 

“What are you eating there, fellows?” 

“It’s ‘sea clay.’ The doctor doesn’t forbid it. It doesn’t do any good, 
but it doesn’t do any harm either. And if you add a kilo of it a day to your 
rations, it’s as if you had really eaten. Go on, look for some; there’s a lot 
of it among the coal.” 

And so it was that right up to nightfall the clay pit did not fulfill its 
work norms. Matronina gave orders that we should be left out all night. 
But.. .the electricity went out everywhere, and the work compound had no 
lights, so they called everyone in to the gatehouse. They ordered us to link 
arms, and with a beefed-up convoy, to the barking of dogs and curses, 
they took us to the camp compound. Everything was black. We moved 
along without seeing where it was wet and where the earth was firm, 
kneading it all up in succession, losing our footing and jerking one 
another. 

And in the camp compound it was dark. Only a hellish glow came from 
beneath the burners for “individual cooking.” And in the mess hall two 
kerosene lamps burned next to the serving window. And you could not 
read the slogan, nor see the double portion of nettle gruel in the bowl, and 
you sucked it down with your lips by feel. 

And tomorrow would be the same and every day: six cars of red clay— 
three scoops of black gruel. In prison, too, we seemed to have grown 
weak, but here it went much faster. There was already a ringing in the 
head. That pleasant weakness, in which it is easier to give in than to fight 
back, kept coming closer. 

And in the barracks—total darkness. We lay there dressed in 
everything wet on everything bare, and it seemed it was warmer not to 
take anything off-—like a poultice. 

Open eyes looked at the black ceiling, at the black heavens. 



The Hostile Brothers 355 


Good Lord! Good Lord! Beneath the shells and the bombs I begged 
you to preserve my life. And now I beg you, please send me death! 499 

It is reassuring to presume that the individuals who constructed, organized and ran the 
concentration camps of Germany and the Soviet Union were in some profound manner 
different from the people that we know, and love, and are. But there is no reason to make 
this presumption, except for convenience and naive peace of mind. 500 The image of the 
concentration camp guard, much as the inmate, defines the modern individual. Hell is a 
bottomless pit, and why? Because nothing is ever so bad that we cannot make it worse: 

Fire, fire! The branches crackle and the night wind of late autumn blows 
the flame of the bonfire back and forth. The compound is dark; I am alone 
at the bonfire, and I can bring it still some more carpenters’ shavings. The 
compound here is a privileged one, so privileged that is almost as if I were 
out in freedom—this is an Island of Paradise; this is the Marfino 
“sharashka”—a scientific institute staffed with prisoners—in its most 
privileged period. No one is overseeing me, calling me to a cell, chasing 
me away from the bonfire. I am wrapped in a padded jacket and even then 
it is chilly in the penetrating wind. 

But she —who has already been standing in the wind for hours, her 
arms straight down, her head drooping, weeping, then growing numb and 
still. And then again she begs piteously: “Citizen Chief! Forgive me! 

Please forgive me! I won’t do it again.” 

The wind carries her moan to me, just as if she were moaning next to 
my ear. The citizen chief at the gatehouse fires up his stove and does not 
answer. 

This was the gatehouse of the camp next door to us, from which 
workers came into our compound to lay water pipes and to repair the old 
ramshackle seminary building. Across from me, beyond the artfully 
intertwined, many-stranded barbed-wire barricade and two steps away 
from the gatehouse, beneath a bright lantern, stood the punished girl, head 
hanging, the wind tugging at her gray work skirt, her feet growing numb 
from the cold, a thin scarf over her head. It had been warm during the day, 
when they had been digging a ditch on our territory. And another girl, 
slipping down into a ravine, had crawled her way to the Vladykino 
Highway and escaped. The guard had bungled. And Moscow city buses 
ran right along the highway. When they caught on, it was too late to catch 
her. They raised the alarm. A mean, dark major arrived and shouted that if 
they failed to catch the girl, the entire camp would be deprived of visits 
and parcels for a whole month, because of her escape. And the women 
brigadiers went into a rage, and they were all shouting, one of them in 
particular, who kept viciously rolling her eyes: “Oh, I hope they catch her, 
the bitch! I hope they take scissors and—clip, clip, clip—take off all her 
hair in front of the line-up!” (This wasn’t something she had thought up 
herself. This was the way they punished women in the Gulag.) But the girl 
who was now standing outside the gatehouse in the cold had sighed and 



Maps of meaning 356 


said instead: “At least she can have a good time out in freedom for all of 
us!” The jailer overheard what she said, and now she was being punished; 
everyone else had been taken off to the camp, but she had been set outside 
there to stand “at attention” in front of the gatehouse. This had been at 6 
PM, and it was now 11 PM. She tried to shift from one foot to another, but 
the guard stuck out his head and shouted: “Stand at attention, whore, or 
else it will be worse for you!” And now she was not moving, only 
weeping: “Forgive me, Citizen Chief! Let me into the camp, I won’t do it 
any more!” 

But even in the camp no one was about to say to her: All right, idiot! 

Come on in! 

The reason they were keeping her out there so long was that the next 
day was Sunday, and she would not be needed for work. 

Such a straw-blond, naive, uneducated slip of a girl! She had been 
imprisoned for some spool of thread. What a dangerous thought you 
expressed there, little sister! They want to teach you a lesson for the rest 
of your life! 

Fire, fire! We fought the war—and we looked into the bonfires to see 
what kind of Victory it would be. The wind wafted a glowing husk from 
the bonfire. 

To that flame and you, girl, I promise: the whole wide world will read 
about you. 501 

Who would admit, even to himself: “given the choice, I would be the citizen chief, in 
preference to the punished girl?” And without this admission there is no reason to 
change, and no reason to combat the evil within: 

for whence 

But from the author of all ill could spring 
So deep a malice, to confound the race 
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell 
To mingle and involve, done all to spite 
The great Creator? 502 

Faced with the horror of camp life—“It too, is life”—many become corrupted: 

Let us admit the truth: At that great fork in the camp road, at that great 
divider of souls, it was not the majority of the prisoners that turned to the 
right. 503 

This corruption was not caused by camp conditions, appalling as they were: 

Bread is not issued in equal pieces, but thrown onto a pile—go grab! 

Knock down your neighbours, and tear it out of their hands! The quantity 
of bread issued is such that one or two people have to die for each that 
survives. The bread is hung up on a pine tree—go fell it. The bread is 



The Hostile Brothers 357 


deposited in a coal mine—go down and mine it. Can you think about your 
own grief, about the past and the future, about humanity and God? Your 
mind is absorbed in vain calculations which for the present moment cut 
you off from the heavens—and tomorrow are worth nothing. You hate 
labor—it is your principal enemy. You hate your companions—rivals in 
life and death. You are reduced to a frazzle by intense envy’ and alarm lest 
somewhere behind your back others are right now dividing up that bread 
which could be yours, that somewhere on the other side of the wall a tiny 
potato is being ladled out of the pot which could have ended up in your 
own bowl.' 04 

Such conditions merely provided the precondition for the emergence of the consequences 
of decisions already taken, prior to incarceration, in the large part—decisions to choose 
security instead of maintenance of conscience; to embrace safety instead of soul: 

In looking at the people, we might see 
that in the space twixt birth and death, 
one third follow life, and one third death, 
and those who merely pass from birth to death, 
are also one third of those we see. 505 

Greed and fear in the everyday world culminate in the same blind inability Solzhenitsyn 
recognized in the camps—the same incapacity to think about grief, about the past and 
future, about man and God—but with far less evident justification. Fear of mortality, in 
normal life, is most generally dealt with in the same manner as in the camp situation: 
through absolute identification with the system and consequent rejection of the self; 
through acceptance of ideological promise, offer of material security and guarantee of 
(unearned) intrapsychic stability: 

My friend Panin and I are lying on the middle shelf of a Stolypin 
compartment and have set ourselves up comfortably, tucked our salt 
herring in our pockets so we don’t need water and can go to sleep. But at 
some station or other they shove into our compartment.. .a Marxist 
scholar! We can even tell this from his goatee and spectacles. He doesn’t 
hide the fact: he is a former Professor of the Communist Academy. We 
hang head down in the square cutout—and from his very first words we 
see that he is: impenetrable. But we have been serving time for a long 
while, and have a long time left to serve, and we value a merry joke. We 
must climb down to have a bit of fun! There is ample space left in the 
compartment, and so we exchange places with someone and crowd in: 

“Hello.” 

“Hello.” 

“You’re not too crowded?” 

“No, it’s all right.” 

“Have you been in the jug a long time?” 

“Long enough.” 



Maps of meaning 358 


“Are you past the halfway mark?” 

“Just.” 

“Look over there: how poverty-stricken our villages are—straw thatch, 
crooked huts.” 

“An inheritance from the Tsarist regime.” 

“Well, but we’ve already had thirty Soviet years.” 

“That’s an insignificant period historically.” 

“It’s terrible that the collective farmers are starving.” 

“But have you looked in all their ovens?” 

“Just ask any collective farmer in our compartment.” 

“Everyone in jail is embittered and prejudiced.” 

“But I’ve seen collective farms myself.” 

“That means they were uncharacteristic.” 

(The goatee had never been in any of them—that way it was simpler.) 

“Just ask the old folks: under the Tsar they were well fed, well clothed, 
and they used to have so many holidays.” 

“I’m not even going to ask. It’s a subjective trait of human memory to 
praise everything in the past. The cow that died is the one that gave twice 
the milk. (Sometimes he even cited proverbs!) And our people don’t like 
holidays. They like to work.” 

“But why is there a shortage of bread in many cities?” 

“When?” 

“Right before the war, for example.” 

“Not true! Before the war, in fact, everything had been worked out.” 

“Listen, at that time in all the cities on the Volga there were queues of 
thousands of people...” 

“Some local failure in supply. But more likely your memory is failing 
you.” 

“But there’s a shortage now!” 

“Old wives’ tales. We have from seven to eight billion poods of grain.” 

“And the grain itself is rotten.” 

“Not at all. We have been successful in developing new varieties of 
grain.”... 

And so forth. He is imperturbable. He speaks in a language which 
requires no effort of the mind. And arguing with him is like walking 
through a desert. 

It’s about people like that that they say: “He made the rounds of all the 
smithies and came home unshod.” And when they write in their 
obituaries: “perished tragically during the period of the cult,” this should 
be corrected to read: “perished comically.” 

But if his fate had worked out differently, we would never have learned 
what a dry, insignificant little man he was. We would have respectfully 
read his name in the newspaper. He would have become a people’s 
commissar or even ventured to represent all Russia abroad. 

To argue with him was useless. It was much more interesting to play 
with him.. .no, not at chess, but at the game of “comrades.” There really is 



The Hostile Brothers 359 


such a game. It is a very simple game. Just play up to him a couple of 
times or so, use some of his own pet words and phrases. He will like it. 
For he has grown accustomed to find that all around him...are enemies. 
He has become weary of snarling and doesn’t like to tell his stories 
because all those stories will be twisted around and thrown right back in 
his face. But if he takes you for one of his own, he will quite humanly 
disclose to you what he has seen at the station: People are passing by, 
talking, laughing, life goes on. The Party is providing leadership, people 
are being moved from job to job. Yet you and I are languishing here in 
prison, there are a handful of us, and we must write and write petitions, 
begging a review of our cases, begging for a pardon.... 

Or else he will tell you something interesting: In the Communist 
Academy they decided to devour one comrade; they decided he wasn’t 
quite genuine, not one of our own; but somehow they couldn’t manage it: 
there were no errors in his essays, and his biography was clean. Then all 
of a sudden, going through the archives, what a find! They ran across an 
old brochure written by this comrade which Vladimir Ilyich Lenin himself 
had held in his hands and in the margin of which he had written in his 
own handwriting the notation: “As an economist he is shit.” “Well now, 
you understand,” our companion smiled confidentially, “that after that it 
was no trouble at all to make short work of that muddlehead and impostor. 
He was expelled from the Academy and deprived of his scholarly rank.” 

The railroad cars go clicking along. Everyone is already asleep, some 
lying down, some sitting up. Sometimes a convoy guard passes along the 
corridor, yawning. 

And one more unrecorded episode from Lenin’s biography is lost from 


Human life is bounded on all fronts by vulnerability, is eternally subject to fear for lack 
of resources and security of person. Moral knowledge, knowledge of good and evil, is the 
capability to choose pattern of adaptation—authoritarian, decadent or creative—in the 
face of mortal limitation, explicit and implicit, in camp, and outside: 

Those people became corrupted in camp who had already been corrupted 
out in freedom or who were ready for it. Because people are corrupted in 
freedom too, sometimes even more effectively than in camp. 

The convoy officer who ordered that Moiseyevaite be tied to a post in 
order to be mocked—had he not been corrupted more profoundly than the 
camp inmates who spat on her? 

And for that matter did every one of the brigade members spit on her? 
Perhaps only two from each brigade did. In fact, that is probably what 
happened. 

Tatyana Falike writes: “Observation of people convinced me that no 
man could become a scoundrel in camp if he had not been one before.”

If a person went swiftly bad in camp, what it might mean was that he 
had not just gone bad, but that that inner foulness which had not 
previously been needed had disclosed itself. 

Voichenko has his opinion: “In camp, existence did not determine 
consciousness, but just the opposite: consciousness and steadfast faith in 
the human essence decided whether you became an animal or remained a 
human being.” 

A drastic, sweeping declaration!.. .But he was not the only one who 
thought so. The artist Ivashev-Musatov passionately argued exactly the 
same thing. 507 

This corruption—this turning to the left—led some to dissolve, to decay; to fall into the 
sickness unto death, despair; to embrace death, with final hope—necessary faith— 
irrevocably, understandably crushed and shattered: 

The prisoner who had lost faith in the future—his future—was doomed. 

With his loss of belief in the future, he also lost his spiritual hold; he let 
himself decline and became subject to mental and physical decay. 
Usually, this happened quite suddenly, in the form of a crisis, the 
symptoms of which were familiar to the experienced camp inmate. We all 
feared this moment—not for ourselves, which would have been pointless, 
but for our friends. Usually it began with the prisoner refusing one 
morning to get dressed and wash to to go out on the parade grounds. No 
entreaties, no blows, no threats had any effect. He just lay there, hardly 
moving. If this crisis was brought about by an illness, he refused to be 
taken to the sick-bay or to do anything to help himself. He simply gave 
up. There he remained, lying in his own excreta, and nothing bothered 
him anymore. 

I once had a dramatic demonstration of the close link between the loss 

of faith in the future and this dangerous giving up. F-, my senior 

block warden, a fairly well-known composer and librettist, confided in me 
one day: “I would like to tell you something, Doctor. I have had a strange 
dream. A voice told me that I could wish for something, that I should only 
say what I wanted to know, and all my questions would be answered. 

What do you think I asked? That I would like to know when the war 
would be over for me. You know what I mean, Doctor—for me! I wanted 
to know, when we, when our camp, would be liberated and our sufferings 
come to an end.” 

“And when did you have this dream?” I asked. 

“In February, 1945,” he answered. It was then the beginning of March. 

“What did your dream voice answer?” 

Furtively he whispered to me, “March thirtieth.” 

When F-told me about this dream, he was still full of hope and 

convinced that the voice of his dream would be right. But as the promised 
day drew nearer, the war news which reached our camp made it appear 
very unlikely that we would be free on the promised date. On March 



The Hostile Brothers 361 


twenty-ninth, F-suddenly became ill and ran a high temperature. On 

March thirtieth, the day his prophecy had told him that the war would be 
over for him, he became delirious and lost consciousness. On March 
thirty-first, he was dead. To all appearances, he had died of typhus. 508 

Other camp victims, by contrast—but equally comprehensibly—chose to identify with 
the camp authorities, when allowed such honor, and therefore arrayed themselves against 
those who shared their fate, those who were also starved and deprived, frightened and 
worked to exhaustion. The persecution of others presents no difficulty—is, in fact, 
inevitable—in the wake of bondage and persecution of the self. Frankl states: 

The process of selecting Capos [trustees] was a negative one; only the 
most brutal of the prisoners were chosen for this job (although there were 
some happy exceptions). But apart from the selection of Capos which was 
undertaken by the SS, there was a sort of self-selecting process going on 
the whole time among all of the prisoners. 

On the average, only those prisoners could keep alive who, after years 
of trekking from camp to camp, had lost all scruples in their fight for 
existence; they were prepared to use every means, honest and otherwise, 
even brutal force, theft, and betrayal of their friends, in order to save 
themselves.. ,. 509 

Many of the Capos fared better in the camp than they had in their entire 
lives. Often they were harder on the prisoners than were the guards, and 
beat them more cruelly than the SS men did. 510 

Likewise, Solzhenitsyn: 

You—had fallen. You—were punished. You—had been uprooted from 
life—but you want to avoid the very bottom of the pile? You want to 
hover over someone else, rifle in hand? Over your brother? Here! Take it! 

And if he runs—shoot him! We will even call you comrade. And we will 
give you a Red Army man’s ration. 

And...he grows proud. And...he tightens his grip on his gun stock. 

And...he shoots. And... he is even more severe than the free guards. 

(How is one to understand this: Was it really a purblind faith in social 
initiative? Or was it just an icy, contemptuous calculation based on the 
lowest human feelings?) 511 

Most camp inmates were normal, well-adapted members of society before their 
imprisonment. These normal people had identified with the structure and successes of 
that society, with its definitions of present and ideal future, with its means to its ends. 
Unjust incarceration meant loss of status, heightened fear of morality; demonstrated as 
nothing else could the evidently pathological operations of the state, constructed in theory 
precisely to protect against such deprivation and anxiety. Unjust incarceration presented 
anomaly sufficient in its fundamental import to undermine faith in previous 
identification, to demonstrate the incomplete, or even corrupt, nature of previous status. 



Maps of meaning 362 


to foster anxiety, depression and desire, often realized, for dissolution and death. How 
could such a threat be countered? 

Conscious, rationalized denial of evident injustice made social identification possible 
once again—but at the cost of substantial intrapsychic damage, dissociation. The lie 
involved meant sacrifice of more personal experience, more individual possibility, more 
divine meaning to the group. The inevitable result of such sacrifice—the sin against the 
Holy Spirit—is fanatical adherence to the letter of the law— 

Farewell happy Fields 

Where Joy for ever dwells: Hail horrors, hail 
Infernal world, and thou profoundest Hell 
Receive thy new possessor—one who brings 
A mind not to be changed by place or time. 512 

is fidelity to the lie— 

Farewell remorse! All good to me is lost 
Evil, be thou my Good: by thee at least 
Divided empire with Heaven’s King I hold, 

By thee, and more than half perhaps will reign; 

As Man erelong, and this new World, shall know. 

Thus while he spake, each passion dimmed his face, 

Thrice changed with pale ire, envy and despair.

allegiance to cruelty and deceit— 

Oh why should wrath be mute and fury dumb? 

I am no baby, I, that with base prayers 
I should repent the evils I have done. 

Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did

If one good deed in all my life I did, 

I do repent it from my very soul.' 14 

and hatred of the good: 

The more I see 

Pleasures about me, so much more I feel 



The Hostile Brothers 363 


Torment within me, as from the hateful siege 

Of contraries; all good to me becomes 

Bane, and in Heaven much worse would be my state, 

But neither here seek I, no, nor in Heaven, 

To dwell, unless by mastering Heaven’s Supreme, 

Nor hope to be myself less miserable 
By what I seek, but others to make such 
As I, though thereby worse to me redound: 

For only in destroying I find ease 
To my relentless thoughts. 515 

Human beings are emotionally attached to those whom with they identify; sympathy for 
the victim of injustice means inability to perpetrate such injustice. Identification with 
tyranny, on the other hand, means temporary effortless surcease from painful (intra- and 
extrapsychic) moral conflict. Such identification merely requires denial of the injustice 
committed to one’s own person, and the subsequent falsification of individual experience. 
This falsification cuts the empathic bonds, connecting prisoner to prisoner, connecting 
man to man, connecting man to himself: 

I shall despair. There is no creature loves me; 

And if I die, no soul will pity me: 

Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself 
Find in myself no pity to myself. 516 

The victim who finds personal security in identity with his persecutor has become that 
persecutor. He has eliminated the possibility of further adaptation, integration and 
growth, and has voluntarily forfeited possibility of redemption. Solzhenitsyn describes 
the reactions and actions of staunch Communist Party members, imprisoned and 
devoured by the system they supported and produced: 

To say that things were painful for them is to say almost nothing. They 
were incapable of assimilating such a blow, such a downfall, and from 
their own people, too, from their own dear Party, and, from all 
appearances, for nothing at all. After all, they had been guilty of nothing 
as far as the Party was concerned—nothing at all. It was painful for them 
to such a degree that it was considered taboo among them, uncomradely, 
to ask: “What were you imprisoned for?” The only squeamish generation 
of prisoners! The rest of us, in 1945, with tongues hanging out, used to 
recount our arrests, couldn’t wait to tell the story to every chance 
newcomer we met and to the whole cell—as if it were an anecdote. 

Here’s the sort of people they were. Olga Sliozberg’s husband had 
already been arrested, and they had come to carry out a search and arrest 
her too. The search lasted four hours—and she spent those four hours 
sorting out the minutes of the congress of Stakhanovites of the bristle and 
brush industry, of which she had been the secretary until the previous day. 

The incomplete state of the minutes troubled her more than her children, 



Maps of meaning 364 


whom she was now leaving forever! Even the interrogator conducting the 
search could not resist telling her: “Come on now, say farewell to your 
children!” 

Here’s the sort of people they were. A letter from her fifteen-year old 
daughter came to Yelizaveta Tsetkova in the Kazan Prison for long-term 
prisoners: “Mama! Tell me, write to me—are you guilty or not? I hope 
you weren’t guilty, because then I won’t join the Komsomol [a Soviet 
youth organization], and I won’t forgive them because of you. But if you 
are guilty—I won’t write you any more and will hate you.” And the 
mother was stricken by remorse in her damp gravelike cell with its dim 
little lamp: How could her daughter live without the Komsomol? How 
could she be permitted to hate Soviet power? Better that she should hate 
me. And she wrote: “I am guilty.... Enter the Komsomol!” 

How could it be anything but hard! It was more than the human heart 
could bear: to fall beneath the beloved axe—then to have to justify its 
wisdom. But that is the price a man pays for entrusting his God-given soul 
to human dogma. Even today any orthodox Communist will affirm that 
Tsetkova acted correctly. Even today they cannot be convinced that this is 
precisely the “perversion of small forces,” that the mother perverted her 
daughter and harmed her soul. 

Here’s the sort of people they were: Y.T. gave sincere testimony 
against her husband—anything to aid the Party! 

Oh, how one could pity them if at least now they had come to 
comprehend their former wretchedness! This whole chapter could have 
been written quite differently if today at least they had forsaken their 
earlier views! 

But it happened the way Mariya Danielyan had dreamed it would: “If I 
leave here someday, I am going to live as if nothing had taken place.” 

Loyalty? And in our view it is just plain pigheadedness. These 
devotees to the theory of development construed loyalty to that 
development to mean renunciation of any personal development 
whatsoever! As Nikolai Adamovich Vilenchuk said, after serving 
seventeen years: “We believed in the Party—and we were not mistaken !” 

Is this loyalty or pigheadedness? 

No, it was not for show and not out of hypocrisy that they argued in the 
cells in defense of all the government’s actions. They needed ideological 
arguments in order to hold on to a sense of their own rightness— 
otherwise, insanity was not far off. 517 

“The evidence is intolerable—so much the worse for the evidence!” The hero, the savior, 
is metaphorical or narrative description of the pattern by which the existence of 
anomalous information is accepted, mined for significance, and incorporated into the 
body of cultural adaptation. The devil, incarnation of evil, is embodiment, in procedure, 
episode and word, of the tendency that denies, rather than accepts; embodiment of the 
process that consciously inhibits life and its development, and brings to a halt the spirit’s 
revolutionary process of adaptation: 



The Hostile Brothers 365 


Just tell us one thing: Who laid the bricks, who laid the bricks in the wall? 

Was it you, you hard-heads? 518 

Ideology confines human potential to a narrow and defined realm. Adaptation undertaken 
within that realm necessarily remains insufficient, destined to produce misery—as it is 
only relationship with the transcendent that allows life to retain its savor. Ideology says 
“it must be thus,” but human behavior constantly exceeds its realm of representation; 
such capacity for exception must therefore be denied, lest faith in ideology vanish, and 
intolerable chaos reappear. The ideologue says: anomaly means dissolution, dissolution 
means terror—that which frightens is evil: anomaly is evil. It is not the existence of 
anomalous information that constitutes evil, however—such information rejuvenates, 
when properly consumed. Evil is the process by which the significance of the anomaly is 
denied; the process by which meaning itself—truth itself—is rejected. This rejection 
means, necessarily, life rendered unbearable, hellish: 

For now the thought 

Both of lost happiness and lasting pain 

Torments him: round he throws his baleful eyes, 

That witnessed huge affliction and dismay, 

Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate; 

At once, as far as angel’s ken, he views 
The dismal situation waste and wild; 

A dungeon horrible, on all sides round, 

As one great furnace flamed, yet from these flames 
No light, but rather darkness visible 
Served only to discover sights of woe, 

Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace 
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes 
That comes to all, but torture without end 
Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed 
With ever-burning sulphur unconsumed. 

Such place Eternal Justice had prepared 
For those rebellious, here their prison ordained 
In utter darkness, and their portion set, 

As far removed from God and light of Heaven 
As from the center thrice to the utmost pole. 519 

The fact, regardless of content, is not evil; it is mere (terrible) actuality. It is the attitude 
to the fact that has a moral or immoral nature. There are no evil facts—although there 
are facts about evil; it is denial of the unacceptable fact that constitutes evil—at least 
insofar as human control extends. The suppression of unbearable fact transforms the 
conservative tendency to preserve into the authoritarian tendency to crush; transforms the 
liberal wish to transform into the decadent desire to subvert. Confusing evil with the 
unbearable fact, rather than with the tendency to deny the fact, is like equating the good 
with the static product of heroism, rather than with the dynamic act of heroism itself. 
Confusion of evil with the fact—the act of blaming the messenger—merely provides 



Maps of meaning 366 


rationale for the act of denial, justification for savage repression, and mask of morality 
for decadence and authoritarianism. 

Denial of (anomalous) experience eliminates possibility of growth; culminates in 
establishment of a personality whose weakness in the face of inevitable tragic 
circumstance and suffering produces desire for annihilation of life. Repression of fact— 
of truth—ensures deterioration of personality; assures transformation of subjective 
experience into endless meaningless sterility and misery. Acceptance, by contrast—in the 
spirit of ignorant humility, courage disguised—provides the necessary precondition for 
change. 

Myth offers an imitative schema for the generation of such acceptance—for 
development of the ability to adapt—through encouragement of identification with the 
hero, whose form is constantly represented in ethical behavior, portrayed in ritual and 
described in narrative. The story of the hero is symbolic depiction of the man who 
chooses the third way, when confronted by facts whose significance undermines personal 
or social stability—who risks intrapsychic dissolution as voluntarily chosen alternative to 
adoption of tyranny or acceptance of decadence. Failure to adopt such identification 
ensures constant restriction of action and imagination; generates hatred, cruelty, disgust 
for the weak; assures adoption of the lie as prime, and perhaps most common, adaptive 
strategy. Such adoption inevitably transforms human experience into hell on earth: 

Him the Almighty Power 

Hurled headlong flaming from the ethereal Sky 

With hideous ruin and combustion down 

To bottomless perdition, there to dwell 

In adamantine chains and penal fire. 520 

The definitions of moral and immoral accepted by the members of a given society remain 
dependent upon the conceptualization of the way accepted by that society. From within 
the confines of a particular conceptualization, certain behaviors, productions of the 
imagination and ideas are attributed status of good and status of evil, in accordance with 
their perceived utility, with regard to a particular goal. Any act or idea that interferes with 
current individual desire becomes the fool, or worse—the enemy. This means that if the 
individual or the group desires anything more than to live in the light, so to speak, then 
truth and wisdom necessarily become foreign, abhorrent. What may be regarded as useful 
and necessary from a higher order of morality may look positively useless and 
counterproductive from a lower—and will come to be treated in that manner. So the 
individual (or the attribute) that is serving such a higher function may well appear 
contaminated by the dragon of chaos to those who have not yet seen or who will not 
admit to the necessity and desirability of that function. Such devaluation of the 
“revolutionary best” dooms the individual and those he can affect to weakness and 
misery. Restricted and narrow goals produce warped and stunted personalities, who have 
cast the best within them into the domain of anomaly—defining their true talents and 
“deviances” as (threatening and frustrating) impediments to their too-narrow ambitions. 
The stunted personality will experience life as a burden, a responsibility too heavy to 
bear, and turn to resentment and hatred as “justifiable” responses. 



The Hostile Brothers 367 


Reconceptualization of the way, by contrast, means revaluation of behavior, episode 
and semantic proposition, so that a new order might exist; means uncomfortable return to 
chaos, however, prior to the reconstruction of that more inclusive order. Re-evaluation of 
the goal, of the ideal undertaken voluntarily, as a consequence of exposure to anomalous 
information, may bring suppressed material, action potential, imagination and thought, 
back to light. The shift toward conceptualization of the process of heroism as goal—to 
valuation of truth, courage and love—allows for reincorporation and subsequent 
development of hitherto repressed, stunted and pathologized possibilities: 

The great epochs of our lives come when we gain the courage to 
rechristen our evil as what is best in us. 521 

This is not to say, stupidly, that all motivational states—or all facts, or all behavioral 
possibilities—are equally “beneficial,” in all situations. It is rather that our acts of self- 
definition (many of which have an “arbitrary” cultural grounding) determine what we are 
willing to accept, at any given place and moment, as “good” and as “evil.” The self- 
sacrificing domestic martyr, for example, who accepts her husband’s every authoritarian 
demand—she has defined her capacity for violence as ethically unsuitable, and will 
regard it as something forbidden and evil. This makes aggression something 
contaminated by the dragon of chaos, from the martyr’s perspective. She will therefore 
remain a miserable doormat, unless she learns to bite—which means, until she drops her 
present all-too-restrictive “easygoing and affectionate” stance (which is not doing her 
husband any good, either, by reinforcing his weak, fascistic tendencies; nor improving 
the society of which her marriage is a part. Her inability to be angry—which is, in reality, 
her inability to regard herself as possessed of intrinsic worth—removes necessary 
limitations to her husband’s inappropriate and socially dangerous expansion of power). It 
is thus the “unsuitable desire” that is often precisely what is necessary to lift us beyond 
our present uncomfortable stasis. This does not mean simpleminded application of a 
poorly designed strategy of “previously repressed” motivated behavior. It means, instead, 
true integration of what has not yet been expressed—or even admitted—into the structure 
of harmonious intrapsychic and social relations: 

Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbour, and 
hate thine enemy. 

But I say unto you. Love your enemies, bless them that curse you, do 
good to them that hate you, and pray for them which despitefiilly use you, 
and persecute you; 

That ye may be the children of your Father which is in heaven: for he 
maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good, and sendeth rain on the 
just and on the unjust. 

For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even 
the publicans the same? 

And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye more [than others]? do 
not even the publicans so? 

Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is 
perfect. (Matthew 5:43-48) 



Maps of meaning 368 


The adoption of a particular (socially determined) conceptualization of the way allows for 
provisional establishment of the meaning of experiences—objects, situations and 
processes. The nature of the goal toward which action and ideation is devoted, in the 
ideal, determines what behaviors and products of imagination and abstract thought come 
to be regarded as acceptable, and are therefore developed, and which are forbidden, and 
are therefore left repressed and stunted. If the individual or social ideal remains 
undeveloped, immature in conceptualization, or twisted in the course of development, 
then aspects of behavior and cognition necessary for redemption—for deliverance from 
the unbearable weight of tragic self-consciousness—will be suppressed, with intrapsychic 
and social pathology as the inevitable result. If the individual strives primarily for 
material security, or social acceptance, rather than for the mythic love of God and fellow 
man, then respect for truth will suffer, and complete adaptation will become impossible. 

And when he was gone forth into the way, there came one running, and 
kneeled to him, and asked him, Good Master, what shall I do that I may 
inherit eternal life? 

And Jesus said unto him, Why callest thou me good? there is none 
good but one, that is, God. 

Thow knowest the commmandments, Do not commit adultery, Do not 
kill. Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Defraud not. Honour thy 
father and mother. 

And he answered and said unto him, Master, all these have I observed 
from my youth. 

Then Jesus beholding him loved him, and said unto him, One thing 
thou lackest: go thy way, sell whatsoever thou hast, and give to the poor, 
and thou shalt have treasure in heaven: and come, take up the cross, and 
follow me. 

And he was sad at that saying, and went away grieved: for he had great 
possessions. 

And Jesus looked round about, and saith unto his disciples, How hardly 
shall they that have riches enter into the kingdom of God! 

And the disciples were astonished at his words. But Jesus answereth 
again, and saith unto them, Children, how hard is it for them that trust in 
riches to enter into the kingdom of God! 

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich 
man to enter into the kingdom of God. 

And they were astonished out of measure, saying among themselves, 

Who then can be saved? (Mark 10:17-26) 

The highest value toward which effort is devoted determines what will become elevated, 
and what subjugated, in the course of individual and social existence. If security or power 
is valued above all else, then all will become subject to the philosophy of expedience. In 
the long term, adoption of such a policy leads to development of rigid, weak personality 
(or social environment) or intrapsychic dissociation and social chaos: 



The Hostile Brothers 369 


Jesus said, “A man had received visitors. And when he had prepared the 
dinner, he sent his servant to invite the guest. He went to the first one and 
said to him, ‘My master invites you.’ He said, ‘I have some claims against 
some merchants. They are coming to me this evening. I must go and give 
them my orders. I ask to be excused from the dinner.’ He went to another 
and said to him, ‘My master has invited you.’ He said to him, ‘I have just 
bought a house and am required for the day. I shall not have any spare 
time.’ He sent to another and said to him, ‘My master invites you.’ He 
said to him, ‘My friend is going to get married, and I am to prepare the 
banquet. I shall not be able to come. I ask to be excused from the dinner. ’ 

He went to another and said to him, ‘I have just bought a farm, and I am 
on my way to collect the rent. I shall not be able to come. I ask to be 
excused.’ The servant returned and said to his master, ‘Those whom you 
invited to the dinner have asked to be excused.’ The master said to his 
servants, ‘Go outside to the streets and bring back those whom you 
happen to meet, so that they may dine.’ Businessmen and merchants [will] 
not enter the places of my father.” 522 

A man who has put his faith in what he owns, rather than what he stands for, will be 
unable to sacrifice what he owns, for what he is. He will necessarily choose—when the 
re-emergence of uncertainty forces choice —what he has gathered around him instead of 
what he could be. This decision will weaken his nature and make him unable to cope with 
the tragic weight of his consciousness; it will turn him toward the lie and make him an 
active agent in production of his own and his society’s insufficiency. 

If the goal toward which behavior is devoted remains pathologically restricted—if the 
highest ideal remains, for example, sensual pleasure, social acceptance, power or material 
security—then aspects of behavior and ideation which exist in conflict to these goals will 
become pathologically twisted in orientation, because forced to serve a contemptible 
master; will be defined as evil, left undeveloped in consequence, and remain unavailable 
for use in more potentially inclusive redemptive activity; will become subjugated, 
suppressed, and stagnant. This lack of development and associated sickening will 
decrease adaptive flexibility, in the face of the true challenges of life; will ensure that 
life’s challenges appear devastating. The myth of the way, which describes human 
experience itself, encompasses loss of paradise, emergence of tragedy and then, 
redemption—and it is the fool, the true individual, who is in desperate need of 
redemption. To identify with the group is to deny the fool— 

Then shall they also answer him, saying, Lord, when saw I Thee an 
htmgred, or athirst, or a stranger, or naked, or sick, or in prison, and did 
not minister unto thee? 

Then shall He answer them, saying, Verily I say unto you. Inasmuch as 
ye did it not to one of the least of these, ye did it not to Me. (Matthew 
25:44-45) 


and to therefore lose all hope.

We have a model of ourselves, in imagination and semantic representation, which is in 
ill accord with the actuality of ourselves, in procedure, imaginative capacity and potential 
for thought. This lack of isomorphism, this willful lack of attention to truth, means that 
behavior and potential thereof exist, which is anomalous with regard to the ideal of 
behavior in representation—“I couldn’t do that”; that episodic capacity and content exist, 
which is anomalous to the ideal of such capability and content in representation—“I 
couldn’t imagine that”; and that semantic ability and content exists, which is anomalous 
with regard to the ideal of semantic ability and content, in representation—“I couldn’t 
think that.” Pathological use of this model (the replacement of actuality, with an 
insufficient idea, conceptualized in fantasy) restricts adaptation to the unexpected—to 
change itself. This means existence in boundless and ever-expanding misery: 

Which way I fly is Hell; myself am Hell; 

And in the lowest deep a lower deep 
Still threatening to devour me opens wide, 

To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven. 52 ’ 

The devil, traditional representation of evil, refuses recognition of imperfection, refuses 
to admit “I was in error, in my action, in my representation”; accepts, as a consequence of 
unbending pride, eternal misery—refuses metanoia, confession and reconciliation; 
remains forever the spirit that refuses and rejects: 

O, then at last relent; is there no place 
Left for repentance, none for pardon left? 

None left but by submission; and that word 
Disdain forbids me, and my dread of shame 
Among the Spirits beneath, whom I seduced 
With other promises and other vaunts 
Than to submit, boasting I could subdue 
The Omnipotent. Ay me! they little know 
How dearly I abide that boast so vain. 

Under what torments inwardly I groan; 

While they adore me on the throne of Hell, 

With diadem and sceptre high advanced, 

The lower still I fall, only supreme 
In misery—such joy ambition finds! 

But say I could repent, and could obtain. 

By act of grace, my former state; how soon 
Should height recall high thoughts, how soon unsay 
What feigned submission swore; ease would recant 
Vows made in pain, as violent and void— 

For never can true reconcilement grow 

Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep: 

Which would but lead me to a worse relapse, 

And heavier fall: so should I purchase dear 
Short intermission bought with double smart. 



The Hostile Brothers 371 


This knows my Punisher; therefore as far 
From granting he, as I from begging, peace: 

All hope excluded thus. 524 

Such refusal—the inability to say, “I was wrong, I am sorry, I should change,” means the 
death of hope, existence in the abyss. Rejection of fact means alienation from God, from 
meaning, from truth—and life without meaning is suffering without recourse, worthy of 
nothing but destruction, in accordance with self-definition. Frye states: 

The way of life is described as beginning in metanoia, a word translated 
“repentance” by the [Authorized Version], which suggests a moralized 
inhibition of the “stop doing everything you want to do” variety. What the 
word primarily means, however, is change of outlook or spiritual 
metamorphosis, an enlarged vision of the dimensions of human life. Such 
a vision, among other things, detaches one from one’s primary community 
and attaches him to another. When John the Baptist says “Bring forth 
fruits worthy of metanoia ” (Matthew 3:8) he is addressing Jews, and goes 
on to say that their primary social identity (descent from Abraham) is of 
no spiritual importance.... 

The dialectic of metanoia and sin splits the world into the kingdom of 
genuine identity, presented as Jesus’ “home,” and a hell, a conception 
found in the Old Testament only in the form of death or the grave. Hell is 
that, but it is also the world of anguish and torment that man goes on 
making for himself all through history. 525 

The act of metanoia is adaptation itself: admission of error, founded on faith in ability to 
tolerate such admission and its consequences; consequential dissolution, subjugation to 
the “hateful siege of contraries, and —Deo concedente —restoration of intrapsychic and 
interpersonal integrity: 

As soon as you have renounced that aim of “surviving at any price,” and 
gone where the calm and simple people go—then imprisonment begins to 
transform your former character in an astonishing way. To transform it in 
a direction most unexpected to you. 

And it would seem that in this situation feelings of malice, the 
disturbance of being oppressed, aimless hate, irritability, and nervousness 
ought to multiply. But you yourself do not notice how, with the 
impalpable flow of time, slavery nurtures in you the shoots of 
contradictory feelings. 

Once upon a time you were sharply intolerant. You were constantly in 
a rush. And you were constantly short of time. And now you have time 
with interest. You are surfeited with it, with its months and years, behind 
you and ahead of you—and a beneficial calming fluid pours through your 
blood vessels—patience. 

You are ascending.... 



Maps of meaning 372 


Formerly you never forgave anyone. You judged people without 
mercy. And you praised people with equal lack of moderation. And now 
an understanding mildness has become the basis of your uncategorical 
judgments. You have come to realize your own weakness—and you can 
therefore understand the weakness of others. And be astonished at 
another’s strength. And wish to possess it yourself. 

The stones rustle beneath our feet. We are ascending.... 

With the years, armor-plated restraint covers your heart and all your 
skin. You do not hasten to question and you do not hasten to answer. Your 
tongue has lost its flexible capacity for easy oscillation. Your eyes do not 
flash with gladness over good tidings, nor do they darken with grief. 

For you still have to verify whether that’s how it is going to be. And 
you also have to work out—what is gladness, and what is grief. 

And now the rule of your life is this: do not rejoice when you have 
found, do not weep when you have lost. 

Your soul, which formerly was dry, now ripens from suffering. And 
even if you haven’t come to love your neighbours in the Christian sense, 
you are at least learning to love those close to you. 

Those close to you in spirit who surround you in slavery. And how 
many of us come to realize: It is particularly in slavery that for the first 
time we have learned to recognize genuine friendship! 

And also those close to you in blood, who surrounded you in your 
former life, who loved you—while you played the tyrant over them.... 

Here is a rewarding and inexhaustible direction for your thoughts: 
Reconsider all your previous life. Remember everything you did that was 
bad and shameful and take thought—can’t you possibly correct it now? 

Yes, you have been imprisoned for nothing. You have nothing to 
repent of before the state and its laws. 

But...before your own conscience? But...in relation to other 
individuals? 526 

Refusal of metanoia means inevitable intermixture of Earth and the underworld; 
conscientious acceptance, by contrast, produces a characteristic transformation of 
personality, of action, imagination and thought. Frankl states: 

We who lived in concentration camps can remember the men who walked 
through the huts comforting others, giving away their last piece of bread. 

They may have been few in number, they they offer sufficient proof that 
everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human 
freedoms—to choose one’s attitude in any given set of circumstances, to 
choose one’s own way. 

And there were always choices to make. Every day, every hour, offered 
the opportunity to make a decision, a decision which determined whether 
you would or would not submit to those powers which threatened to rob 
you of your very self, your inner freedom; which determined whether or 



The Hostile Brothers 373 


not you would become the plaything of circumstance, renouncing freedom 
and dignity to become moulded into the form of the typical inmate. 527 

Solzhenitsyn echoes these sentiments, almost precisely: 

And how can one explain that certain unstable people found faith right 
there in the camp, that they were strengthened by it, and that they survived 
un corrupted? 

And many more, scattered about and unnoticed, came to their alloted 
turning point and made no mistake in their choice. Those who managed to 
see that things were not only bad for them, but even worse, even harder, 
for their neighbours. 

And all those who, under the threat of a penalty zone and a new term of 
imprisonment, refused to become stoolies? 

How, in general, can one explain Grigory Ivanovich Grigoryev, a soil 
scientist? A scientist who volunteered for the People’s Volunteer Corps in 
1941—and the rest of the story is a familiar one. Taken prisoner near 
Vyazma, he spent his whole captivity in a German camp. And the 
subsequent story is also familiar. When he returned, he was arrested by us 
and given a tenner. I came to know him in winter, engaged in general 
work in Ekibastuz. His forthrightness gleamed from his big quiet eyes, 
some sort of unwavering forthrightness. This man was never able to bow 
in spirit. And he didn’t bow in camp, either, even though he worked only 
two of his ten years in his own field of specialization, and didn’t receive 
food parcels from home for nearly the whole term. He was subjected on 
all sides to the camp philosophy, to the camp corruption of soul, but he 
was incapable of adopting it. In the Kemerovo camps (Antibess) the 
security chief kept trying to recruit him as a stoolie. Grigoryev replied to 
him quite honestly and candidly: “I find it quite repulsive to talk to you. 
You will find many willing without me.” “You bastard, you’11 crawl on all 
fours.” “I would be better hanging myself from the first branch.” And so 
he was sent off to a penalty situation. He stood it for about half a year. 
And he made mistakes which were even more unforgivable: When he was 
sent on an agricultural work party, he refused (as a soil scientist) to accept 
the post of brigadier offered him. He hoed and scythed with enthusiasm. 
And even more stupidly: in Ekibastuz at the stone quarry he refused to be 
a work checker—only because he would have had to pad the work sheets 
for the sloggers, for which, later on, when they caught up with it, the 
eternally drunk free foreman would have to pay the penalty (but would 
he?). And so he went to break rocks! His honesty was so monstrously 
unnatural that when he went out to process potatoes with the vegetable 
storeroom brigade, he did not steal any, though everyone else did. When 
he was in a good post, in the privileged repair-shop brigade at the 
pumping-station equipment, he left simply because he refused to wash the 
socks of the free bachelor construction supervisor, Treivish. (His fellow 
brigade members tried to persuade him: Come on now, isn’t it all the 



Maps of meaning 374 


same, the kind of work you do? But no, it turned out it was not at all the 
same to him!) How many times did he select the worst and hardest lot, 
just so as not to have to offend against his conscience—and he didn’t, not 
in the least, and I am a witness. And even more: because of the astounding 
influence on his body of his bright and spotless human spirit (though no 
one today believes in any such influence, no one understands it) the 
organism of Grigory Ivanovich, who was no longer young (close to fifty), 
grew stronger in camp; his earlier rheumatism of the joints disappeared 
completely, and he became particularly healthy after the typhus from 
which he recovered: in winter, he went out in cotton sacks, making holes 
in them for his head and his arms—and he did not catch cold! 328 

The process of voluntary engagement in the “revaluation of good and evil,” consequent to 
recognition of personal insufficiency and suffering, is equivalent to adoption of 
identification with Horus (who, as the process that renews, exists as something 
superordinate to “the morality of the past”). This means that the capacity to reassess 
morality means identification with the figure that “generates and renews the world”— 
with the figure that mediates between order and chaos. It is “within the domain of that 
figure” that room for all aspects of the personality actually exist—as the demands placed 
on the individual who wishes to identify with the savior are so high, so to speak, that 
every aspect of personality must become manifested, “redeemed,” and integrated into a 
functioning hierarchy. The revaluation of good and evil therefore allows for the creative 
reintegration of those aspects of personality—and their secondary representations in 
imagination and idea—previously suppressed and stunted by immature moral ideation, 
including that represented by group affiliation (posited as the highest level of ethical 
attainment). 

The act of turning away from something anomalous is the process of labeling that 
anomalous thing as “too terrifying to be encountered or considered,” in its most 
fundamental form. To avoid something is also to define it—and, in a more general sense, 
to define oneself. To avoid is to say “that is too terrible,” and that means—“too terrible 
for me.” The impossibility of a task is necessarily determined in relationship to the 
abilities of the one faced with it. The act of turning away therefore means willful 
opposition to the process of adaptation, since nothing new can happen when everything 
new is avoided or suppressed. The act effacing an anomaly, by contrast, is the process of 
labeling that event as tolerable—and, simultaneously, the definition of oneself as the 
agent able to so tolerate. Adoption of such a stance means the possibility of further 
growth, since it is in contact with anomaly that new information is generated. This “faith 
in oneself and the benevolence of the world” manifests itself as the courage to risk 
everything in the pursuit of meaning. If the nature of the goal is shifted from desire for 
predictability to development of personality capable of facing chaos voluntarily, then the 
unknown, which can never be permanently banished, will no longer be associated with 
fear, and safety, paradoxically, will be permanently extablished: 

It was granted me to carry away from my prison years on my bent back, 
which nearly broke beneath its load, this essential experience: how a 
human being becomes evil and how good. In the intoxication of youthful 



The Hostile Brothers 375 


successes I had felt myself to be infallible, and I was therefore cruel. In 
the surfeit of power I was a murderer, and an oppressor. In my most evil 
moments, I was convinced that I was doing good, and I was well supplied 
with systematic arguments. And it was only when I lay there on rotting 
prison straw that I sensed within myself the first stirrings of good. 
Gradually it was disclosed to me that the line separating good and evil 
passes not through states, nor between classes, nor between political 
parties either—but right through every human heart—and through all 
human hearts. This line shifts. Inside us, it oscillates with the years. And 
even within hearts overwhelmed by evil, one small bridgehead of good is 
retained. And even in the best of all hearts, there remains...an uprooted 
small corner of evil. 

Since then I have come to understand the truth of all the religions of 
the world: They struggle with the evil inside a human being (inside every 
human being). It is impossible to expel evil from the world in its entirety, 
but it is possible to constrict it within each person. 

And since that time I have come to understand the falsehood of all the 
revolutions in history: They destroy only those carriers of evil 
contemporary with them (and also fail, out of haste, to discriminate the 
carriers of good as well). And they then take to themselves as their 
heritage the actual evil itself, magnified still more. 

The Nuremburg Trials have to be regarded as one of the special 
achievements of the twentieth century: they killed the very idea of evil, 
though they killed very few of the people who had been infected by it. (Of 
course, Stalin deserves no credit here. He would have preferred to explain 
less and shoot more.) And if by the twenty-first century humanity has not 
yet blown itself up and has not suffocated itself—perhaps it is this 
direction that will triumph? 

Yes, and if it does not triumph—then all humanity’s history will have 
turned out to be an empty exercise in marking time, without the tiniest 
mite of meaning! Whither and to what end will we otherwise be moving? 
To beat the enemy over the head with a club—even cavemen knew that. 

“Know thyself!” There is nothing that so aids and assists the 
awakening of omniscience within us as insistent thoughts about ones own 
trangressions, errors, mistakes. After the difficult cycles of such 
ponderings over many years, whenever I mentioned the heartlessness of 
our highest-ranking bureaucrats, the cruelty of our executioners, I 
remember myself in my captains shoulder boards and the forward march 
of my battery through East Prussia, enshrouded in fire, and I say: “So, 
were we any better?” 529 


HEROIC ADAPTATION: VOLUNTARY RECONSTRUCTION OF 
THE MAP OF MEANING 



Maps of meaning 376 


The group provides the protective structure—conditional meaning and 
behavioral pattern—that enables the individual to cast off the dependence 
of childhood, to make the transition from the maternal to the social, 
patriarchal world. The group is not the individual, however. Psychological 
development that ceases with group identification—held up as the highest 
attainable good by every ideologue—severely constricts individual and 
social potential, and dooms the group, inevitably, to sudden and 
catastrophic dissolution. Failure to transcend group identification is, in the 
final analysis, as pathological as failure to leave childhood. 

Movement from the group to the individual—like that from 
childhood to group—follows the archetypal transformative pattern 
of the heroic (paradise, breach, fall, redemption; stability, 
incorporation, dissolution, reconstruction). Such transformation 
must be undertaken voluntarily, through conscious exposure to the 
unknown—although it may be catalyzed by sufficiently unique or 
traumatic experience. Failure to initiate and/or successfully 
complete the process of secondary maturation heightens risk for 
intrapsychic and social decadence, and consequent experiential 
chaos, depression and anxiety (including suicidal ideation), or 
enhances tendency toward fanaticism, and consequent 
intrapsychic and group aggression. 

The Bible, considered as a single story, presents this “process of 
maturation” in mythological terms. The Old Testament offers group 
identity, codified by Moses, as antidote for the fallen state of man. 
This antidote, while useful, is incomplete—even Moses himself, a 
true ancestral hero, fails to reach the promised land. The New 
Testament, by contrast, offers identification with the hero as the 
means by which the “fallen state” and the problems of group 
identity might both be “permanently” transcended. The New 
Testament has been traditionally read as a description of a 
historical event, which redeemed mankind, once and for all: it might 
more reasonably be considered the description of a process that, if 
enacted, could bring about the establishment of peace on earth. 

The problem is, however, that this process cannot yet really be 
said to be consciously—that is, explicitly—understood. 
Furthermore, if actually undertaken, it is extremely frightening, 
particularly in the initial stages. In consequence, the “imitation of 
Christ”—or the central culture-hero of other religious systems— 
tends to take the form of ritualistic worship, separated from other 
“nonreligious” aspects of life. Voluntary participation in the heroic 
process, by contrast—which means courageous confrontation with 
the unknown—makes “worship” a matter of true identification. This 
means that the true “believer” rises above dogmatic adherence to 
realize the soul of the hero—to “incarnate that soul”—in every 
aspect of his day-to-day life. 



The Hostile Brothers 377 


This is easy to say, but very difficult to understand—and to do. It 
is no easy matter to translate the transpersonal myth of the hero 
into a template for action and representation, in the unique 
conditions that make up an individual life. It appears equally 
troublesome—even hubristic—to presume that the individual might 
be a force worthy of identification with the hero. Nonetheless, we 
are more than we seem—and are more trouble than we imagine, 
when undisciplined and unrealized. The “banality of evil”—Hannah 
Arendt’s famous phrase , 530 applied to the oft-unprepossessing Nazi 
“personality,” is more accurately “the evil of banality.” Our petty 
weaknesses accumulate, and multiply, and become the great evils 
of state. As our technological power expands, the danger we pose 
increases—and the consequences of our voluntary stupidity 
multiply. It is increasingly necessary that we set ourselves—not 
others—right, and that we learn explicitly what that means. 

The nature of the process of identification with the hero can be 
understood in great detail as a consequence of the analysis of 
alchemy, which Jung made his life’s work. Alchemy—considered 
most generally as the precursor of modern chemistry—was in fact 
a twenty-centuries’—long endeavor to understand the 
“transformations of matter.” The alchemical matter, however, was 
not the matter of modern science—logically enough, as the ancient 
alchemists practiced in the absence of the presumptions and tools 
of modern science. It was a substance more like Tao—“that which 
produced or constituted the flux of being”; something more like 
“information” in the modern sense (if information may be 
considered latent in unexplored places); something more like the 
unknown as such (something like the matrix of being). Investigation 
of this instrinsically compelling “matter”—this unknown—produced 
a series of internal transformations in the alchemical psyche, 
making it ever-more akin to the Philosopher’s stone: something that 
could turn “base matter” into spiritual gold; something that had, in 
addition, the eternal, durable and indestructible nature of stone. As 
the alchemical endeavor progressed, through the Christian era, the 
“stone” became increasingly assimilated to Christ—the cornerstone 
“rejected by the builders,” the agent of voluntary transformation— 
whose actions eternally transform the “fallen world” into paradise. 

The late-stage alchemists “posited” that a personality that had 
completely assimilated the “spirit of the unknown” was equivalent to 
Christ. Jung translated their image-laden mythological language 
into something more comprehensible—but not yet understood. The 
terrible central message of this mode of thought is this: do not lie, 
particularly to yourself, or you will undermine the process that gives 
you the strength to bear the tragic world. In your weakness—the 
consequence of your lie—you will become cruel, arrogant and 



Maps of meaning 378 


vengeful. You will then serve as an “unconscious” emissary of the 
agent of destruction, and work to bring about the end of life. 


The Creative Illness and the Hero 

“I.N.R.I.”—“Igni Natura Renovatur Integra” 531 


The “third mode” of adaptation—alternative to decadence and fascism—is heroic. 
Heroism is comparatively rare, because it requires voluntary sacrifice of group-fostered 
certainty, and indefinite acceptance of consequent psychological chaos, attendant upon 
(re)exposure to the unknown. This is nonetheless the creative path, leading to new 
discovery or reconfiguration, comprising the living element of culture. The creative actor 
adopts the role of hero, and places himself beyond (even in opposition to) the protective 
enclave of history. In consequence, he suffers re-exposure to the terrible unknown. Such 
re-exposure engenders mortal terror, but allows for union with possibility—allows for 
inspiration, reconstruction and advancement. It is the disintegration and disinhibition of 
meaning (preceding its reintegration)—occurrences necessarily attendant upon the heroic 
process—that produce the phenomena linking genius, in the popular imagination, with 
insanity. The genius and the lunatic are separated, however, by their relative position with 
regard to the unknown: the genius is the fortunate hero who faces the unexpected 
consequences of his insufficiently adaptive behavior voluntarily, on ground that he has 
chosen. The unfortunate madman, by constrast, has run away from something 
carnivorous, something that thrives on neglect and grows larger—something that will 
finally devour him. The genius dissolves, is flooded with indeterminate meaning, and is 
then reconstituted—then dissolves, floods and reconfigures the social world. The 
psychotic dissolves, and drowns in the flood. 

It is capacity to voluntarily face the unknown, and to reconfigure accordingly the 
propositions that guided past adaptation, that constitutes the eternal spirit of man, the 
world-creating Word. The existence and nature of that spirit has been granted due 
recognition in Western (and Eastern) philosophy and religion since time immemorial. 
The eminent theologist Reinhold Niebuhr states: 

In both Plato and Aristotle “mind” is sharply distinguished from the body. 

It is the unifying and ordering principle, the organ of logos, which brings 
harmony into the life of the soul, as logos is the creative and forming 
principle of the world. Greek metaphysical presuppositions are naturally 
determinative for the doctrine of man; and since Parmenides Greek 
philosophy had assumed an identity between being and reason on the one 
hand and on the other presupposed that reason works upon some formless 
or unformed stuff which is never completely tractable. In the thought of 
Aristotle matter is “a remnant, the non-existent in itself unknowable and 
alien to reason, that remains after the process of clarifying the thing into 
form and conception. This non-existent neither is nor is not; it is not yet, 
that is to say it attains reality only insofar as it becomes the vehicle of 
some conceptual determination. ” 



The Hostile Brothers 379 


The notion of the spirit’s intrinsic kinship with the creator was abstractly elaborated, in 
much more detail, in the eventual course of development of Judeo-Christian thought. 
From this viewpoint, man is understood most profoundly in terms of his relationship to 
God—as made in the “image of God”—rather than in light of his cognitive abilities or his 
place in nature. The essence of this “spirit identified with God” is the eternal capacity to 
create and to transform. Niebuhr observes that 

The human spirit has the special capacity of standing continually outside 
itself in terms of indefinite regression.... The self knows the world, 
insofar as it knows the world, because it stands outside both itself and the 
world, which means that it cannot understand itself except as it is 
understood from beyond itself and the world. 534 

This capacity for infinite transcendence, which is the ability to abstract, and then 
represent the abstraction, and then abstract from the representation, and so on, without 
end, does not come without a cost, as we have previously observed. We can tumble down 
the deck of cards, as easily as erect it; furthermore, our capacity for evil is integrally 
linked with our ability to overcome boundaries. 

Abstract thinking in general, and abstract moral thinking in particular, is play: the 
game, “what if?” Games are played by first establishing, then identifying, then altering, 
basic presuppositions. Before any game can be played, the rules have to be established; 
before the game can be altered, the rules have to be made manifest. A game (at least in its 
final stages) is played by constructing an image of “the world” in imagination, in 
accordance with certain presuppositions—which are the rules (the “environment”) of the 
game—and then by acting in that imaginary world. This game construction, playing and 
modifying is a form of practice, for real-world activity. As games increase in complexity, 
in fact, it becomes increasingly difficult to distinguish them from real-world activity. 

The game itself, at its first stages, is played at the procedural level; the rules remain 
implicit. Once a representation of the game has been established, then the game can be 
shared; later, the rules themselves can be altered. Piaget discusses the formulation of the 
rules of children’s games: 

From the point of view of the practice or application of rules four 
successive stages can be distinguished. 

A first stage of a purely motor and individual character, during which 
the child handles the marbles at the dictation of his desires and motor 
habits. This leads to the formation of more or less ritualized schemas, but 
since play is still purely individual, one can only talk of motor rules and 
not of truly collective rules. 

The second may be called egocentric for the following reasons. This 
stage begins at the moment when the child receives from outside the 
example of codified rules, that is to say, some time between the ages of 2 
and 5. But though the child imitates this example, he continues to play 
either by himself without bothering to find play-fellows, or with others, 
but without trying to win, and therefore without attempting to unify the 
different ways of playing. In other words, children of this stage, even 




Maps of meaning 380 


when they are playing together, play each one “on his own” (everyone can 
win at once) and without regard for any codification of rules. This dual 
character, combining imitation of others with a purely individual use of 
the examples received, we have designated by the term Egocentrism. 

A third stage appears between 7 and 8, which we shall call the stage of 
incipient cooperation. Each player now tries to win, and all, therefore, 
begin to concern themselves with the question of mutual control and of 
unification of the rules. But while a certain agreement may be reached in 
the course of one game, ideas about the rules in general are still rather 
vague. In other words, children of 7-8, who belong to the same class at 
school and are therefore constantly playing with each other, give, when 
they are questioned separately, disparate and often entirely contradictory 
accounts of the rules observed in playing marbles. 

Finally, between the years of 11 and 12, appears a fourth stage, which 
is that of the codification of rides. Not only is every detail of procedure in 
the game fixed, but the actual code of rules to be observed is known to the 
whole society. There is remarkable concordance in the information given 
by children of 10-12 belonging to the same class at school, when they are 
questioned on the rules of the game and their possible variations.... 

If, now, we turn to the consciousness of rules we shall find a 
progression that is even more elusive in detail, but no less clearly marked 
if taken on a big scale. We may express this by saying that the progression 
runs through three stages, of which the second begins during the 
egocentric stage and ends towards the middle of the stage of cooperation 
(9-10), and of which the third covers the remainder of this co-operating 
stage and the whole of the stage marked by the codification of rules. 

During the first stage rules are not yet coercive in character, either 
because they are purely motor, or else (at the beginning of the egocentric 
stage) because they are received, as it were, unconsciously, and as 
interesting examples rather than as obligatory realities. 

During the second stage (apogee of egocentric and first half of 
cooperating stage) rules are regarded as sacred and untouchable, 
emanating from adults and lasting forever. Every suggested alteration 
strikes the child as a transgression. 

Finally, during the third stage, a rule is looked upon as a law due to 
mutual consent, which you must respect if you want to be loyal but which 
it is permissible to alter on the condition of enlisting general opinion on 
your side. 

The correlation between the three stages in the development of the 
consciousness of rules and the four stages relating to their practical 
observance is of course only a statistical correlation and therefore very 
crude. But broadly speaking the relation seems to us indisputable. The 
collective rule is at first something external to the individual and 
consequently sacred to him; then, as he gradually makes it his own, it 
comes to that extent to be felt as the free product of mutual agreement and 
an autonomous conscience. And with regard to practical use, it is only 



The Hostile Brothers 381 


natural that a mystical respect for laws should be accompanied by a 
rudimentary knowledge and application of their contents, while a rational 
and well-founded respect is accompanied by an effective application of 
each rule in detail. ’ 

The “second-stage” child, who accepts the presuppositions of his cultural subtradition as 
“sacred and untouchable,” thinks in a manner similar to the classic, partially hypothetical, 
pre-experimental or “primitive” man, who worships the past, in representation, as 
absolute truth. The child and the primitive are both concerned primarily with how to 
behave —how to organize behavior, contra nature, in the social community, to 
simultaneously and continuously meet ends deemed desirable. It is only much later, after 
these most fundamental of issues have been resolved, that the means of resolution 
themselves can be questioned. This act of higher-order conceptualization means 
emergence of ability to play games, with the rules of games—and belief in the 
justifiability of such activity (this rebuff to traditional order). This more abstract ability 
allows for answer to the meta-problem of morality, posed (much) earlier: not “how to 
behave?” but “how can (or is or was) how to behave be determined?” 5 ' 6 Paradoxically, 
perhaps, the answer to this meta-problem also provides the final answer to the 
(apparently) less abstract question “how to behave?” or “what is the good?” 

Some examples from Western religious tradition may aid in comprehending (1) the 
nature of the distinction between morality’s central problem (“what is the good?”) and 
meta-problem (“how are answers to the question ‘what is the good?’ determined?”); (2) 
the structure of their attendant resolutions; and (3) the manner in which the meta-problem 
and its solution follow in the course of historical development from the problem and its 
solution—attended by (cyclical) development of increasingly sophisticated and powerful 
(selljconsciousness. Let us begin with the problem of (selljconsciousness, which appears 
in part as enhanced ability of the declarative memory system to accurately encode the 
nature of human behavior, self and other. This encoding first takes the form of the 
narrative, or myth, which, as stated previously, is semantic use of episodic representation 
of procedural wisdom. 

Semantic analysis of narrative—criticism 537 —allows for derivation of abstracted 
moral principles. First-order pure semantic codification of the morality implicit in 
behavior, and then in episodic/semantic (narrative or mythic) representation, appears to 
take the form of the list. A list of laws—moral rules—straightforwardly and simply 
defines what constitutes acceptable behavior and what does not. An explicit list serves as 
an admirable guide for the adolescent, emerging from the maternal world. Such a list 
might be regarded as the most basic form of explicit moral philosophy. 

The list emerges into the narrative of Judeo-Christian consciousness as a consequence 
of the actions of the figure of Moses, who serves as lawgiver for the Jewish people. 
Moses has many of the attributes of the (typical) mythical hero, and constitutes a figure 
analogous to that of the supernatural ancestor of the primitive. He is characterized by 
endangered birth, for example, and by dual parentage (one set humble, one exalted or 
divine): 


And the king of Egypt spake to the Hebrew midwives, of which the name 
of the one was Shiprah, and the name of the other Puah: 



Maps of meaning 382 


And he said. When ye do the office of a midwife to the Hebrew 
women, and see them upon the stools; if it be a son, then ye shall kill 
him 538 : blit if it be a daughter, then she shall live. 

But the midwives feared God, and did not as the king of Egypt 
comanded them, but saved the men children alive. 

And the king of Egypt called for the midwives, and said unto them, 

Why have ye done this thing, and saved the men children alive? 

And the midwives said unto Pharaoh, Because the Hebrew women are 
not as the Egyptian women: for they are lively, and are delivered ere the 
midwives come in unto them. 

Therefore God dealt well with the midwives: and the people mutiplied, 
and waxed very mighty. 

And it came to pass, because the midwives feared God, that he made 
them houses. 

And Pharaoh charged all his people, saying, Every son that is born ye 
shall cast into the river, and every daughter ye shall save alive. 

And there went a man of the house of Levi, and took to wife a daughter 
of Levi. 

And the woman conceived, and bare a son: and when she saw him that 
he was a goodly child, she hid him three months. 

And when she could not longer hide him, she took for him an ark of 
bulrushes, and daubed it with slime and with pitch, and put the child 
therein; and she laid it in the flags by the river’s brink. 

And his sister stood afar off, to wit what would be done to him. 

And the daughter of Pharaoh came down to wash herself at the river; 
and her maidens walked along by the river’s side; and when she saw the 
ark among the flags, she sent her maid to fetch it. 

And when she had opened it, she saw the child: and, behold, the babe 
wept. And she had compassion on him, and said, This is one of the 
Hebrews’ children. 

Then said his sister to Pharaoh’s daughter, Shall I go and call to thee a 
nurse of the Hebrew women, that she may nurse the child for thee? 

And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, Go. And the maid went and called 
the child’s mother. And Pharaoh’s daughter said unto her, Take this child 
away, and nurse it for me, and I will give thee wages. And the woman 
took the child, and nursed it. 

And the child grew, and she brought him unto Pharaohs daughter, and 
he became her son. And she called his name Moses: and she said, Because 
I drew him out of the water. (Exodus 1:15-22; 2:1-10) 

After Moses reaches adulthood, he rejects his secondary Egyptian heritage and rejoins the 
Hebrews—in time becoming their leader and leading them away from Egypt and 
Egyptian servitude (from slavery under tyranny). He takes them on a heroic journey, 
from the unbearable and fallen present condition, through the (purgatorial) desert—where 
they act in accordance with procedures he establishes—to (earthly) paradise itself, the 
Promised Land of milk and honey. Frye comments: 



The Hostile Brothers 383 


The Biblical pattern for the purgatorial vision is the Exodus narrative, 
which is in three major parts. First is the sojourn in Egypt, the “furnace of 
iron,” a world visited by plagues, where the Egyptian desire to 
exterminate the Hebrews goes into reverse with the slaughter of the 
Egyptian firstborn sons. This episode concludes with the crossing of the 
Red Sea, the separation of Israel from Egypt, and the drowning of the 
Egyptian host. The second episode is the wandering in the wilderness, a 
labyrinthine period of lost direction, where one generation has to die off 
before a new one can enter the Promised Land (Psalm 95:11). This is one 
of several features indicating that we are in a world transcending history, 
and that it is in the more poetic language of the prophets that the true or 
symbolic meaning of Egypt, wilderness and Promised Land emerges more 
clearly. 

The third stage is the entry into the Promised Land, where Moses, 
personifying the older generation, dies just outside it. In Christian 
typology.. .this means that the law, which Moses symbolizes, cannot 
redeem mankind: only his successor Joshua, who bears the same name as 
Jesus, can invade and conquer Canaan. 539 ' 540 

Moses is a revolutionary; he teaches his people a new mode of being. This means he 
revalues their goals as well as their means. This process of revolutionary readaptation is 
necessarily preceded by a period of intense suffering, as the affects released by the new 
situation fight among themselves, so to speak, until subdued. The biblical story portrays 
this process dramatically, presenting it in terms of the lengthy and trying desert sojourn. 
The provision of “heavenly” food 541 during this time is a hint to the meaning, so to speak, 
of the story—the interregnum of pain and confusion that precedes the re-establishment or 
improvement of stability can be tolerated only by those fed on “spiritual bread”; can be 
tolerated only by those who have incorporated sufficient meaning and have therefore 
developed wisdom, patience and faith. 

In the course of the exodus, Moses begins to serve as judge for his people. He is 
spontaneously chosen by them, perhaps on the basis of perceived strength or integration 
of character, as mediator between conflicting claims of value. In this role, he is forced to 
determine what was right, or what should be—and what was wrong, or comparatively 
wrong: 


And it came to pass on the morrow, that Moses sat to judge the people: 
and the people stood by Moses from the morning unto the evening. 

And when Moses’ father in law saw all that he did to the people, he 
said, What is this thing that thou doest to the people? why sittest thou 
thyself alone, and all the people stand by thee from morning unto even? 

And Moses said unto his father in law, Because the people come unto 
me to inquire of God: 

When they have a matter, they come unto me; and I judge between one 
and another, and I do make them know the statutes of God, and his laws. 
(Exodus 18:13-16) 



Maps of meaning 384 


Adoption of this responsibility entails voluntary acceptance of tremendous intrapsychic 
strain—strain associated with necessity of constant, demanding moral judgment 
(establishment of hierarchical order, resultant of intrapsychic quasi-Darwinian struggle of 
abstracted values)—and, when the ability is there, consequent generation of 
compensatory adaptive activity. In the mythic case of Moses, such activity took the form 
of translation —translation of moral principles from procedure, and narrative 
representation thereof, into an abstract semantic code. This act of translation constituted a 
tremendous leap forward, a qualitative shift in human cognition—regardless of whether it 
was actually undertaken by Moses, or by any number of individuals, over hundreds of 
years (a flash in time, nonetheless, from the evolutionary perspective), and conflated into 
a “single event” by the socially mediated process of mythological memory. The 
emergence of moral knowledge in explicit semantic form (as opposed to its implicit 
representation in narrative) appears represented in mythology as “brought about” by 
revelation. This revelation is reception of knowledge “from a higher source”—in this 
case, from the episodic to the semantic memory systems (from the mysterious domain of 
imagination to the concrete word). 

Generation ( disinhibition, more accurately) of overwhelming affect will necessarily 
characterize transitions in cognitive ability of this magnitude; generation akin to that 
accompanying the “insight” phenomena typical of creative or psychotherapeutic 
endeavor. This might be considered a consequence of initial temporary establishment of 
intrapsychic integration—establishment of isormorphism or concordance between the 
procedural, episodic and semantic memory systems—and recognition of the manifold 
possibilities (the hitherto unforeseeen redemptive opportunities) thereby released. The 
“first discovery” of a new categorization system means immediate apprehension of the 
broad “potential utility” of those things newly comprehended (means understanding of 
their refreshed promise). This “first discovery”— Eureka !—is the positive aspect of the 
voluntary renovelization of experience. This process is dramatically represented in 
Exodus by the transformation of Moses’ appearance as a consequence of his protracted 
encounter with God: 

And he was there with the Lord forty days and forty nights; he did neither 
eat bread, nor drink water. 

And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the ten 
commandments. And it came to pass, when Moses came down from 
mount Sinai with the two tables of testimony in Moses’ hand, when he 
came down from the mount, that Moses wist not that the skin of his face 
shone while he talked with him. 

And when Aaron and all the children of Israel saw Moses, behold, the 
skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to come nigh him. 

And Moses called unto them; and Aaron and all the rulers of the 
congregation returned unto him: and Moses talked with them. 

And afterward all the children of Israel came nigh: and he gave them in 
commandment all that the Lord had spoken with him in Mount Sinai. 
(Exodus 34:28-32) 



The Hostile Brothers 385 


This “shining face” is mythic (semantic/episodic) equation of the individual with solar 
power; symbolic of illumination, enlightenment, momentary transfiguration into eternal 
representative of the gods. This “great leap forward” places Moses temporarily into the 
company of God. 

Moses transforms what had previously been custom, embedded in behavior, 
represented in myth, into an explicit semantic code. The Decalogue is the single most 
fundamental subset of the “new” code: 

Thou shalt have no other gods before me. 

Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image, or any likeness of 
anything that is in heaven above, or that is in the earth beneath, or that is 
in the water under the earth: 

Thou shalt not bow down thyself to them nor serve them: for I the Lord 
thy God am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the 
children unto the third and fourth generation of them that hate me. 

And shewing mercy unto thousands of them that love me, and keep my 
commandments. 

Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain; for the Lord 
will not hold him guiltless that taketh his name in vain. 

Remember the sabbath day, to keep it holy. 

Six days shalt thou labor, and do all thy work: 

But the seventh day is the sabbath of the Lord thy God: In it thou shalt 
not do any work, thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy manservant, nor 
thy maidservant, nor thy castle, nor thy stranger that is within thy gates: 

For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that in 
them is, and rested the seventh day: wherefore the Lord blessed the 
sabbath day, and hallowed it. 542 

Honour thy father and thy mother. 

Thou shalt not kill. 

Thou shalt not commit adultery. 

Thou shalt not steal. 

Thou shalt not bear false witness against thy neighbour. 

Thou shalt not covet thy neighbour’s house, thou shalt not covet thy 
neighbour’s wife, nor his manservant, nor his maidservant, nor his ox, nor 
his ass, nor any thing that is thy neighbour’s. (Exodus 20:3-17) 

Codification of tradition is necessarily dependent upon existence of tradition— 
established adaptive behavior, and secondary representation thereof. The knowledge 
embodied in such tradition exists as a consequence of evolutionary pressure, so to speak, 
operating primarily (in the literal sense) at the level of interpersonal action, and is only 
secondarily, lately, translated up the hierarchy of consciousness to representation. This 
means that evolution proceeds at least as often (and, generally, more profoundly) from 
behavior to representation (episodic and semantic)—from adaptive action and mythic 
portrayal thereof (all true art included) to abstract verbal knowledge—as from 
representation to behavior. 



Maps of meaning 386 


Translation of tradition into law makes verbally abstract what had previously been, at 
best, encoded in image—makes the morality of the culture and the moral individual 
“conscious” for the first time. This act of transformation, culminating in a qualitative 
shift of cognitive sophistication in the intrapsychic activity of a mythologized culture 
hero, constitutes the consequence of centuries of abstract adaptive endeavor. The actions 
of the hero are identified with heavenly attributes “by the story,” to signify the import 
(and intrapsychic locale and source 546 ) of the revolutionary occurrence. Nietzsche states: 

Great men, like great epochs, are explosive material in whom tremendous 
energy has been accumulated; their prerequisite has always been, 
historically and physiologically, that a protracted assembling, 
accumulating, economizing and preserving has preceded them—that there 
has been no explosion for a long time. If the tension in the mass has 
grown too great the merest accidental stimulus suffices to call the 
“genius,” the “deed,” the great destiny, into the world. 547 

The moral presumptions of a society emerge first in procedural form, as a consequence of 
individual exploratory activity, which is the process that generates novel behavioral 
patterns. These behavioral patterns are then hierarchically structured as a consequence of 
quasi-Darwinian competition, in accordance with the constraints noted previously (appeal 
to imagination, self-sustenance, etc.). The episodic memory systems map procedure, and 
outcome thereof, and thereby come to contain similar paradigmatic structure— 
imagistically, and then more purely semantically. Over time, the unknown, nature, 
thereby comes to be represented mythically as the affectively bivalent Great Mother, 
simultaneously creative and destructive. The known, culture, becomes the Great Father, 
tyrant and wise king, authoritarian and protective personality, adapted to the unknown. 
The knower, man, becomes the hostile mythic brothers, sons of convention, hero and 
antihero, Christ and Satan—eternal generator and destroyer of history and tradition. 
Semantic cognition, feeding on narrative—the bridge between the episode and the pure 
verbal abstraction—derives “rules” from behavior. Application of the rules alters the 
environment, including procedural and episodic representations thereof. Thus the cycle 
continues. 

Culture protects the individual against the consequences of his or her vulnerability (at 
least in its positive aspect); but the price paid for absolute security is freedom and 
individuality, and therefore, creativity. Sacrifice of individual creativity, by choice, 
eventually deprives life of pleasure, of meaning—but not of anxiety or pain—and 
therefore renders life unbearable. Civilized or historical Homo sapiens grows up within a 
structured canon of principles implicitly and explicitly posited and held as absolute by the 
majority of individuals within his or her civilization. In return for this legacy, which is in 
fact the sum total of the efforts of mankind over thousands of years, the individual is 
molded and shaped, and can therefore survive independently; but all this shaping is not 
purely beneficial. It is an unhappy fact that the intrinsically rewarding, implicitly 
interesting activities associated with individual heroism often come to pose a threat to the 
established structure of the group. 

The Great Father, positive aspect of history, protects man from the Terrible Mother. 
He is civilized order, education and wisdom embodied and represented, the abstracted 



The Hostile Brothers 387 


and integrated personification of all those heroes who have come before and left their 
mark on the (cultural) behavior of the species. He is ritual model for emulation—Good 
King, Wise Judge, Man of Courage, of Action, of Art, of Thought. Insofar as he 
represents particular, specific patterns of action, however, he is the enemy of possibility, 
of life in the present itself, of the hero—and is therefore, necessarily, captor of the spirit, 
embodiment of the Tyrant, the Bureaucrat. This is history as the Terrible Father, dead 
weight of the past, crushing mass of narrow, bigoted, ill-informed opinion and popular 
prejudice. This is the force that oppresses the Good Mother, the creative aspect of life 
itself. The Terrible Father opposes anything new, anything that threatens his integral 
structure and absolute dominance. Identification of the well-adapted man with his culture 
means that as history becomes established, in counterposition to the force that nature 
represents, the creative hero has to battle public opinion [composed, when ideological, of 
contemporary slogans ( sluagh-ghairms: battle cries of the dead)] as well as the forces of 
the “natural” unknown. The hero is an enemy of the historically determined structure of 
values and assumptions, because he may have to reorder that structure and not merely 
add to or maintain it, to deal with what still remains unknown. In that process of 
reordering, unfortunately, he risks exposing himself and all those well-adapted men who 
identify with and maintain that culture to the terrible forces of the unknown—to mortal 
anxiety and dread, to fear of the void, to terror of insanity, physical destruction, and 
annihilation. 

These ideas are dramatically presented in Dostoevsky’s The Grand Inquisitor. Ivan, 
tormented atheist, tells a story he has invented to his religiously minded younger brother, 
Alyosha, a novice at the local monastery. Christ returns to earth, to Seville, during the 
time of the Spanish Inquisition: 

He came unobserved and moved about silently but, strangely enough, 
those who saw Him recognized Him at once. This might, perhaps, be the 
best part of my poem if I could explain what made them recognize Him.... 

People are drawn to Him by an irresistible force, they gather around Him, 
follow Him, and soon there is a crowd. He walks among them in silence, a 
gentle smile of infinite compassion on His lips. The sun of love burns in 
His heart; light, understanding, and spiritual power flow from His eyes 
and set people’s hearts vibrating with love for Him. He holds His hands 
out to them, blesses them, and just from touching Him, or even His 
clothes, comes a healing power. An old man who has been blind from 
childhood suddenly cries out to Him: “Cure me, oh Lord, so that I may 
see You too!” And it is as if scales had fallen from his eyes, and the blind 
man sees Him. People weep and kiss the ground on which He walks. 
Children scatter flowers in His path and cry out to Him, “Hosannah!” “It 
is He, He Himself!” people keep saying. “Who else could it be!” He stops 
on the steps of the cathedral of Seville at a moment when a small white 
coffin is carried into the church by weeping bearers. In it lies a girl of 
seven, the only daughter of a prominent man. She lies there amidst 
flowers. “He will raise your child from the dead!” people shout to the 
weeping mother. The priest, who has come out of the cathedral to meet 
the procession, looks perplexed and frowns. But now the mother of the 



Maps of meaning 388 


dead child throws herself at His feet, wailing, “If it is truly You, give me 
back my child!” and she stretches out her hands to Him. The procession 
stops. They put the coffin down at His feet. He looks down with 
compassion, His lips form the words “Talitha cumi” —arise, maiden— 
and the maiden arises. The little girl sits up in her coffin, opens her little 
eyes, looks around in surprise, and smiles. She holds the white roses that 
had been placed in her hand when they had laid her in the coffin. There is 
confusion among the people, shouting and weeping. 

Just at that moment, the Cardinal, the Grand Inquisitor himself, crosses 
the cathedral square. He is a man of almost ninety, tall and erect. His face 
is drawn, his eyes are sunken, but they still glow as though a spark 
smoldered in them. Oh, now he is not wearing his magnificent cardinal’s 
robes in which he paraded before the crowds the day before, when they 
were burning the enemies of the Roman Church; no, today he is wearing 
just the coarse cassock of an ordinary monk. He is followed by his grisly 
assistants, his slaves, his “holy guard.” He sees the crowd gathered, stops, 
and watches from a distance. He sees everything: the placing of the coffin 
at His feet and the girl rising from it. His face darkens. He knits his thick 
white brows; his eyes flash with an ominous fire. He points his finger and 
orders his guards to seize Him. 

The Grand Inquisitor’s power is so great and the people are so 
submissive and tremblingly obedient to him that they immediately open 
up a passage for the guards. A death-like silence descends upon the square 
and in that silence the guards lay hands on Him and lead Him away. 

Then everyone in the crowd, to a man, prostrates himself before the 
Grand Inquisitor. The old man blesses them in silence and passes on. 

The guards take their prisoner to an old building of the Holy 
Inquisition and lock Him up there in a dark, narrow, vaulted prison cell. 
The day declines and is replaced by the stifling, black Southern night of 
Seville. The air is fragrant with laurel and lemon. 

Suddenly, in the complete darkness, the iron gate of the cell opens and 
there stands the Grand Inquisitor himself, holding a light in his hand. The 
old man enters the cell alone and, when he is inside, the door closes 
behind him. He stops and for a long time—one or even two minutes—he 
looks at Him. At last he sets the light down on the table and says: “You? 
Is it really You?” Receiving no answer, he continues in great haste: 

“You need not answer me. Say nothing. I know only too well what 
You could tell me now. Besides, You have no right to add anything to 
what You said before. Why did You come here, to interfere and make 
things difficult for us? For You came to interfere—You know it. But shall 
I tell You what will happen tomorrow? Well, I do not know who You 
really are, nor do I want to know whether You are really He or just a 
likeness of Him, but no later than tomorrow I shall pronounce You the 
wickedest of all heretics and sentence You to be burned at the stake, and 
the very people who today were kissing Your feet will tomorrow, at a sign 
of my hand, hasten to Your stake to rake the coals. Don’t You know it? 



The Hostile Brothers 389 


Oh yes, I suppose You do,” he added, deeply immersed in thought, his 
eyes fixed for a moment on his prisoner. 548 

Despite his tyrannical actions, the Inquisitor feels compelled to justify his actions before 
Christ: 


“Your great prophet had a vision and told us in an allegory that he had 
seen all those who were in the first resurrection and that there were twelve 
thousand of them from each tribe. But if there were so many, they must 
have been gods rather than men. They bore Your cross, they endured 
years and years of hunger in a barren wilderness, living on roots and 
locusts—and of course, You can point proudly at these children of 
freedom, at their freely given love, and at their magnificent suffering for 
Your sake. Remember, though, there were only a few thousand of them, 
and even these were gods rather than men. But what about the rest? Why 
should the rest of mankind, the weak ones, suffer because they are unable 
to stand what the strong ones can? Why is it the fault of a weak soul if it 
he cannot live up to such terri-fying gifts? Can it really be true that You 
came only for the chosen few? If that is so, it is a mystery that we cannot 
understand; and if it is a mystery, we have the right to preach to man that 
what matters is not freedom of choice or love, but a mystery that he must 
worship blindly, even at the expense of his con-science. And that is 
exactly what we have done. We have corrected your Work and have now 
founded it on miracle, mystery and authority. And men rejoice at being 
led like cattle again, with the terrible gift of freedom that brought them so 
much suffering removed from them. Tell me, were we right in preaching 
and acting as we did? Was it not our love for men that made us resign 
ourselves to the idea of their impotence and lovingly try to lighten the 
burden of their responsibility, even allowing their weak nature to sin, but 
with our permission? Why have You come to interfere with our work?” 549 

The old priest explains what historical role the institution of the church has played, and 

why—and provides rationale for the necessity of the impending recrucifixion: 

“And we, who have taken their sins upon us to give them happiness, will 
stand up and say to You: ‘Judge us if You can and if You dare!’ Know 
that I am not afraid of You; know that I, too, lived in the wilderness, fed 
upon roots and locusts, that I, too, blessed the freedom which You 
bestowed upon men, and that I, too, was prepared to take my place among 
the strong chosen ones, aspiring to be counted among them. But I came to 
my senses and refused to serve a mad cause. I turned away and joined 
those who were endeavoring to correct Your work. I left the proud and 
tmned to the meek, for the hap-piness of the meek. What I have told You 
will happen and our kingdom will come. I repeat, tomorrow You will see 
obedient herds, at the first sign from me, hurry to heap coals on the fire 
beneath the stake at which I shall have You burned, because, by coming 



Maps of meaning 390 


here, You have made our task more difficult. For if anyone has ever 
deserved our fire, it is You, and I shall have You burned tomorrow. 

Dixil ” 550 


The story takes an unexpected twist just prior to its conclusion—a twist that illustrates 
Dostoyevsky’s genius, and his capacity to leap beyond the ideologically and easily 
obvious. Ivan says: 

The Grand Inquisitor falls silent and waits for some time for the prisoner 
to answer. The prisoner’s silence has weighed on him. He has watched 
Him; He listened to him intently, looking gently into his eyes, and 
apparently unwilling to speak. The old man longs for Him to say 
something, however painful and terrifying. But instead, He suddenly goes 
over to the old man and kisses him gently on his old, bloodless lips. And 
that is his only answer. The old man is startled and shudders. The corners 
of his lips seem to quiver slightly. He walks to the door, opens it, and says 
to Him, “Go now, and do not come back...ever. You must never, never, 
come again!” And he lets the prisoner out into the dark streets of the city. 

The prisoner leaves. 551 

As William James said: “The community stagnates without the impulse of the individual. 
The impulse dies away without the sympathy of the community.” 552 

The myths of a culture are its central stories. These stories provide a dramatic record 
of the historically predicated transformation of human intent, and appear to exist as the 
episodic/semantic embodiment of history’s cumulative effect on action. The mythical 
narratives that accompany retention of historically determined behavior constitute 
nonempirical episodic representation of that behavior and its method of establishment. 
Myth is purpose, coded in episodic memory. Mythic truth is information, derived from 
past experience—derived from past observation of behavior—relevant from the 
perspective of fundamental motivation and affect. Myth simultaneously provides a record 
of historical essential, in terms of behavior, and programs those historical essentials. 
Narrative provides semantic description of action in image, back-translatable into 
imaginary episodic events, capable of eliciting imitative behavior. Mythic narrative offers 
dramatic presentation of morality, which is the study of what should be. Such narrative 
concerns itself with the meaning of the past, with the implications of past existence for 
current and future activity. This meaning constitutes the ground for the organization of 
behavior. 

Mythic drama, which plays out the exploits of exceptional individuals, appears 
devoted toward explication of a generally applicable pattern of adaptation. This 
archetypal model serves to aid in the generation of all situation-specific individual 
behaviors. Myth evolves toward declarable description of a procedural schema capable of 
underlying construction of all complex culturally determined hierarchies of specific 
behavior. This schematic pattern matches the innate, instinctual, neuropsychologically 
predicated individual potential for creative exploratory behavior—indeed, has been 
constructed in the course of historical observation of that potential in action. The 
expression of this potential throughout history provides for the creation of specific 



The Hostile Brothers 391 


environmentally appropriate social contexts, procedural and episodic, which promote 
development of the innate capacities of the individual, protect from danger, offer hope, 
and inhibit existential fear. 

A ring of ancestral spirits, invisible and unknown, surrounds the modern individual, 
and protects him or her magically from darkness and chaos. When this ring is broken— 
when the principles these spirits represent become subject to critical evaluation, to the 
onslaught of other forms of heroism, to other ideologies, or to the weight of individual 
experience—knowledge itself loses context, and the known reverts to the unknown. This 
does not mean that the Terrible Mother herself sleeps under human consciousness; it 
means rather that the reasons for her “existence” thousands of years ago are still 
sufficient reasons today. It is not a ques-tion of racial memory, transmitted by 
Lamarckian means, but of the proclivity to experience similarly under similar conditions. 
These conditions arise eternally when the protective veil of culture is pierced. 

History protects man against overwhelming material and spiritual onslaught. It 
performs this function by providing a framework of meaning for those enmeshed within 
it. History, conceived of in this manner, comprises those a priori assumptions all cultures 
base themselves on, which guide the action of individuals, enraptured by “the spirit of the 
times.” This framework of meaning is by necessity predicated upon various articles of 
faith and can be described in its totality as a myth (although it also precedes myth). The 
“highest levels” of myth provide man with the capacity to attribute meaning to or to 
discover meaning within the tragedy of each individual human life, forever blessed and 
cursed by society, forever threatened and redeemed by the unknown. To live, at this 
mythic level—rather than to hide—means the possibility of reaching and perhaps 
exceeding the highest stage of consciousness yet attained or conceptualized by a 
particular culture. This mythic life is symbolically represented by the savior —the 
individual who embodies the essential aspects of the mythological drama. In the Western 
tradition, for better or worse, like it or not, that individual is Christ. Frye states: 

The significance of the life of Jesus is often thought of as a legal 
significance, consisting in a life of perfect morality, or total conformity to 
a code of right action. But if we think of his significance as prophetic 
rather than legal, his real significance is that of being the one figure in 
history whom no organized human society could possibly put up with. 

The society that rejected him represented all societies: those responsible 
for his death were not the Romans or the Jews or whoever happened to be 
around at the time, but the whole of mankind down to ourselves and 
doubtless far beyond. “It is expedient that one man die for the people,” 
said Caiphas (John 18:14), and there has never been a human society that 
has not agreed with him. 

What primarily distinguishes Christianity (and Judaism) from most 
Oriental religions, it seems to me, is this revolutionary and prophetic 
element of confrontation with society. This element gives meaning and 
shape to history by presenting it with a dialectical meaning. From this 
point of view, the root of evil in human life cannot be adequately 
described as ignorance, or the cure for it correctly described as 
enlightenment. The record of human cruelty and folly is too hideous for 



Maps of meaning 392 


anything but the sense of a corrupted will to come near a diagnosis. Hence 
Jesus was not simply the compassionate Jesus as Buddha was the 
compassionate Buddha. His work, though it includes teaching the ways of 
enlightenment, does not stop there, but goes through a martyrdom and a 
descent into death. Two implications here are of especial importance for 
our present purpose. One, a specifically historical situation is latent in any 
“enlightenment”: man has to fight his way out of history and not simply 
awaken from it. Two, the ability to absorb a complete individual is, so far, 
beyond the capacity of any society, including those that call themselves 
Christian. 553 

Myth has come to encapsulate and express the essential nature of the exploratory, 
creative, communicative psyche, as manifested in behavior, as a consequence of 
observation and rerepresentation of that behavior, in the temporally summed, historically 
determined manner beginning with imitation and ending with verbal abstraction. To what 
end are all behaviors (and representations of those behaviors) archetypally subjugated? 
Toward establishment of a state—a spiritual kingdom —that allows the behavioral 
processes that transform and establish morality to flourish. Historical cultures, after all— 
at least those expressly open to change—organize behavior such that the self and the 
other are treated, in the ideal (implicit or explicit) with the respect due to the mediator of 
order and chaos. Moral action toward other and self therefore constitutes an “as if’ 
statement, from the perspective of the semantic system: the moral individual treats 
himself and others “as if’ recognizing, respecting and paying homage to the ultimate 
source of creative adaptation (the ultimate source of “the world”). Such behavior 
“unconsciously” presupposes identity between the individual and the savior—the 
archetypal redeemer, the culture-bearer, the divine hero. This is organization of 
incorporated behavior in accordance with recognition of the source of incorporated 
behavior. Establishment of such organization, however, poses threat to morality 
predicated strictly upon adherence to tradition. 

Heroic behavior compels imitation—a hero, by definition, serves as a model for 
emulation. The behavior of the culture-bearer, the archetypal hero, constitutes 
embodiment of an elaborate procedural code. This code is the end result of an 
evolutionary process, consisting of the establishment of creative behaviors, in the course 
of heroic endeavor, their subsequent communication in imitation and its abstract forms, 
and their integration, over time, into a consistent pattern of behavior, whose nature and 
expression constitutes the cultural character. This cultural character is the central 
“personality” of the healthy individual, embodied in procedure, secondarily represented 
in episodic and semantic memory. Ideally, this character tends toward harmonious 
balance between tradition and adaptation, and the needs of self and other. It is the 
constant attempt to accurately represent such character that constitutes the “aim” of the 
stories of humanity. 

As history progresses, becomes more “conscious” and differentiated—or, more 
accurately, as the presuppositions underlying adaptive social behavior become more and 
more accurately abstractly formulated (more declarative)—society moves from 
conceptualization of the consequences or productions of heroism as the ideal toward 
which behavior is to be devoted toward conceptualization of the act of heroism itself as 



The Hostile Brothers 393 


such an ideal. This is movement from product to process. This transformation in 
conceptualization is presented in dramatic form in the Western tradition in the New 
Testament’s description of the passion of Christ, which portrays the process and 
consequences of revolutionary restructuring of the axioms of Western morality. 

Christ has long been considered implicitly “contained” in the Old Testament. Frye 
comments: 

For Paul, Christ was mainly the concealed hero of the Old Testament 
story and the post-Easter Christ of the resurrection. The Gospels present 
Christ in a form that fits this pre-Gospel conception of him: not in a 
biographical form but as a discontinuous sequence of appearances in 
which Jesus comments on the Old Testament as a series of past events, 
laws and images coming permanently alive in the Messianic context, and 
body, which he supplies. 554 

What this means, at the most fundamental level of analysis, is that the pattern of action, 
imagination and thought that Christ represents is necessarily “there” in any narrative or 
mythology, sufficiently compelling to embed itself in memory. The reasons for this 
implicit existence are clear, in a sense: Christ embodies the hero, grounded in tradition, 
who is narrative depiction of the basis for successful individual and social adaptation. As 
the Word “made flesh” (John 1:14) there “in the beginning” (John 1:1), he represents, 
simultaneously, the power that divides order from chaos, and tradition rendered spiritual, 
abstract, declarative, semantic. His manner of being is that which moves morality itself 
from rule of law to rule of spirit—which means process. Spirit is process, simultaneously 
opposed to and responsible for generating static being. Frye states: 

We are told in the New Testament itself that the mysteries of faith have to 
be “spiritually discerned” (I Corinthians 2:14). This is in a passage where 
Paul is contrasting the letter, which he says “killeth,” with the spirit that 
“giveth life.” 555 

This idea is represented schematically in Figure 60: The Emergence of Christ from 
Group Identity and Chaos, which also portrays the Christian “story of man.” 

For Christ, “God is not the God of the dead, but of the living” (Matthew 22:32). Christ 
pushes morality beyond strict reliance on codified tradition—the explicit Law of 
Moses—not because such tradition was unnecessary, but because it was (and is) 
necessarily and eternally insufficient. He states: 

For I say unto you. That except your righteousness exceed the 
righteousness of the scribes and the Pharisees, ye shall in no case enter 
into the kingdom of heaven. (Matthew 5:20) 

but also 


Think not that I am come to destroy the law, or the prophets: I am not 
come to destroy, but to fulfil. (Matthew 5:17) 



Maps of meaning 394 


This means that identification with tradition is insufficient; that tradition cannot thereby 
be regarded as useless, but more in the light of a developmental precursor; and, finally, 
that the process that regenerates tradition is somehow implicitly contained and promoted 
in tradition itself. 

The role of Christ, who redeems culture from enslavement to the law, is prefigured at 
the end of Exodus, in the sequence including and continuing after the death of Moses (as 
discussed previously). Christ, in fact, appears as a second Moses, who offers a spiritual 
(intrapsychic) kingdom as the final version of the land promised to the Israelites by 
God. 556 



Figure 60: The Emergence of Christ from Group 
Identity and Chaos 

He is apparently granted the authority to make such an offer with the explicit 
collaboration of Moses—granted such power, like Moses, on high (as befits a “solar 
deity”): 


And after six days Jesus taketh Peter, James, and John his brother, and 
bringeth them up into an high mountain apart, 

And was transfigured before them: and his face did shine as the sun, 
and his raiment was white as the light. 






The Hostile Brothers 395 


And, behold, there appeared unto them Moses and Elias talking with 
him. 

Then answered Peter, and said unto Jesus, Lord, it is good for us to be 
here: if thou wilt, let us make here three tabernacles; one for thee, and one 
for Moses, and one for Elias. 

While he yet spake, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them: and 
behold a voice out of the cloud, which said, This is my beloved Son, in 
whom I am well pleased; hear ye him. 

And when the disciples heard it, they fell on their face, and were sore 
afraid. (Matthew 17:1-9) 

Like Moses, as well, Christ delivers his most famous address (which Frye interprets as a 
long commentary on the Decalogue) on a mountaintop. Frye notes that the Law of Moses 
is based upon prohibition, description of what is forbidden: “Thou shalt not.” By contrast, 
Christ’s message is more in the manner of exhortation, description of active good: “Thou 
shalt....” 557 This transformation is predicated upon development of heightened moral 
consciousness. In the beginning, for a soul steeped in sin, so to speak, it is an easier 
matter to identify what is evidently morally suspect, what should obviously be brought 
under personal control. Once a certain clarity of spirit is attained, as a consequence of 
conscientious, disciplined adherence to tradition, it becomes possible to determine what 
the good is, what should be done —rather than merely what should not. This contrast also 
serves as analogue to the relationship between adolescent and adult morality: strict group 
identity appropriately socializes the no longer properly dependent child, and allows him 
or her to make the leap from infancy to adulthood. The capacity to act in a disciplined 
manner—to follow the rules—is a necessary precondition to adult flexibility, but should 
not be contused with truly adult morality, which is the capacity to produce new sets of 
rules, with updated adaptive utility. This is also not to say, idiotically, that “Jewish” 
morality is adolescent, and “Christian” adult. Examples of prophetic “antagonism to 
tyrannical order” abound in the Old Testament, as we have seen. 558 The contrast is rather 
between the dogmatic and rigid and the creative and responsible within creeds, and not 
between the adherents of different creeds. 

Development of the list of law—the moral wisdom of the past, cast in stone—makes 
the extant procedural and episodic cultural structure explicitly “conscious” for the first 
time. The simplicity of the list makes it easily memorable, and accessible as a “shared 
point of reference.” The benefits of its abstraction—communicability and potential for 
rapid generalization—make it a potent force for the establishment and continuation of 
order. The list is nonetheless characterized by the presence of profound intrinsic 
structural limitations. It is of insufficient complexity to truly represent the nature of 
procedural morality (which is hierarchically organized, in a mutable and context- 
dependent fashion). It is unable to address suffering produced by conflict of duty—to 
define acceptable behavior when the situation compels conflicting behavioral response 
(when one listed moral prerequisite conflicts with another). The establishment of fixed 
law also limits capacity for judgment and choice, restricting adaptive flexibility, often 
dangerously, when “environmental alteration” makes such flexibility necessary: 



Maps of meaning 396 


Beware that no one lead you astray, saying, “Lo here!” or “Lo there!” For 
the Son of Man is within you. Follow after him. 

Those who seek him will find him. 

Go then and preach the gospel of the kingdom. 

Do not lay down any rules beyond what I appointed for you, and do not 
give a law like the lawgiver lest you be constrained by it. 559 560 

As a consequence of its intrinsic limitations, the list, which states what must not be, must 
give way, once fulfilled, to establishment of a more abstract form of moral order, 
predicated upon more flexible principles—which suggests what should be. 

Descriptions of Christ’s attempts to transcend the dangerous yet necessary limitations 
upon behavior imposed by adherence to the letter of the law take the form of narrative 
about paradox. It might be said that Christ presents (or is presented with) a series of 
Gordian knots—moral dilemmas—which emerge as an inevitable consequence of the 
structure of the list of laws. He plays a deadly serious game with the temporal 
representatives of then-traditional order, represented in the New Testament in the form of 
“Pharisees and scribes,” teasing them into koanlike conundrums, which emerge as a 
consequence of their own beliefs: 

And it came to pass on the second sabbath after the first, that he went 
through the corn fields; and his disciples did eat, rubbing them in their 
hands. 

And certain of the Pharisees said unto them, Why do ye that which is 
not lawful to do on the sabbath days? 561 

And Jesus answering them said, Have ye not read so much as this, 
what David did, when himself was an hungred, and they which were with 
him; 

How he went into the house of God, and did take and eat the 
shewbread, and gave also to them that were with him; which it is not 
lawful to eat but for the priests alone? 562 

And he said unto them, That the Son of man is Lord also of the 
sabbath. 

And it came to pass also on another sabbath, that he entered into the 
synagogue and taught: and there was a man whose right hand was 
withered. 

And the scribes and Pharisees watched him, whether he would heal on 
the sabbath day; that they might find an accusation against him. 

But he knew their thoughts, and said to the man which had the 
withered hand. Rise up, and stand forth in the midst. And he arose and 
stood forth. 

Then said Jesus unto them, I will ask you one thing: Is it lawful on the 
sabbath days to do good, or to do evil? to save life, or to destroy it? 

And looking round upon them all, he said unto the man, Stretch forth 
thy hand. And he did so: and his hand was restored whole as the other. 

And they were filled with madness; and communed one with another 
what they might do to Jesus. (Luke 6:1-11) 




The Hostile Brothers 397 


Similarly: 

And it came to pass, as he went into the house of one of the chief 
Pharisees to eat bread on the sabbath day, that they watched him. 

And, behold, there was a certain man before him which had the dropsy. 
And Jesus answering spake unto the lawyers and Pharisees, saying, Is 
it lawful to heal on the sabbath day? 

And they held their peace. And he took him, and healed him, and let 
him go; 

And answered them, saying, Which of you shall have an ass or an ox 
fallen into a pit, and will not straightway pull him out on the sabbath day? 
And they could not answer him these things. (Luke 14:1-6) 


Also: 


And as Jesus passed by, he saw a man which was blind from his birth. 

And his disciples asked him, saying. Master, who did sin, this man, or 
his parents, that he was born blind? 

Jesus answered, Neither hath this man sinned, nor his parents: but that 
the works of God should be made manifest in him. 

I must work the works of him that sent me, while it is day: the night 
cometh, when no man can work. 

As long as I am in the world, I am the light of the world. 

When he had thus spoken, he spat on the ground, and made clay of the 
spittle, and he annointed the eyes of the blind man with the clay. 

And said unto him. Go, wash in the pool of Siloam (which is by 
interpretation Sent). He went his way therefore, and washed, and came 
seeing. 

The neighbours therefore, and they which had seen him that he was 
blind, said. Is not this he that sat and begged? 

Some said. This is he: others said, He is like him: but he said, I am he. 

Therefore they said unto him. How were thine eyes opened? He 
answered and said, A man that is called Jesus made clay, and annointed 
mine eyes, and said unto me, Go to the pool of Siloam, and wash: and I 
went and washed, and I received sight. 

Then said they unto him. Where is he? He said, I know not. 

They brought to the Pharisees him that aforetime was blind. 

And it was the sabbath day when Jesus made the clay, and opened his 
eyes. 

Then again the Pharisees also asked him how he had received his sight. 
He said unto them, He put clay upon mine eyes, and I washed, and do see. 

Therefore said some of the Pharisees, This man is not of God, because 
he keepeth not the Sabbath day. Others said, How can a man that is a 
sinner do such miracles? And there was a division among them. 

They say unto the blind man again. What sayest thou of him, that he 
hath opened thine eyes? He said, He is a prophet. 



Maps of meaning 398 


But the Jews did not believe concerning him, that he had been blind, 
and received his sight, until they called the parents of him that had 
received his sight. 

And they asked them, saying, Is this your son, who ye say was born 
blind? how then doth he now see? 

His parents answered them and said, We know that this is our son, and 
that he was born blind. 

But by what means he now seeth, we know not; or who hath opened 
his eyes, we know not: he is of age; ask him: he shall speak for himself. 

These words spake his parents, because they feared the Jews: for the 
Jews had agreed already, that if any man did confess that he was Christ, 
he should be put out of the synagogue. 

Therefore said his parents, He is of age; ask him. 

Then again called they the man that was blind, and said unto him, Give 
God the praise: we know that this man is a sinner. 

He answered and said, Whether he is a sinner or no, I know not: one 
thing I know, that, whereas I was blind, now I see. 

Then said they to him again. What did he to thee? how opened he thine 
eyes? 

He answered them, I have told you already, and ye did not hear: 
wherefore would ye hear it again? will ye also be his disciples? 

Then they reviled him, and said, Thou art his disciple; but we are 
Moses’ disciples. 

We know that God spake unto Moses: as for this fellow, we know not 
from whence he is. (John 9:1-29) 


Also: 


Then came together unto him the Pharisees, and certain of the scribes, 
which came from Jerusalem, 

And when they saw some of his disciples eat bread with defiled, that is 
to say, with unwashen, hands, they found fault. 

For the Pharisees, and all the Jews, except they wash their hands oft, 
eat not, holding the tradition of the elders. 

And when they come from the market, except they wash, they eat not. 
And many other things there be, which they have received to hold, as the 
washing of cups, and pots, brasen vessels, and of tables. 

Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him. Why walk not thy disciples 
according to the tradition of the elders, but eat bread with unwashen 
hands? 

He answered and said unto them, Well hath Esias prophecied of you 
hypocrites, as it is written. This people honoureth me with their lips, but 
their heart is far from me. 

Howbeit in vain do they worship me, teaching for doctrines the 
commandments of men. (Mark 7:5-7) 



The Hostile Brothers 399 


Piaget—in what might be considered a veritable commentary on these stories— 
differentiates “morality of constraint” from “morality of cooperation,” 56 ' describing the 
former as a “system of rules” 564 that affective life makes use of to control behavior: 565 

Since he takes rules literally and things of good only in terms of 
obedience, the child will at first evaluate acts not in accordance with the 
motive that has prompted them but in terms of their exact conformity with 
established rules. 566 

Piaget associates morality of constraint with an earlier level of cognitive development—a 
level that nonetheless serves as a necessary precondition for further development. Piaget 
states: “For very young children, a rule is a sacred reality because it is traditional; for the 
older ones it depends upon mutual agreement.” 567 Joseph Rychlak comments: 

Younger children also are much harsher in assigning punishment to those 
who break the rules. They seem to want to emphasize the punishment for 
its own sake, whereas older children use punishment more to show the 
transgressor that a bond has been broken between people when a 
wrongdoing takes place. Piaget’s value system considers rule by 
cooperation a more satisfactory equilibration in human relations than rule 
by authority. In order for a rule to work without authority pressures, there 
must be feelings of mutual respect among the persons who subscribe to 
the rule. 568 This necessarily brings affectivity into considerations of 
morality. Authoritarian constraint rules through feelings of anxiety and 
fear, but when mutual respect exists among people, a morality of 
cooperation can occur. 569 

Morality of tradition is not predicated upon the same presumptions as morality of 
cooperation. Rigid traditionalists assume that the answer to the question “what is the 
good?” can be—has been—answered permanently, and concretely, with the list of laws. 
Such a list is always insufficient, however, for the purposes of complete adaptation. Lao- 
Tzu can therefore say, with sufficient justification: 

The man who is truly wise and kind 
leaves nothing to be done, 
but he who only acts 
according to his nation’s law 
leaves many things undone. 570 

Adherents of tradition rely on the attribution of superhuman value to ancestral figures 
and, equally to their current temporal and spiritual representatives. Those who embrace 
the morality of cooperation, by contrast, value the notion of “mutual respect”—which 
means simultaneous appreciation of equality and mutual value among individuals within 
(and, much more radically, between) social groups. 

The behavior of any given social group—and, therefore, the value attributed to 
phenomena that constitute the shared territory of the group—emerges as a consequence 



Maps of meaning 400 


of the necessity of maintaining balance between opportunity for expression of individual 
desire and restriction of inter-individual conflict. Such balance, vital to maintenance of 
group stability, is established long before the “rales” governing such establishment can 
be modeled in episodic or semantic memory, from the phylo- and onto-genetic 
perspectives. Even the simplest social animals erect a dominance hierarchy, and behave 
“as if’ according to principle. It is an error to presuppose, however, that simpler animals 
can abstractly represent either their behaviors—which is to say, form an imagistic model 
of them in imagination—or understand the “principles” that govern them. Likewise, 
socialized children, in complex human societies, embody the morality of their culture in 
their behavior long before they are able to abstractly represent or semantically describe 
rationale for that morality, and before they can consciously (episodically or semantically) 
remember learning how to behave. The same can be said for adults: the existence of 
morality—that intrinsic aspect of social behavior—long precedes representation of 
morality and rational description of grounds for its existence. Morality, at its most 
fundamental level, is an emergent property of social interaction, embodied in individual 
behavior, implicit in the value attributed to objects and situations, grounded 
(unconsciously) in procedural knowledge. 

Two questions arise naturally from such a discussion: “is it possible to abstract out 
from observation of social interaction the ‘rales’ or patterns that characterize such 
interactions?” and, if so, “what might those ‘rules’ be?” Primeval group culture 
determines the nature of social interaction among the members of the group, and brings 
general expectation, predictability, to encounters between differentially desirable, 
powerful and dangerous individuals in that group. The mere fact of a stable hierarchy 
implies the existence of a complex procedural morality (and an implicit system of 
values). The behavior of social animals, within a hierarchy, constitutes de facto 
recognition of complex moral “principles,” which might be regarded as the inevitable 
emergent properties of constant social interaction. It is very dangerous for the entire 
group if any of its members engage, routinely, in strenuous physical competition. 
Exhaustion—or outright elimination—of the power of the constituent members of the 
group means increased risk of attack from outside. Physical competition among social 
animals, necessary for dominance establishment, therefore generally has a ritualistic 
nature, and ends well before serious injury or death. Social animals have developed 
signals of submission, for example, which indicate their willingness to end the struggle 
for power. These signals are usually respected by the victor. The most powerful member 
of a given social group may come to dominate that group—at least in some 
circumstances—but the domination takes limited form. Even the most dominant of 
animals must act “as if’— as if their expression ofpower is constrained by recognition of 
the necessity for maintenance of the group and the individuals who constitute and sustain 
it. This constraint, partially manifested in social affection, provides the precondition for 
the emergence of complex abstract morality, which originates in innate and socialized 
procedural knowledge, which is “unconscious” in essence—that is, nonrepresentational, 
or undeclarable. It is not too difficult to recognize in this constraint the moral imperative 
“treat the weak as if they too are valuable”—as the Old Testament prophets insisted—or 
even—“love thy neighbour (even thy enemy) as thyself.” Consider Christ’s first sermon: 



The Hostile Brothers 401 


And he came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as his 
custom was, he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and stood up 
for to read. 

And there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet Esasias. And 
when he had opened the book, he found the place where it was written, 

The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath annointed me to 
preach the gospel to the poor; he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted, 
to preach deliverance to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, 
to set at liberty them that are bruised, 

To preach the acceptable year of the Lord. 

And he closed the book, and he gave it again to the minister, and sat 
down. And the eyes of all them that were in the synagogue were fastened 
on him. 

And he said unto them, This day is the scripture fulfilled in your ears. 

And all bare him witness, and wondered at the gracious words which 
proceeded out of his mouth. And they said, Is not this Joseph’s son? 

And he said unto them, Ye will surely say unto me this proverb, 
Physician, heal thyself: whatsoever we have heard done in Capernaum, do 
also here in thy country. 

And he said, Verily I say unto you. No prophet is accepted in his own 
country. 

But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in Israel in the days of 
Elias, when the heaven was shut up three years and six months, when 
great famine was throughout all the land; 

But unto none of them was Elias sent, save unto Sarepta, a city of 
Sidon, unto a woman that was a widow. 

And many lepers were in Israel in the time of Eliseus the prophet; and 
none of them was cleansed, saving Namaan the Syrian. 

And all they in the synagogue, when they heard these things, were 
filled with wrath. 

And rose up, and thrust him out of the city, and led him unto the brow 
of the hill whereon their city was built, that they might cast him down 
headlong. 

But he passing through the midst of them went his way, 

And came down to Capernaum, a city of Galilee, and taught them on 
the sabbath days. 

And they were astonished at his doctrine: for his word was with power. 
(Luke 4:14-32)

Then Jesus went hence, and departed into the coasts of Tyre and Sidon. 

And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts, and 
cried unto him, saying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, thou Son of David; 
my daughter is grievously vexed with a devil. 



Maps of meaning 402 


But he answered her not a word. And his disciples came and besought 
him, saying, Send her away; for she crieth after us. 

But he answered and said, I am not sent but unto the lost sheep of the 
house of Israel. 

Then came she and worshipped him, saying, Lord, help me. 

But he answered and said, It is not meet to take the children’s bread, 
and to cast it to dogs. 

And she said, Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall 
from their masters’ table. 

Then Jesus answered and said unto here, O woman, great is thy faith: 
be it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from 
that hour. (Matthew 15:21-28) 

The kingdom of heaven, as conceived of by Christ, was not only populated by the 
foreigner—an inclusion sufficiently unacceptable—but by all who were deemed 
superfluous or sinful according to the terms of prevailing morality: by the prostitute, the 
tax collector, the diseased, the insane and, most radically, by the enemy. This of course 
did not mean the end of morality—did not mean establishment of an anarchic 
“community” where everything was equal, and therefore equally valueless (where the 
practising and unrepentant torturer and the authentic saint share would be worthy of equal 
distinction)—but the portrayal of a state where the life of the past or the conditions of 
birth, no matter how wretched, did not finally determine the value of the present, or the 
possibilities of the future. 

The extremely radical nature of this viewpoint profoundly disturbed the traditionalists 
in Christ’s community. His example served as reproach to their actions; his philosophy, 
as threat to the integrity of their most dearly held positions. In consequence, they 
constantly attempted to trap him into making an irrevocably criminal or heretic statement. 
This strategy tended to backfire badly: 

Then went the Pharisees, and took counsel how they might entangle him 
in his talk. 

And they sent out unto him their disciples with the Herodians, saying, 

Master, we know that thou are true, and teachest the way of God in truth, 
neither carest thou for any man: for thou regardest not the person of men. 

Tell us therefore, What thinkest thou? Is it lawful to give tribute unto 
Caesar, or not? 

But Jesus perceived their wickedness, and said, Why tempt me, ye 
hypocrites? 

Shew me the tribute money. And they brought unto him a penny. 

And he saith unto them. Whose is this image and superscription? 

They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render 
therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar’s; and unto God the 
things that are God’s. 

When they heard these words, they marvelled, and left him, and went 
their way. (Matthew 22:15-22) 



The Hostile Brothers 403

And as he spake, a certain Pharisee besought him to dine with him: and he 
went in, and sat down to meat. 

And when the Pharisee saw it, he marvelled that he had not first 
washed before dinner. 

And the Lord said unto him. Now do ye Pharisees make clean the 
outside of the cup and the platter; but your inward part is hill of ravening 
and wickedness. 

Ye fools, did not he that made that which is without make that which is 
within also? 

But rather give alms of such things as ye have: and, behold, all things 
are clean unto you. 

But woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye tithe mint and rue and all manner 
of herbs, and pass over judgment and the love of God: these ought ye to 
have done, and not to leave the other undone. 

Woe unto you, Pharisees! for ye love the uppermost seats in the 
synagogues, and greetings in the markets. 

Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye are as graves 
which appear not, and the men that walk over them are not aware of them. 

Then answered one of the lawyers, and said unto him, Master, thus 
saying thou reproachest us also. 

And he said, Woe unto you also, ye lawyers! for ye lade men with 
burdens grievous to be borne, and ye yourselves touch not the burdens 
with one of your fingers. 

Woe unto you! for ye build the sepulchres of the prophets, and your 
fathers killed them. 

Truly ye bear witness that ye allow the deeds of your fathers: for they 
indeed killed them, and ye build their sepulchres. 

Therefore also said the wisdom of God, I will send them prophets and 
apostles, and some of them they shall slay and persecute: 

That the blood of all the prophets, which was shed from the foundation 
of the world, may be required of this generation; 

From the blood of Abel unto the blood of Zacharias, which perished 
between the alter and the temple: verily, I say unto you, it shall be 
required of this generation. 

Woe unto you lawyers! for ye have taken away the key of knowledge: 
ye entered not in yourselves, and them that were entering in ye hindered. 

And as he said these things unto them, the scribes and the Pharisees 
began to urge him vehemently, and to provoke him to speak of many 
things: 

Laying wait for him, and seeking to catch something out of his mouth, 
that they might accuse him. (Luke 11:33-54) 


Christ’s ability to weave his way through verbal traps continually inflamed the Pharisees, 
who attempted, with ever more sophistry, to corner him: 



Maps of meaning 404 


Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting 
him, and saying, 

Master, which is the great commandment in the law? 

Jesus said unto him. Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy 
heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. 

This is the first and great commandment. 

And the second is like unto it. Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself. 

On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets. 
(Matthew 22:35-40) 

However, the power of Christ’s unexpected answers—in conjunction with his evident 
mastery of traditional knowledge (Matthew 22:42-45)—temporarily silenced his critics: 

And no man was able to answer him a word, neither durst any man from 
that day forth ask him any more questions. (Matthew 22:46) 

Christ’s replies signified transition of morality from reliance on tradition to reliance on 
individual conscience—from rule of law to rule of spirit—from prohibition to 
exhortation. To love God means to listen to the voice of truth 571 and to act in accordance 
with its messages; to love thy neighbour, as thy self. This means, not merely to be 
pleasant, polite and friendly, but to attribute to the other a value equivalent to the value of 
the self—which, despite outward appearances, is a representative of God—and to act in 
consequence of this valuation. This transition means establishment of an active dynamic 
balance of competing subjectively based motivational demands, while maintaining and 
creatively modifying the social and natural environment. It means fulfillment of personal 
and interpersonal needs in accordance with meta-moral principles, rather than in 
accordance with the demands of power or dogmatic tradition. Thus, the process by which 
tradition is generated in brought into inevitable contrast with tradition itself: 

Suppose ye that I am come to give peace on earth? I tell you. Nay; but 
rather division: 

For from henceforth there shall be five in one house divided, three 
against two, and two against three. 

The father shall be divided against the son, and the son against the 
father: the mother against the daughter, and the daughter against the 
mother; the mother in law against her daughter in law, and the daughter in 
law against her mother in law. (Luke 12:51-53) 

This is most truly death of unthinking adherence to authority—for as in the archaic 
society, the past rules: 

In normal times, when culture is stable and the paternal canon remains in 
force for generations, the father-son relationship consists in handing down 
these values to the son and impressing them upon him, after he has passed 
the tests of initiation in puberty. Such times, and the psychology that goes 
with them, are distinguished by the fact that there is no father-son 



The Hostile Brothers 405 


problem, or only the barest suggestion of one. We must not be deceived 
by the different experience of our own “extraordinary” age. The 
monotonous sameness of fathers and sons is the rule in a stable culture. 

This sameness only means that the paternal canon of rites and institutions 
which make the youth an adult and the father an elder holds indisputed 
sway, so that the young man undergoes his prescribed transition to 
adulthood just as naturally as the father undergoes his to old age. 

There is, however, one exception to this, and the exception is the 
creative individual—the hero. As Barlach says, the hero has to “awaken 
the sleeping images of the future which can come forth from the night, in 
order to give the world a new and better face.” This necessarily makes 
him a breaker of the old law. He is the enemy of the old ruling system, of 
the old cultural values, and the existing court of conscience, and so he 
necessarily comes into conflict with the fathers. In this conflict the “inner 
voice,” the command of the transpersonal father or father archetype who 
wants the world to change, collides with the personal father who speaks 
for the old law. We know this conflict best from the Bible story of 
Jehovah’s command to Abraham: “Get thee out of thy country, and from 
thy kindred, and from thy father’s house, unto a land that I will show thee 
(Genesis 12:1), which the midrash (Bin Gorion, Sagen der Juden, Vol. II, 

“Die Erzvater,” XI) interprets as meaning that Abraham is to destory the 
gods of his father. The message of Jesus is only an extension of the same 
conflict, and it repeats itself in every revolution. Whether the new picture 
of God and the world conflicts with an old picture, or with the personal 
father, is unimportant, for the father always represents the old order and 
hence also the old picture current in his cultural canon. 572 

What principle is rule of spirit, rather than law, predicated upon? Respect for the innately 
heroic nature of man. The “unconscious” archaic man mimics particular adaptive 
behaviors—integrated, however, into a procedural structure containing all other adaptive 
behaviors, capable of compelling imitation, and accompanied by episodic/semantic 
representation, in myth. Pre-experimental cultures regard the act of initial establishment 
of adaptive behavior as divine first because it follows an archetypal and therefore 
transpersonal pattern—that governing creative exploration—and second because it 
compels imitation, and therefore appears possessed of power. All behaviors that change 
history, and compel imitation, follow the same pattern—that of the divine hero, the 
embodiment of creative human potential. For the primitive individual, it is the 
consequences of such heroism and the particular acts themselves that constitute the 
essence of the past. The process of imitation and abstracted variants thereof, however, 
allow for the nature of this essence to be continually clarified—until, finally, 
representation of abstracted but specific heroic actions give way to representation of the 
process of heroism, per se. At this point, it becomes possible for the creative individual to 
mimic, consciously incarnate, the process of world-redemption itself. 

Law is a necessary precondition to salvation, so to speak; necessary, but insufficient. 
Law provides the borders that limit chaos, and allows for the protected maturation of the 
individual. Law disciplines possibility, and allows the disciplined individual to bring his 



Maps of meaning 406 


or her potentialities—those intrapsychic spirits—under voluntary control. The law allows 
for the application of such potentiality to the task of creative and courageous existence— 
allows spiritual water controlled flow into the valley of the shadow of death. Law held as 
absolute, however, puts man in the position of the eternal adolescent, dependent upon the 
father for every vital decision; removes the responsibility for action from the individual, 
and therefore prevents him or her from discovering the potential grandeur of the soul. 
Life without law remains chaotic, affectively intolerable. Life that is pure law becomes 
sterile, equally unbearable. The domination of chaos or sterility equally breeds murderous 
resentment and hatred. 

Christ presented the kingdom of heaven (the archetypal goal) as a spiritual kingdom, 
which is to say, a psychological, then interpersonal, state. This state differed from the 
hypothetical promised land described in the Old Testament, in a number of vitally 
important manners. First, its construction was a matter of voluntarily chosen alteration in 
personal attitude and outlook, rather than a culmination of material labor and natural 
resource. Second, it was predicated upon revolutionary and paradoxical 
reconceptualization of the nature of the goal—of paradise itself. Christ’s life and words— 
as archetypal exemplars of the heroic manner of being—place explicit stress on the 
process of life, rather than upon its products. The point of a symphony is not its final 
note, although it proceeds inexorably to that end. Likewise, the purpose of human 
existence is not the establishment of some static, perfect manner of being—man would 
find such perfection intolerable, as Dostoyevsky was at pains to illustrate. Rather, human 
purpose is generation of the ability to concentrate on the innately interesting and 
affectively significant events of the present, with sufficient consciousness and clarity, to 
render concern about the past and future unnecessary. “Consider the lilies of the valley” 
says Christ, 

how they grow; they toil not, neither do they spin: 

And yet I say unto you. That even Solomon in all his glory was not 
arrayed like one of these. 

Wherefore, if God so clothe the grass of the field, which to day is, and 
to morrow is cast into the oven, shall he not much more clothe you, O ye 
of little faith? 

Therefore take not thought, saying What shall we eat? or, What shall 
we drink? or, Wherewithal shall we be clothed? 

for your Heavenly Father knoweth that ye have need of all these things. 

But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all 
these things shall be added unto you. 

Take therefore no thought for the morrow: for the morrow shall take 
thought for the things of itself. Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof. 
(Matthew 6:28-34) 

“Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof’ does not mean “live the life of the 
grasshopper instead of the ant, sing in the summer and starve in the winter,” but 
concentrate on the task at hand. Respond to error, when committed. Pay attention, and 
when your behavior produces a consequence you find intolerable, modify it —no matter 
what it takes to produce such a modification. Allow consciousness of your present 



The Hostile Brothers 407 


insufficiency to maintain a constant presence, so that you do not commit the error of 
pride, and become unbending, rigid, and dead in spirit. Live in hill recognition of your 
capacity for error—and your capacity to rectify such error. Advance in confidence and 
faith; do not shrink back, avoiding inevitable contact with the terrible unknown, to live in 
a hole that grows smaller and darker. 

The significance of the Christian passion is the transformation of the process by which 
the goal is to be attained into the goal itself: the making of the “imitation of Christ”—the 
duty of every Christian citizen—into the embodiment of courageous, truthful, 
individually unique existence: 

Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him 
deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. 

For whosoever will save his life shall lose it; and whosoever will lose 
his life for my sake shall find it. 

For what is a man profited, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose 
his own soul? or what shall a man give in exchange for his soul? 
(Matthew 16:24-26) 

Christ said, put truth and regard for the divine in humanity above all else, and everything 
you need will follow—not everything you think you need, as such thought is fallible, and 
cannot serve as an accurate guide, but everything actually necessary to render acutely 
(self) conscious life bearable, without protection of delusion and necessary recourse to 
deceit, avoidance or suppression, and violence. This idea is presented in imagistic form in 
Figure 61: World-Tree of Death and Redemption , 73 which portrays the “host” as the 
second fruit of the world-tree. Ingestion of the first fruit produced the fall; ingestion of 
the second redeems those who have fallen. The negative feminine, in the form of Eve, 
hands out the apple, in the form of a skull; the positive feminine, in the form of the 
church, distributes the wheaten wafers that characterize the redeemer. The incorporation 
of “Christ’s mystic body,” during the ritual of the mass, is dramatic representation of the 
idea that the hero must be incorporated into each individual—that everyone must partake 
of the essence of the savior. 

Existence characterized by such essence takes place, from the Oriental viewpoint, on 
the path of meaning, in Tao, balanced on the razor’s edge between mythic masculine and 
mythic feminine—balanced between the potentially stultifying safety of order, and the 
inherently

Figure 61: World-Tree of Death and Redemption 

destructive possibility of chaos. Such existence allows for introduction of sufficiently 
bearable meaning into blessed security; makes every individual a stalwart guardian of 
tradition and an intrepid explorer of the unknown; ensures simultaneous advancement 
and maintenance of stable, dynamic social existence; and places the individual firmly on 
the path to intrapsychic integrity and spiritual peace: 








The Hostile Brothers 409 


Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I 
will liken him to a wise man, which built his house upon a rock; 

And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and 
beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. 
(Matthew 7:24-25) 


The Alchemical Procedure and the Philosopher’s Stone 


Introductory Note 


Part One 

The western alchemists followed the scenario, known already in the 
Hellenistic period, of the four phases of the process of transmutation: that 
is, of the procurement of the Philosopher’s Stone. The first phase (the 
nigredo )—the regression to the fluid state of matter—corresponds to the 
death of the alchemist. According to Paracelsus, “he who would enter the 
Kingdom of God must first enter with his body into his mother and there 
die.” The “mother” is the prima materia, the massa confusa, the 
abyssus. 514 Certain texts emphasize the synchronism between the opus 
alchymicum and the intimate experience of the adept. “Things are 
rendered perfect by their similars and that is why the operator must take 
part in the operation.” 575 “Transform yourself from dead stones into living 
philosopher’s stones,” writes Dorn. According to Gichtel, “we not only 
receive a new soul with this regeneration but also a new Body. The Body 
is extracted from the divine word or from the heavenly Sophia.” That it is 
not solely a question of laboratory operations is proven by the insistence 
on the virtues and qualities of the alchemist: the latter must be healthy, 
humble, patient, chaste; he must be of free spirit and in harmony with his 
work; he must both work and meditate. 

For our purposes, it will be unnecessary to summarize the other 
phases of the opus. Let us note, however, the paradoxical 
character of the materia prima and of the Philosopher’s Stone. 
According to the alchemists, they both are to be found everywhere, 
and under all forms; and they are designated by hundreds of terms. 
To cite only a text of 1526, the Stone “is familiar to all men, both 
young and old; it is found in the country, in the village, and in the 
town, in all things created by God; yet it is despised by all. Rich and 
poor handle it every day. It is thrown into the street by servant 
maids. Children play with it. Yet no one prizes it, though, next to the 
human soul, it is the most beautiful and most precious thing upon 
earth [and has power to pull down kings and princes. Nevertheless, 
it is esteemed the vilest and meanest of earthly things....]” 576 It is 
truly a question of a “secret language” that is at once both the 
expression of experiences otherwise intransmissible by the 



Maps of meaning 410 


medium of ordinary language, and the cryptic communication of the 
hidden meaning of symbols. 

The Stone makes possible the identification of opposites. 577 It 
purifies and “perfects” the metals. It is the Arabic alchemists who 
imparted therapeutic virtues to the Stone, and it is through the 
intermediary of Arabic alchemy that the concept of the Elixir vitae 
arrived in the West. 578 Roger Bacon speaks of a “medicine which 
makes the impurities and all the corruptions of the most base metal 
disappear,” and which can prolong human life for several centuries. 
According to Arnold of Villanova, the Stone cures all ills and makes 
the old young. 

As regards the process for the transmutation of metals into gold, 
attested already in Chinese alchemy, it accelerates the temporal 
rhythm and thus contributes to the work of nature. As is written in 
the Summa Perfectionis, an alchemical work of the sixteenth 
century, “what Nature cannot perfect in a vast space of time we can 
achieve in a short space of time by our art.” The same idea is 
expounded by Ben Jonson in his play The Alchemist (Act 2, Scene 
2). The alchemist affirms that “lead and other metals... would be 
gold if they had time”; and another character adds: “And that our art 
doth further.” 579 In other words, the alchemist substitutes himself for 
Time. 

The principles of traditional alchemy—that is, the growth of 
minerals, the transmutation of metals, the Elixir, and the obligation 
to secrecy—were not contested in the period of the Renaissance 
and the Reformation. 581 However, the horizon of medieval alchemy 
was modified under the impact of Neoplatonism and Hermeticism. 

The certitude that alchemy can second the work of Nature received 
a christological significance. The alchemists now affirmed that just 
as Christ had redeemed humanity by his death and resurrection, so 
the opus alchymicum could assure the redemption of Nature. 
Heinrich Khunrath, a celebrated Hermeticist of the sixteenth 
century, identified the Philosopher’s Stone with Jesus Christ, the 
“Son of the Macrocosm”; he thought besides that the discovery of 
the Stone would unveil the true nature of the macrocosm, in the 
same way that Christ had brought spiritual plenitude to man—that 
is, to the microcosm. The conviction that the opus alchymicum 
could save both man and Nature prolonged the nostalgia for a 
radical renovatio, a nostalgia which had haunted western 
Christianity since Joachim of Floris. 582 

Carl Jung devoted a tremendous amount of attention to the writings of the alchemists in 
the latter part of his life. These efforts merely added fuel to the fire of those who had 
branded him eccentric, because of his interest in the psychology of religion (which is, 
after all, a fundamental aspect of human psychology and culture). Even the Pulitzer 
Prize-winning sociologist Ernest Becker, who was favorably (and critically) predisposed 



The Hostile Brothers 411 


to the claims of psychoanalytic thought, stated, “I can’t see that all [Jung’s] tomes on 
alchemy added one bit to the weight of his psychoanalytic insight.” 583 

Many people—some with an outstanding academic reputation—have cautioned me 
against discussing Jung, warned me about even mentioning his name in the academic 
context. This warning was presented, no doubt, with my best professional interests in 
mind. I once read a story about Paul Ricoeur, the French philosopher and literary critic, 
which may be apocryphal. Someone mentioned the specific relevance of Jung’s work to 
Ricoeur’s field of inquiry. Ricoeur replied, “I haven’t read Jung. He’s on the Index in 
France.” This ironical response was, of course, made in reference to the Catholic Index of 
books—a listing of readings forbidden to devout followers of that creed. 

I have never met someone, however, who actually understood what Jung was talking 
about and who was simultaneously able to provide valid criticism of his ideas. Often, 
Jung’s notions are confused with Freud’s—insofar as Freud’s are understood. Freud 
himself certainly did not make this error. It was in fact Freud’s apprehension of Jung’s 
profound and irreconcilable differences in thought that led to their professional and 
private alienation. 584 Jung’s ideas are not primarily Freudian. He places little emphasis on 
sexuality or on the role of past trauma in determining present mental state. He rejected 
the idea of the Oedipus complex (actually, he reinterpreted that complex in a much more 
compelling and complete manner). He viewed religion not as mere neurotic defense 
against anxiety, but as a profoundly important means of adaptation. It is much more 
accurate to view him as an intellectual descendant of Goethe and Nietzsche—influenced 
in his development, to be sure, by the idea of the unconscious—than as a Freudian 
“disciple.” 585 Jung in fact spent much of his life answering, and attempting to answer, 
Nietzsche’s questions about morality. 

Furthermore, Jung was not a “mystic.” He merely delved into areas that were 
forbidden, because of their religious association, to devout scientists, and was possessed 
of sufficient intellect and education to do so. It is incorrect, and evidence of one-sided 
thinking, to label him pejoratively. It is incorrect because Jung was, in fact, an 
experimental scientist of no small ability, particularly at the beginning of his career. 
Many of the word-association tests he helped pioneer are still used extensively, with 
some technical modifications (and little recognition of original source), in the fields of 
cognitive neuroscience and social psychology. The boxing and filing away of Jung is 
one-sided because experimental procedure constitutes, at best, one pole of the bipolar 
scientific process. A well-designed experiment allows for the testing of ideas, when it is 
undertaken properly. However, ideas to test must be generated—a truism often 
overlooked in the course of modern academic education. It was at this endeavor that Jung 
excelled. Some might object: his ideas cannot be tested. But they have been: the card- 
classification experiment by Jerome Bruner, described previously, 384 provides a classic 
and striking example (although the results of that experiment have not generally been 
interpreted from the perspective of Jung’s thought). Furthermore, one axis of the 
personality dichotomy he proposed—that of introversion-extroversion—has stood up 
well, appears robust, in the face of repeated experimental inquiry. 586 In addition, the 
“unconscious” is clearly frill of “complexes”—although now they go by different 
names. 587 Perhaps we will become sophisticated enough in the ftiture, in our ability to 
experiment, and in our understanding of Jung’s ideas, to test more of them.

Jung was primarily a physician, which meant that he was concerned with the 
promotion of mental health. He believed that such promotion was impossible—perhaps 
even counterproductive—in the absence of comprehension of value, and of the processes 
by which value is generated. His investigation into the nature of value led him to 
consideration of fantasy and myth. The world of value is a world in imagination, the 
internalized result of the historically determined social contract that provides fixed 
determination of affective and motivational significance. Apprehension of this fact led 
Jung to analysis of the fantasies generated by his seriously disturbed psychiatric patients, 
and comparison of these fantasies—which he was unwilling to define, a priori, as 
meaningless—with ideas generated by religious mystics from a variety of “primitive” and 
sophisticated cultures, with a vast body of literary produc-tions in the Eastern and 
Western traditions, with imagery generated in dreams (more than 25,000 dreams, by his 
own estimate) and by diligent investigation into alchemical symbolism. This cross- 
cultural and multidisciplinary approach to the problem of value seems at least empirical, 
if not experimental—and remains eminently reasonable, in the absence of more 
appropriate methodology. (In fact, the prominent sociobiologist E.O. Wilson has recently 
recommended adoption of such a “cross-level” analytical procedure in the guise of 
“consilience”—to unite the natural sciences, the social sciences and the humanities. 588 ) 

Jung’s ideas—particularly his “alchemical” ideas—have been inappropriately, unfairly 
and dangerously ignored. They have been ignored because his students were outside the 
academic mainstream (and, perhaps, because they were frequently women). They have 
been ignored because they present a serious challenge—an absolutely fatal challenge, in 
my estimation—to Freudian psychoanalytic preconceptions. They have been overlooked 
because Jung took the frightening and mysterious statements of religion seriously. He 
presumed that such statements, which guided human adaptation successfully for 
thousands of years, had some significance, some meaning. Jung’s ideas have remained 
unexamined because psychology, the youngest, most rational, and most deterministic of 
sciences, is most afraid of religion. They have been ignored, additionally, because they 
are difficult to understand, from the conceptual and affective points of view. What the 
ideas are is hard to specify, initially; what they signify, once understood, is emotionally 
challenging. Jung essentially described the nature of the “language” of imagination, that 
ancient process—of narrative, of the episodic memory system—which he thought of, 
fundamentally, as the collective unconscious. Comprehension of this language is perhaps 
more difficult than development of fluency in an foreign language, because such 
comprehension necessarily and inevitably alters modern moral presumption. It is this 
latter point that constitutes the core rationale for dismissal of Jung’s ideas. Jung was no 
less revolutionary, from the moral perspective, than Martin Luther; he may reasonably be 
considered a figure in the tradition of Luther. Furthermore, moral revolution is the most 
dreadfully uncomfortable of all intrapsychic and social processes. It is the frightening 
content of Jung’s thought that has led most fundamentally to its rejection. 

Jung essentially discovered, in the course of his analysis of alchemy, the nature of the 
general human pattern of adaptation, and the characteristic expression of that pattern, in 
fantasy, and affect. Specific representation of this pattern, in the narrower domain of 
scientific endeavor, was outlined much later—to much wider comprehension and 
academic acclaim—by Thomas Kuhn. Jung’s student Marie-Louise von Franz—who 
provided a cogent summary of Jung’s complex alchemical ideas—states: 



The Hostile Brothers 413 


If you read the history of the development of chemistry and particularly of 
physics, you will see that even...exact natural sciences [such as chemistry 
and physics] could not, and still cannot, avoid basing their thought 
systems on certain hypotheses. In classical physics, up to the end of the 
18th century, one of the working hypotheses, arrived at either 
unconsciously, or half-consciously, was that space had three dimensions, 
an idea which was never questioned. The fact was always accepted, and 
perspective drawings of physical events, diagrams, or experiments, were 
always in accordance with that theory. Only when this theory is 
abandoned does one wonder how such a thing could have ever been 
believed. How did one come by such an idea? Why were we so caught 
that nobody ever doubted or even discussed the matter? It was accepted as 
a self-evident fact, but what was at the root of it? Johannes Kepler, one of 
the fathers of modern or classical physics, said that naturally space must 
have three dimensions because of the Trinity! So our readiness to believe 
that space has three dimensions is a more recent offspring of the Christian 
trinitarian idea. 

Further, until now the European scientific mind has been possessed by 
the idea of causality, an idea hitherto accepted without question: 
everything was causal, and the scientific attitude was that investigations 
should be made with that premise in mind, for there must be a rational 
cause for everything. If something appeared to be irrational, it was 
believed that its cause was not yet known. Why were we so dominated by 
that idea? One of the chief fathers of natural sciences—and a great 
protagonist of the absoluteness of the idea of causality—was the French 
philosopher Descartes, and he based his belief on the immutability of 
God. The doctrine of this immutability of God is one of the Christian 
tenets: the Divinity is unchanging, there must be no internal contradictions 
in God, or new ideas or conceptions. That is the basis of the idea of 
causality! From the time of Descartes onwards this seemed so self-evident 
to all physicists that there was no question about it. Science had merely to 
investigate the causes, and we still believe this. If something falls down 
then one must find out why—the wind must have blown it, or something 
like that, and if no reason is discovered I am sure that half of you will say 
that we do not yet know the cause, but that there must be one! Our 
archetypal prejudices are so strong that one cannot defend oneself against 
them, they just catch us. 

The late physicist. Professor Wolfgang Pauli, frequently demonstrated 
the extent to which modern physical sciences are in a way rooted in 
archetypal ideas. For instance, the idea of causality as formulated by 
Descartes is responsible for enormous progress in the investigation of 
light, of biological phenomena, and so on, but that thing which promotes 
knowledge becomes its prison. Great discoveries in natural sciences are 
generally due to the appearance of a new archetypal model by which 
reality can be described; that usually precedes big developments, for there 



Maps of meaning 414 


is now a model which enables a much biller explanation than was hitherto 
possible. 

So science has progressed, but still, any model becomes a cage, for if 
one comes across phenomena difficult to explain, then instead of being 
adaptable and saying that the phenomena do not conform to the model and 
that a new hypothesis must be found, one clings to one’s hypotheses with 
a kind of emotional conviction, and cannot be objective. Why shouldn’t 
there be more than three dimensions, why not investigate and see where 
we get? But that people could not do. 

I remember a very good illustration given by one of Pauli’s pupils. You 
know that the theory of ether played a great role in the 17th and 18th 
centuries—namely, that there was a kind of great air-like pneuma in the 
cosmos in which light existed, etc. One day when a physicist at a 
Congress proved that the theory of ether was quite unnecessary, an old 
man with a white beard got up and in a quavering voice said: “If ether 
does not exist, then everything is gone”! This old man had unconsciously 
projected his idea of God into ether. Ether was his god, and if he did not 
have that then there was nothing left. The man was naive enough to speak 
of his ideas, but all natural scientists have ultimate models of reality in 
which they believe, just like the Holy Ghost. 

It is a question of belief, not of science, and therefore something which 
cannot be discussed, and people get excited and fanatical if you present 
them with a fact which does not fit the frame. 589 


Also: 


So the archetype is the promoter of ideas and is also responsible for the 
emotional restrictions which prevent the renunciation of earlier theories. It 
is really only a detail or specific aspect of what happens everywhere in 
life, for we could not recognize anything without projection; but it is also 
the main obstacle to the truth. If one meets an unknown woman, it is not 
possible to make contact without projecting something; you must make a 
hypothesis, which of course is done quite unconsciously: the woman is 
elderly and is probably a kind of mother figure, and a normal human 
being, etc. You make assumptions and then you have a bridge. When you 
know the person better, then many earlier assumptions must be discarded 
and you must admit that your conclusions were incorrect. Unless this is 
done, then you are hampered in your contact. 

At first, one has to project, or there is no contact; but then one should 
be able to correct the projection, and it is the same not only as regards 
human beings, but everything else also. The projection apparatus must of 
necessity work in us. Nothing can even be seen without the unconscious 
projection factor. That is why, according to Indian philosophy, the whole 
of reality is a projection—which it is, in a subjective matter of 
speaking. 590 



The Hostile Brothers 415 


The idea of projection—that is, the idea that systems of thought have “unconscious” 
axioms—is clearly related to the notion of “paradigmatic thinking,” as outlined by Kuhn, 
to wide general acclaim. Jung described the psychological consequences of paradigmatic 
thinking in great detail as well. He first posed the question—“What happens to the 
(paradigmatic) representational structure in someone’s mind (in the human psyche, in 
human society) when anomalous information, of revolutionary import, is finally accepted 
as valid?”—and then answered it (my summary): “What happens has a pattern; the 
pattern has a biological, even genetic, basis, which finds its expression in fantasy; such 
fantasy provides subject material for myth and religion. The propositions of myth and 
religion, in turn, help guide and stabilize revolutionary human adaptation.” These 
answers have been rejected prematurely and without sufficient consideration. 


Part Two 

Where is what you most want to be found? 
Where you are least likely to look. 
“In sterquiliniis invenitur” 591 


King Arthur’s knights sit at a round table, because they are all equal. They set off to look 
for the Holy Grail—which is a symbol of salvation, container of the “nourishing” blood 
of Christ, keeper of redemption. Each knight leaves on his quest, individually. Each 
knight enters the forest, to begin his search, at the point that looks darkest to him. 

When I was about hallway through writing this manuscript, I went to visit my sister- 
in-law and her family. She had a son—my nephew—who was about five years old, very 
verbal and intelligent. He was deeply immersed in a pretend world and liked to dress up 
as a knight, with a plastic helmet and sword. 

He was happy during the day, to all appearances, but did not sleep well, and had been 
having nightmares for some time. He would regularly scream for his mom in the middle 
of the night, and appeared quite agitated by whatever was going on in his imagination. 

I asked him one morning after he had woken up what he had dreamed about. He told 
me, in the presence of his family, that dwarflike, beaked creatures who came up to his 
knees had been jumping up at him and biting him. Each creature was covered with hair 
and grease, and had a cross shaved in the hair on the top of its head. The dream also 
featured a dragon, who breathed fire. After the dragon exhaled, the fire turned into the 
dwarves, who multiplied endlessly, with each breath. He told the dream in a very serious 
voice to his parents and to my wife and me, and we were shocked by its graphic imagery 
and horror. 

The dream occurred at a transition point in my nephew’s life. He was leaving his 
mother to go to kindergarten, and was joining the social world. The dragon, of course, 
served as symbol for the source of fear itself—the unknown, the uroboros —while the 
dwarves were individual things to be afraid of, particular manifestations of the general 
unknown. 

I asked him, “What could you do about this dragon?” 

He said, without hesitation, and with considerable excitement, “I would take my dad, 
and we would go after the dragon. I would jump on its head, and poke out its eyes with

my sword. Then I would go down its throat, to where the fire came out. I would cut out 
the box the fire came from, and make a shield from it.” 

I thought this was a remarkable answer. He had reproduced an archaic hero myth, in 
perfect form. The idea of making a shield from the firebox was nothing short of brilliant. 
This gave him the power of the dragon to use against the dragon. 

His nightmares ended then and did not return, even though he had been suffering from 
them almost every night for a number of months. I asked his mother about his dreams, 
more than a year later, and she reported no further disturbance. 

The little boy, guided by his imagination, adopted identification with the hero, and 
faced his worst nightmare. If we are to thrive, individually and socially, each of us must 
do the same. Our great technological power makes the consequences of our individual 
errors and weaknesses increasingly serious; if we wish to continually expand our power, 
we must also continually expand our wisdom. This is, unfortunately, a terrible thing to 
ask. 

“In sterquiliniis invenitur "—in filth it will be found. This is perhaps the prime 
“alchemical” dictum. What you need most is always to be found where you least wish to 
look. This is really a matter of definition. The more profound the error, the more difficult 
the revolution—the more fear and uncertaintly released as a consequence of restructuring. 
The things that are most informative are also frequently most painful. Under such 
circumstances, it is easy to run away. The act of running away, however, transforms the 
ambivalent unknown into that which is too terrifying to face. Acceptance of anomalous 
information brings terror and pos-sibility, revolution and transformation. Rejection of 
unbearable fact stifles adaptation and strangles life. We choose one path or another at 
every decision point in our lives, and emerge as the sum total of our choices. In rejecting 
our errors, we gain short-term security—but throw away our identity with the process that 
allows us to transcend our weaknesses and tolerate our painfully limited lives: 

There was a good man who owned a vineyard. He leased it to tenant 
farmers so that they might work it and he might collect the produce from 
them. He sent his servant so that the tenants might give him the produce 
of the vineyard. They seized his servant and beat him, all but killing him. 

The servant went back and told his master. The master said, “Perhaps they 
did not recognize him.” He sent another servant. The tenants beat this one 
as well. Then the owner sent his son and said, “Perhaps they will show 
respect to my son.” Because the tenants knew that it was he who was heir 
to the vineyard, they seized him and killed him. Let him who has ears 
hear. 

Jesus said, “Show me the stone which the builders have rejected. That 
one is the cornerstone.” 592 

Face what you reject, accept what you refuse to acknowledge, and you will find the 
treasure that the dragon guards. 


The “Material World” as Archaic “Locus of the Unknown” 

All these myth pictures represent a drama of the human psyche on the 
further side of consciousness, showing man as both the one to be 



The Hostile Brothers 417 


redeemed and the redeemer. The first formulation is Christian, the sec 
ond alchemical. In the first case man attributes the need of redemption 
to himself and leaves the work of redemption.. .to the autonomous 
divine figure; in the latter case man takes upon himself the redeeming 
opus, and attributes the state of suffering and consequent need of 
redemption to the anima mundi (world spirit) imprisoned in matter. 593 


Alchemy can be most simply understood as the attempt to produce the philosopher’s 
stone—the lapis philosophorum. The lapis philosophorum had the ability to turn “base” 
metals into gold; furthermore, it conferred upon its bearer immortal life, spiritual peace 
and good health. The alchemical “procedure” stretched some twenty centuries, in the 
West, coming to an end with Newton; it had an equally lengthy and elaborate history in 
the Orient. 

It is impossible to understand the essence of alchemical thought—or its relevance for 
modem psychology—without entering into the categorical system of the alchemist. The 
“stuff’ with which the alchemist worked, although bearing the same name, was only 
vaguely akin to our modern matter. There are many ways to cut the world up, and they 
are not necessarily commensurate. Much of what the alchemist considered “thing” we 
would not think of as characteristic of the objective world; furthermore, what he 
considered unitary we would think of as evidently diverse. There are two major reasons 
for this difference in opinion. 

First: the categorical system used to parse up the world derives its nature in large part 
from the nature of the end toward which activity is currently devoted. The ends pursued 
by the alchemist were by no means identical to those considered worthwhile today. In 
large part, they were much more comprehensive (the “perfection of nature”); in addition, 
they were “contaminated” with psychological formulations (the “redemption” of 
“corrupt” matter). Insofar as the alchemical procedure was psychological—that is, driven 
by apprehension of an “ideal state”—the categories it produced were evaluative. 
Phenomena that emerge in the course of goal-directed behavior are classified most 
fundamentally with regard to their relevance, or irrelevance, to that end. Those that are 
relevant are further discriminated into those that are useful and “good,” and those that 
exist as impediments and are “bad.” Since our behavior is motivated—since it serves to 
regulate our emotions—it is very difficult to construct a classification system whose 
elements are devoid of evaluative significance. It is only since the emergence of strict 
empirical methodology that such construction has been made possible. This means that 
pre-experimental systems of classification such as those employed in the alchemical 
procedure include evaluative appraisal, even when they consist of terms such as “matter” 
or “gold” that appear familiar to us. 

Second: it seems that the more poorly something has been explored, the broader the 
category used to “encapsulate” or describe it. As exploration proceeds, finer 
discrimination becomes possible. Apparently unitary things fall apart, in this manner, into 
their previously implicit constituent elements (as nature is “carved at her joints”). We no 
longer consider the traditional four elements of the world, for example—fire, water, earth 
and air—either as irreducible elements or even as categories extant at the same level of 
analysis. Further investigation has reconfigured our systems of classification; we have 



Maps of meaning 418 


transformed the comparative simple “material world” of our ancestors into something 
much more complex, useful and diverse. We believe, in consequence, that the primordial 
elements of the world were not really elements at all (failing to realize that an element is 
a tool, and that an incompletely fashioned tool is still much better than no tool at all). 

The overwhelmingly evaluative dimension of pre-experimental classification, in 
combination with relatively poor capacity for discrimination, produced archaic categories 
of great generality—from the modern perspective. We can identify many “discriminable 
phenomena” within each of these categories, as a consequence of the centuries of 
increasingly efficient exploration that separate us from our medieval and pre-medieval 
forebears. Our viewpoint has in fact changed to such a degree that our use of the same 
word is in many cases only a historical accident. We might therefore make this discussion 
more concrete by first examining the “matter” of the alchemist, and by comparing it to 
what we think of as matter. 

Alchemical matter was the “stuff’ of which experience was made—and more: the 
stuff of which the experiencing creature was made. This “primal element” was something 
much more akin to “information” in the modern sense (or to Tao, from the Oriental 
perspective); something like matter in the phrases “that matters’ ,594 (that makes a 
difference, that we care about, that cannot be ignored, that is informative ) or “what is the 
matter ?” We derive “information” as a consequence of our exploratory behavior, 
undertaken in the “unknown,” attending to things that matter, from that information, we 
build ourselves (our behaviors and schemas of representation) and the “world,” as 
experienced. As Piaget states: 

Knowledge does not begin in the I, and it does not begin in the object; it 
begins in the interactions.... then there is a reciprocal and simultaneous 
construction of the subject on the one hand and the object on the other. 595 

The primal element of alchemy was something embedded or implicit in the world: 
something often hidden that could emerge unexpectedly. This unexpected emergence can 
be regarded as the “capacity” of the object to “transcend” its categorical representation 
(to “become” something new) as a consequence of its position in a new situation, or its 
“reaction” to a new exploratory procedure. This new thing “announces itself’ first in 
terms of the affect it generates: failure of the previously understood (previously 
categorized) thing to behave as predicted elicits emotion from the observer. This is the 
“spirit of transformation” making itself manifest. The emotion so generated—fear/hope— 
may produce exploratory behavior, designed to specify the “new” properties of the 
transforming object. These new properties then become incorporated into the previous 
categorization system—become “attributes” now seen as “in the same class”; 
alternatively, the newly transformed substance may have to “shift categories” because it 
is now seen as so much different from “what it was.” (The former case constitutes a 
normal shift, of course; the latter is revolutionary.) 

When a novel thing has been explored, and placed within a certain sociohistorically 
determined context, it has been classified in accordance with its currently evident 
motivational status: promise, threat, satisfaction, punishment (or none of the above), as 
determined, situationally. This is evidently true with regards to the classification system 
of the individual animal, who cannot derive an empirical model of reality, because it 



The Hostile Brothers 419 


cannot communicate—but equally true with regard to man, whose capacity for 
abstraction has blurred the essential nature and purpose of classification. What a thing is 
is most fundamentally its motivational significance—its relevance for the attainment of 
some affectively significant goal. Classification of the phenomenon (which means, 
determination of how to act in its presence) restricts its motivational significance to a 
particular domain (most frequently, to nothing, to irrelevance). Nonetheless, it is a fact 
that the phenomenon itself (which is of infinite complexity) is always capable of 
transcending its representation. This capacity for transcendence is a property of the 
“object” (a property of experience, from the phenomenological viewpoint), but can be 
exploited by the activity of man. 

The alchemists regarded the “transcendent capacity of the object”—that is, the 
capacity of the familiar and explored in one context to become the unfamiliar and 
unexplored in another—as a spirit, embedded in matter. Jung cites Basilius Valentinus, 
an ancient alchemical authority: 

The earth as material is not a dead body, but is inhabited by a spirit that is 
its life and soul. All created things, minerals included, draw their strength 
from the earth-spirit. This spirit is life, it is nourished by the stars, and it 
gives nourishment to all the living things it shelters in its womb. Through 
the spirit received from on high, the earth hatches the minerals in her 
womb as the mother her unborn child. This invisible spirit is like the 
reflection in a mirror, intangible, yet it is at the same time the root of all 
the substances necessary to the alchemical process or arising therefrom. 596 

The “spirit that inhabits the earth” was Mercurius, the shape-shifter (the reflected image 
of God in matter, 597 from the alchemical viewpoint) who both “guided” the alchemical 
process and was “released” by the activities of the alchemist. Mercurius was the spirit 
that made the “matter” investigated by the adept interesting, compelling—and interest is 
a “spirit” that moves from place to place, as knowledge changes and grows. Mercurius is 
the incarnation of transformation, the uroboros, who existed (and did not exist) as the 
most primal deity, before the creation of things (before the division of the world into 
subject and object, spirit and matter, known and unknown). The uroboros is, of course, 
the tail-eater, the dragon of chaos: an image of the embeddedness of the totality of things 
across time, in the particular manifest phenomenon. The image of the spirit Mercurius 
was an intimation of the infinite potential “trapped” in every particular aspect of 
experience. 598 Identification of this “potential”—that is, its classification—posed a 
constant problem to the medieval imagination: 

All through the Middle Ages [Mercurius] was the object of much puzzled 
speculation on the part of the natural philosophers: sometimes he was a 
ministering and helpful spirit, an [assistant, comrade or familiar]; and 
sometimes the servus or cervus fugitivus (the fugitive slave or stag), an 
elusive, deceptive, teasing goblin who drove the alchemists to despair and 
had many of his attributes in common with the devil. For instance he is 
dragon, lion, eagle, raven to mention only the most important of them. In 
the alchemical hierarchy of gods Mercurius comes lowest as prima 



Maps of meaning 420 


materia and highest as lapis philosophorum. The spiritus mercurialis is 
the alchemists’ guide (Hermes Psychopompos), and their tempter: he is 
their good luck and their ruin. 599 

The alchemists conflated what we would think of as matter with what we might regard as 
the unknown. This is hardly surprising, since “matter” was the unknown to the pre- 
scientific mind (and is still something that retains much of its mystery today). As the 
unknown, matter possessed an attraction, which was the affective valence of what had not 
yet been explored. The ability of the unknown to “attract” provided impetus for its 
personification as “spirit”—as that which motivates or directs. Matter—even in its 
modern form—can easily revert to the unknown, even under modern conditions; can then 
exercise a similar force (that of a “stimulus”) on the modern psyche. It does so, for 
example, when it manifests something anomalous—some unforeseen property, as a 
consequence of its placement in a new context, or its subjection to more creative 
exploration. The anomalous manifestation—the recurrence of the unknown—comes 
inevitably to attract increasing interest (or, conversely, attracts attempts to avoid, 
suppress or otherwise conjure it out of existence). All objects, even “explored objects,” 
retain their connection with “that from which all things are made,” even after they have 
been boxed and filed away (been categorized), in theory, “once and for all.” 

Take a rat, for example, who has habituated to a cage (who has explored the cage and 
become comfortable there). If a small object—say, an iron block—is dropped in front of 
it, it will first freeze, and then cautiously begin to investigate. The rat will use its capacity 
for motoric action to interact with the block—smelling it, looking at it, scratching it, 
perhaps gnawing it—to assess the motivational significance of the novel object. For the 
rat, limited by its lack of communicative ability to its own experience, limited by its 
restricted animal nature to fundamental processes of exploration, the block soon becomes 
irrelevant. It signifies no danger, in the course of interaction; it cannot be eaten; it is 
useless as nesting material. The block therefore “becomes” its lack of relevant properties 
for the no-longer-exploratory rat, and will henceforth be ignored. The process of 
exploration-predicated classification has eliminated the motivational significance of the 
novel—as is its function. From the mythic perspective, this is replacement of the “Great 
Mother” by the “Great Father”; replacement of ambivalent threat and promise by 
determinate valence (including irrelevance). 

The sensory properties of the block—which are the relevant features of the object, as 
far as the spirit of scientific inquiry extends—have no intrinsic importance for the rat, 
except as they signify something of affective import. This more fundamental mode of 
thought, concerned with behavioral adaptation to circumstance, is how man thought, prior 
to the formalization of scientific methodology—and how man thinks still, insofar as he 
values and acts. The general case is, however, more complex. Homo sapiens is capable of 
observing a practically infinite series of novel properties emerge from the particular 
object, because he is capable of apprehending an object from a virtually unlimited 
number of points of perspective, spatial and temporal—or, it might be considered, 
equivalently, that the “object” is something so complex that it can manifest entirely 
different properties, merely in consequence of being viewed from alternative 
perspectives. The iron block was once, “of its own accord,” something qualitatively 
different from what it is now, and will be something different, once again, in the future. 



The Hostile Brothers 421 


In the earliest stages of its existence, considered as an independent object, the exemplary 
block was part of an undifferentiated totality, prior to the beginning of all things; then, 
the interplay of four fundamental forces; then simple hydrogen, coalescing into a star; 
then, matter transformed by gravity and nuclear processes; then a stone on Earth; finally, 
something transformed by man—with a still uncompleted and equally extensive 
developmental history before it. This transformation of the object is temporality itself— 
the manifestation of Tao, the flux of being. The capacity of human beings to apprehend 
variable spatial-temporal spans “turns” the object into something more complex than its 
mere present appearance; this increase in “complexity” is compounded by the extended 
active capacity for exploration also typical of our species. 

What is an iron block for man? Shaped, a spear, and therefore food and death and 
security; suspended, a pendulum, key to detection of the earth’s rotation; dropped, 
significant of gravity; reduced to its constituent particles, with sufficient patience and 
ingenuity, representative of molecular and atomic structure—a part like the whole. The 
question might be more accurately presented—what is an iron block not, for man? The 
pre-experimental mind of the alchemist, pondering the nature of the prima materia —the 
“fundamental constituent element of experience”—easily became possessed by 
intimations of the infinite possibility of “matter”: of the boundless significance of the 
finite object; of the endless utility of the object and its inexhaustible capacity to reveal 
(become) the unknown. 

When an object is explored, its motivational significance is constrained [generally, as 
a consequence of the specific goal-directed nature of the exploratory process, inevitably 
predicated upon a specific hypothesis—is this thing good for (a particular function?—but 
not any number of other potential functions)]. The question in mind, implicit or explicitly 
formulated, determines in part the answer “given” by the object. The object is always 
capable of superseding the constraint, in some unpredictable fashion. This infinite 
potential finds its symbolic expression in the self-devouring serpent, the mercurial spirit 
of transformation—the spirit that draws interest inexorably to itself. 

While considering these ideas, I dreamed that a small object was 
traveling above the surface of the Atlantic Ocean. It moved along in 
the center of a procession of four immense hurricanes, configured 
as a square divided into quadrants, one hurricane per quadrant, 
tracked by satellites, monitored carefully and apprehensively by 
scientists manning the latest in meteorological equipment, in 
stations all over the world. 

The dream scene shifted. The object, a sphere of about eight 
inches in diameter, was now contained and exhibited in a small 
glass display case, like that found in a museum. The case itself 
was in a small room, with no visible exit or entry points. The 
American president, symbol of social order, and the crippled 
physicist Stephen Hawking, representative of scientific knowledge 
(and of disembodied rationality), were in the room with the object. 

One of them described the features of the room. Its walls were 
seven feet thick and made of some impervious substance [titanium 
dioxide (?)]—which sounded impressive in the context of the 



Maps of meaning 422 


dream. These walls were designed to permanently contain the 
object. I wasn’t in the room, although I was there as an observer, 
like the audience in a movie. The object in the display case 
appeared alive. It was moving, and distorting its shape, like a 
chrysalis or a cocoon in its later stages of development. At one 
point, it transformed itself into something resembling a 
meerschaum pipe. Then it re-formed itself into a sphere, and shot 
out through one wall of the case, and the room, leaving two 
perfectly round, smooth holes—one in the case, and the other in 
the wall. It left with no effort whatsoever, as if the barriers designed 
to restrain its movement were of no consequence, once the 
“decision”had been made. 

The object was an image of God, the uroboric serpent, 
embodied in matter (powerful enough to require the 
accompaniment of four hurricanes, as attendants) 600 The room 
was a classification system, something designed (by the most 
powerful representatives of the social and scientific worlds) to 
constrain the mysterious phenomenon. The object transformed 
itself into a pipe in reference to the famous painting (by Magritte) of 
a pipe, entitled (in translation) “This is not a pipe”—the map is not 
the territory, the representation not the phenomenon. The capacity 
of the object to escape, “at will, ” referred to the eternal 
transcendence of the phenomenal world, of its infinite capacity to 
unexpectedly supersede its representation, scientific and mythic. 

I dreamed, much later (perhaps after a year) of a man 
suspended, equidistant from the floor, ceiling and walls, in a cubic 
room—about arms length from each. The surfaces of the cube 
curved inward, toward the man (as if the room was constructed of 
the intersection of six spheres). All surfaces of the cube remained 
at the same distance from the man, regardless of his pattern of 
movement. If he walked forward, the cube moved forward with him. 
If he walked backward, the cube moved backward, at precisely the 
same rate, with no discontinuity whatsoever. The surfaces 
themselves were covered with circular patterns, about four inches 
in diameter, inscribed within squares of about the same size. Out of 
the center of each circle dangled the tip of a reptile’s tail. The man 
could reach in any direction, grasp a tail, and pull it out of the 
surface, into the room. 

This dream referred to the capacity of man to (voluntarily) pull 
the future into the present. The serpent—evident only in the form of 
his tail —was the uroboros, embedded implicitly in the phenomenal 
world , 601 The potential for the emergence of something new was 
present in every direction the man could look, inside the cube. He 
could determine what aspect of being would reveal itself, as a 
consequence of his voluntary action. 



The Hostile Brothers 423 


The act of exploration produces/elicits discriminable phenomena. These phenomena are 
mapped by the episodic and semantic “memory” systems. The exploratory process, 
however, is guided by the maps produced by the episodic system—particularly by its 
maps of the future. A desired end is posited, in fantasy. The motoric/abstract exploration 
system endeavors to bring about a match between emergent phenomena (produced in the 
course of activity) and that “map of the desired future.” Mismatches between production 
and goal elicit (re)appearance of “the base matter of the world”—the unknown, manifest 
in negative affect, and curiosity. 

The individual attempts to transform his wishes (rooted, in the final analysis, in 
emotion) into reality, suffering—and learning—when that process is disrupted. 
Exploration is deemed sufficient and may justly come to an end when the current 
affective state is deemed optimal: when knowledge, translated into action, has adjusted 
the world such that it is (once again) “paradisal.” In the absence of such a paradisal state 
(in the absence of current security, happiness), exploration is or has been, by definition, 
incomplete. The “residual mysteries” that still accompany current being—which manifest 
themselves in the intrinsic attractiveness of the thing or situation—must therefore become 
the focus of active attention, so that the “information” embedded in them can be “pulled 
out,” and transformed into subjective being and the world. The alchemical “base matter” 
of the world was, therefore, “the stuff of which determinate experience (subject and 
object) was made”; was something, in addition, capable of endless transformation; was 
something, finally, “corrupt”—as the material world was corrupt—incomplete, 
unrealized, fallen and suffering. 

Analysis of the pre-experimental category of “gold” helps shed light on the relevance, 
importance and meaning of this archaic complex of undiscriminated ideas. Gold, as 
ultimate contrast to mere base matter, was the ideal, as it could be perceived in the 
concrete world. For the pre-experimental man, as well as for the modern, gold served as a 
medium of economic exchange. But the value of the metal did not, and still does not, 
consist solely in its economic utility. Gold has always been associated, in episodic 
representation, with divinity. Prior to development of the scientific worldview, this 
association made perfect sense. Gold, in contrast to “lesser” metals or substances, does 
not tarnish, dull or rust. It therefore appears imperishable, “immortal” and incorruptible. 
Gold is rare, rather than common. It shines like the sun, the evident source of life. The 
“category” of gold therefore tended to subsume everything Apollonian, sunlike, divine 
(in the patriarchal/heroic sense we have become familiar with). Jung describes the 
characteristic presumptions of the alchemist Michael Maier: 

The sun, by its many millions of revolutions, spins the gold into the earth. 

Little by little the sun has imprinted its image on the earth, and that image 

is the gold. The sun is the image of God, the heart is the sun’s image in 

man, just as gold is the sun’s image in the earth, and God is known in the 

_. . 602 


The light of the sun is a “symbol” of power and the transcendence of clarity and 
consciousness, of heroism and permanence, and of victory over the forces of darkness, 
disintegration and decay. The earliest patriarchal gods and leaders of men combined the 



Maps of meaning 424 


life-giving attributes of the sun with the heroic ideals of man, and the coins that bore their 
likeness were round and golden, in imitation of the solar disk. 

Gold was, furthermore, the ideal end toward which all ores progressed—was the target 
of material progression. As it “ripened” in the womb of the earth, lead, for example, base 
and promiscuous [willing to “mate” (combine) with many other substances], aimed at the 
state characterized by gold, perfect and inviolable. This made the “gold state” the goal of 
the Mercurial “spirit of the unknown,” embedded in matter. Eliade states: 

If nothing impedes the process of gestation, all ores will, in time, become 
gold. “If there were no exterior obstacles to the execution of her designs,” 
wrote a Western alchemist, “Nature would always complete what she 
wished to produce....” That is why we have to look upon the births of 
imperfect metals as we would on abortions and freaks which come about 
only because Nature has been, as it were, misdirected, or because she has 
encountered some fettering resistance.... 

Belief in the natural metamorphosis of metals is of very ancient origin 
in China and it is also found in Annum, in India and in the Indian 
archipelago. The peasants of Tonkin have a saying: “Black bronze is the 
mother of gold.” Gold is engendered naturally by bronze. But this 
transmutation can materialize only if the bronze has lain a sufficiently 
long period in the bosom of the earth. 603 

The alchemist viewed himself as midwife to nature—bringing to fruition what nature 
endeavored slowly to produce—and therefore as aid to a transformation aimed at 
producing something ideal. “Gold” is that ideal. Eliade continues: 

The “nobility” of gold is thus the fruit at its most mature; the other metals 
are “common” because they are crude; “not ripe.” In other words, 
Nature’s final goal is the completion of the mineral kingdom, its ultimate 
“maturation.” The natural transmutation of metals into gold is inscribed in 
their destiny. The tendency of Nature is to perfection. But since gold is the 
bearer of a highly spiritual symbolism (“Gold is immortality,” say the 
Indian texts repeatedly), it is obvious that a new idea is coming into being: 
the idea of the part assumed by the alchemist as the brotherly savior of 
Nature. He assists Nature to fulfil her final goal, to attain her “ideal,” 
which is the perfection of its progeny—be it mineral, animal or human— 
to its supreme ripening, which is absolute immortality and liberty. 604 

The alchemists lived in a world that had theoretically been redeemed by the sacrifice of 
Christ—at least from the Christian perspective. But they did not feel at all redeemed— 
they remained unsatisfied with the present still-too-mortal condition. So they turned their 
attention to those aspects of the world that had been defined, in accordance with 
prevailing morality, as “unworthy of examination,” as corrupt and contemptible. 
Presuming—or hoping—that things might yet be better, they explored (as we explore 
now, hoping to extract from the “unknown” new and useful tools). The alchemists 
assumed, implicitly, that further exploration might bring redemptive knowledge. This 



The Hostile Brothers 425 


search was driven by their admission of the “unbearable present,” by their identification 
with a “still-fallen world.” The alchemists believed that the “desirable transmutation of 
matter” could be brought about by the “release” of Mercurius from matter. This meant 
that they implicitly recognized that (interest-guided) exploration was key to the 
(redemptive) expansion of being. 

In participating in this process, the alchemists identified with the exploratory hero, and 
turned themselves unconsciously (that is, in procedure, if not always in representation) 
into “that which redeems.” This identification was complicated by the fact that the 
alchemist also considered himself as partaking of the state of matter—as belonging in the 
“state necessitating redemption.” This basically meant that the alchemist viewed himself, 
at least in part, as occupying the same category as “matter” (as well as being that which 
could become “gold,” and which could aid in that transformation). For the pre- 
experimental mind, with its more general and conflated categories, there is no necessary 
distinction between the “thing being acted on” and the “thing doing the acting.” Eliade 
describes, for example, the “sympathetic magic” necessary to complete a grafting 
operation between two different species of plants necessary (to induce “unlike to mate 
with unlike,” from a broader perspective): 

Ibn Washya—and he is not the only oriental writer to allow himself to be 
carried away by such images—speaks of fantastic graftings (“contrary to 
Nature”) between differing vegetable species. He says, for instance, that 
the grafting of a branch of a lemon tree on to a laurel or olive tree would 
produce very small lemons, the size of olives. But he makes it clear that 
the graft could succeed only if it was performed in the ritual manner and 
at a certain conjunction of the sun and moon. He explains the rite thus: 

“the branch to be grafted must be held in the hands of a very beautiful 
maiden, while a man is having shameful and unnatural sexual intercourse 
with her; during coitus the girl grafts the branch onto the tree.” The 
significance is clear: in order to ensure an “unnatural” union in the 
vegetable world an unnatural sexual union between human beings was 

605 

necessary. 

Such ideas are far from rare. Virtually every process undertaken by pre-experimental 
individuals—from agriculture to metallurgy—was accompanied by rituals designed to 
“bring about the state of mind” or “illustrate the procedure” necessary to the successful 
outcome desired. This is because the action precedes the idea. So ritual sexual unions 
accompanied sowing of the earth, and sacrificial rituals and their like abounded among 
miners, smiths and potters. Nature had to be “shown what to do”; man led, not least, by 
example. The correct procedure could only be brought about by those who had placed 
themselves in the correct state of mind. This idea was taken to its logical conclusion 
during the alchemical procedure, which had as its fantastical end state or desired future 
the most profound and far-reaching notion of transformation ever conceptualized: the 
final perfection or “redemption” of matter. 

To induce disparate elements to combine harmoniously in the production of the lapis 
philosophorum —that which will transmute base metals into gold—it was necessary to 
become unified oneself. To engender perfection from nature, therefore, man had to

become perfect. The necessity for the perfection of the alchemist—and the relation of the 
alchemical procedure to his own being—was further strengthened by the alchemist’s 
identity with the material world (that is, by his occupation of the same “categorical 
space” as “matter”). Man—a fallen, corrupt, material being, yet capable of endless 
transformation—partook of the essence of the fallen, corrupt, yet transformable material 
world. Those things relevant to the transformation of the being of “objects” were 
therefore also, by logical necessity, relevant to the transformation of his own being. The 
transformation of base matter into gold, writ large, was the redemption of the world—its 
transformation into the “state of gold.” The lapis philosophorum was means to that end. 
This extension of the theories of sympathetic magic to the domain of “chemistry” meant 
that alchemy became increasingly rife with (primarily imagistic) speculation regarding 
the nature of perfection, as it developed over the centuries. 

It is difficult for moderns to realize why any of this might be relevant. Our psychology 
and psychiatry—our “sciences of the mind”—are devoted, at least in theory, to 
“empirical” evaluation and treatment of mental “disorders.” But this is mostly smoke and 
screen. We are aiming, always, at an ideal. We currently prefer to leave the nature of that 
ideal “implicit,” because that helps us sidestep any number of issues that would 
immediately become of overwhelming difficulty, if they were clearly apprehended. So 
we “define” health as that state consisting of an absence of “diseases” or “disorders” and 
leave it at that—as if the notion of disease or disorder (or of the absence thereof) is not by 
necessity a medieval concatenation of moral philosophy and empirical description. It is 
our implicit theory that a state of “non-anxiety” is possible, however—and desirable— 
that leads us to define dominance by that state as “disordered.” The same might be said 
for depression, for schizophrenia, for personality “disorders,” and so on. Lurking in the 
background is an “implicit” (that is, unconscious) ideal, against which all “insufficient” 
present states are necessarily and detrimentally compared. We do not know how to make 
that ideal explicit, either methodologically or practically (that is, without causing 
immense dissent in the ranks); we know, however, that we must have a concept of “not 
ideal” in order to begin and to justify “necessary” treatment. Sooner or later, however, we 
will have to come to terms with the fact that we are in fact attempting to produce the ideal 
man—and will have to define explicitly what that means. It would be surprising, indeed, 
if the ideal we come to posit bore no relationship to those constructed painstakingly, over 
the course of centuries of effort, in the past. Something very similar happened in the case 
of alchemy, at least in the West: as the philosophy developed, through the Christian era, 
the lapis was increasingly identified with Christ. There is no reason to presume that this 
came as anything but a surprise to the alchemists themselves. We are in for a shock at 
least as great. 

To perfect nature, it was necessary to harbor the correct attitude—to undertake the 
appropriate rituals and processes of spiritual purification; to become pure as the thing 
desired. The worker stood as example to nature, in small things and great. In the case of 
alchemy, which ambitiously desired to “redeem” the fallen material world, the alchemist 
himself had to become great. Thus the alchemical literature might be regarded, in part, as 
one long “meditation” on the nature of the ideal man. 


Episodic Representation in Medieval Christendom 



The Hostile Brothers 427 


Science is predicated upon the axiomatic presupposition that it is worthwhile to analyze 
the material or collectively apprehensible sensory world and its transformations. This 
belief, which first manifested itself in (alchemical) fantasy, is so much a part of the 
modern world, so much its primary assumption, that it is difficult to realize what a 
remarkable achievement its formalization represented. It took thousands of years of 
cultural development to formulate the twin notions that empirical reality existed 
(independent of the motivational significance of things) and that it should be 
systematically studied (and these ideas only emerged, initially, in the complex societies 
of the Orient and Europe). The alchemists were the first to risk this attribution, or 
something similar to it; but they still studied “matter” in the absence of explicit empirical 
methodology. Jung states: 

The concept of the “psychic,” as we understand it today, did not exist in 
the Middle Ages, and even the educated modern man finds it difficult to 
understand what is meant by “reality of the psyche.” So it is not surprising 
that it was incomparably more difficult for medieval man to imagine 
something between “esse in re” and “esse in intellectu solo.” The way out 
lay in “metaphysics.” The alchemist was therefore compelled to formulate 
his quasichemical facts metaphysically too. 606 

The lack of scientific methodology—the inability to conduct formalized comparison of 
behavior-predicated experience, to determine its generalizability—meant the inextricable 
admixture of the purely sensory and the subjective, affective, mythological aspects of 
experience. The purpose of scientific methodology is, in large part, to separate the 
empirical facts from the motivational presumption. In the absence of such methodology, 
the intermingling of the two domains is inevitable: 

[The alchemists]...believed that they were studying the unknown 
phenomenon of matter...and they just observed what came up and 
interpreted that, somehow, but without any specific plan. There would be 
a lump of some strange matter, but as they did not know what it was they 
conjectured something or other, which of course would be unconscious 
projection, but there was no definite intention or tradition. Therefore one 
could say that in alchemy, projections were made [hypotheses were 
generated] most naively and unprogrammatically, and completely 
uncorrected. 

Imagine an old alchemist’s situation. A man in a certain village would 
build an isolated hut and cook things which caused explosions. Quite 
naturally, everyone calls him a witch doctor! One day someone comes and 
says he has found a queer piece of metal and would the alchemist be 
interested in buying it? The alchemist does not know the value of the 
metal, but gives the man some money at a guess. He then puts what has 
been brought him in his stove and mixes it with sulphur, or something 
similar, to see what happens, and if the metal was lead, he would be badly 
poisoned by the vapours. He concludes, therefore, that this particular 
matter makes one feel sick if approached, and nearly kills you, and 



Maps of meaning 428 


therefore he says that there is a demon in lead! Afterwards, when he 
writes his recipes, he adds a footnote saying: “Beware of lead, for in it is a 
demon which will kill people and make them mad,” which would be quite 
an obvious and reasonable explanation for someone of that time and level. 
Therefore lead was a wonderful subject for the projection of destructive 
factors, since in certain connections its effects are poisonous. Acid 
substances were also dangerous, but, on the other hand, being corrosive 
and a means of dissolving things, were highly important for chemical 
operations. Thus if you wished to melt something or have it in liquid form 
it could be melted or dissolved in acid solutions, and for this reason the 
projection was that acid was the dangerous substance which dissolves, but 
which also makes it possible to handle certain substances. Or else it is a 
medium of transformation—you open up, so to speak, a metal with which 
you can do nothing and make it accessible to transformation by the use of 
certain liquids. The alchemists therefore wrote about it in the naive form 
which I am now describing and did not notice that that was not natural 
science but contained a lot of projection, if looked at from a modem 
chemical standpoint. 

Thus there exists in alchemy an astonishing amount of material from 
the unconscious, produced in a situation where the conscious mind did not 
follow a definite program, but only searched. 607 

Alchemy flourished for almost two thousand years, and only faded from view in the late 
eighteenth century. It developed (at least in the Middle Ages) as a movement 
compensating that embodied in absolutist Christianity, which emphasized the ultimate 
reality and value of the spirit, dogmatically concretized; which presumed that everything 
worth knowing had already been discovered, and which cast the material world into 
disrepute. 

For the medieval mind, the body, the sensory, physical world—“matter,” in general— 
was valued as immoral and as corrupt, as ruled by demonic, unknown forces. The story of 
Genesis—serpent and Eve conspiring to bring about the descent of mankind “into the 
profane and fallen (material) world”—in part provided the mythological basis for this 
union of category. The attractions of the material world also posed a threat to 
identification with the church, as the pull of sensuality, for example, or the desire for 
material instead of spiritual wealth. Furthermore, the fact of the fallen material state 
undermined faith in church dogma: apprehension of the unresolved suffering of man 
made it difficult to attribute to Christ’s actions the final state of redemption they 
theoretically guaranteed. In consequence, contact with the “matriarchal underworld of 
matter” (that is, with the “unknown”) seemed very threatening to the church authorities— 
and for very good reason (at least from the perspectives of conservation and tradition). 

Alchemical fascination with “matter” developed antithetically to the early Christian 
valuation of the “spiritual” and the “established” (developed as an antithesis to the 
domain of the known). The suppression of the sensory material world by the church and 
the simultaneous establishment of an absolute body of knowledge meant rejection or 
denial of anomalous sensory/emotional experience, and therefore of the value contained 
in such experience. Alchemical preoccupation with matter arose as a consequence of this 



The Hostile Brothers 429 


lost value asserting itself, in the attraction of the accumulated “rejected and unknown”— 
in the inevitable attraction of the “forbidden fruit.” 

Observing what he did not understand, the alchemist had recourse only to speculation, 
which he used to interpret that unknown. These speculations look like fantasies to the 
modern mind—like the fantasies of the medieval Christian (and pre-Christian, in some 
cases): 


So, in a sense, they are, and for this reason they lend themselves to 
decipherment by the method of complex psychology. [The alchemical 
approach]...is so patently a spiritual and moral attitude that one cannot 
doubt its psychological nature. To our way of thinking, this immediately 
sets up a dividing wall between the psychic and the chemical process. For 
us the two things are incommensurable, but they were not so for the 
medieval mind. It knew nothing of the nature of chemical substances and 
their combination. It saw only enigmatic substances which, united with 
one another, inexplicably brought forth equally mysterious new 
substances. In this profound darkness the alchemist’s fantasy had free play 
and could playfully combine the most inconceivable things. It could act 
without restraint and, in so doing, portray itself without being aware of 
what was happening. 608 

The alchemist thought in a medieval or pre-medieval fashion, using archaic 
preconceptions and ideas. Analysis of that thought, “projected” upon matter (just as we 
interpret “matter” in the light of our own, current and therefore invisible theories), 
therefore means interpretation of fantasy, analysis of the spontaneous productions of the 
exploring mind. Such analysis means increased capacity to understand the workings of 
mind. The entire corpus of alchemy contains seventeen hundred years of fantasy 
regarding the nature of (moral) transformation, assumed to take place in matter (a 
category that included man) “striving” as it did “naturally” toward perfection. Central to 
this movement toward perfection was the dissolution, transformation and reconstitution 
of unredeemed primal matter, the prima materia: 

As is indicated by the very name which he chose for it—the “spagyric” 
art—or by the oft-repeated saying “solve et coagula” [dissolve and 
reconstitute], the alchemist saw the essence of his art in separation and 
analysis on the one hand and synthesis and consolidation on the other. For 
him there was first of all an initial state in which opposite tendencies or 
forces were in conflict; secondly there was the great question of a 
procedure which would be capable of bringing the hostile elements and 
qualities, once they were separated, back to unity again. The initial state, 
named the chaos, was not given from the start, but had to be sought for as 
the prima materia. And just as the beginning of the work was not self- 
evident, so to an even greater degree was its end. There are countless 
speculations on the nature of the endstate, all of them reflected in its 
designations. The commonest are the ideas of its permanence 
(prolongation of life, immortality, uncorruptibility), its androgyny, its 



Maps of meaning 430 


spirituality and corporeality, its human qualities and resemblance to man 
(homunculus), and its divinity. 609 

The alchemists began their work, their opus, by determining to face the unknown, locked 
away in the material world, in the pursuit of an ideal. Their ideal was symbolized by the 
lapis philosophorum, which was a unitary substance characterized by its ability to 
transform base metals into gold, and more—which could confer upon its bearer complete 
knowledge, immortal life, and impeccable mental and physical health. The medieval 
individual had no idea that the creation of such a “substance” was not possible, and was 
aware of many substances that had transformative properties. 

Identification of what motivated such a pursuit appears straightforward. There were 
undoubtedly many who tried their hand at alchemy, purely for its potential economic 
benefit, just as there are many today who pursue their occupation solely for material gain. 
(Even this is a form of desire for redemption, however—through material means—and 
may be unexpectedly transformed into a more purely spiritual pursuit in the course of 
maturation, or through the unpredictable actions of fantasy and circumstance.) There 
were also alchemists who more clearly embodied the spirit of devout curiosity, and who 
worked with the same serious discipline as the later natural scientist. It is naive to 
underestimate the power and the mystery of the fantasy of the philosopher’s stone. This 
idea provided the motive power underlying disciplined investigation into the secrets of 
matter—a difficult, painstaking, expensive procedure. The idea that matter contained 
locked within it the secret to wisdom, health and wealth underlies the entire opus of 
modern science. The fact that such an idea could arise, and be seriously entertained in 
spite of grandiosity and conflict with church dogma, is difficult enough to believe. It 
becomes truly incomprehensible when consideration is given to the additional fact that 
the procedure extended over seventeen centuries, despite the fact that no alchemist every 
reached his goal. Jung states: 

In view of the fact that...a miracle never did occur in the retort, despite 
repeated assertions that someone had actually succeeded in making gold, 
and that neither a panacea nor an elixir has demonstrably prolonged a 
human life beyond its due, and that no homunculus has ever flown out of 
the furnace—in view of this totally negative result we must ask on what 
the enthusiasm and infatuation of the adepts could possibly have been 
based. 

In order to answer this difficult question one must bear in mind that the 
alchemists, guided by their keenness for research, were in fact on a 
hopeful path since the fruit that alchemy bore after centuries of endeavor 
was chemistry and its staggering discoveries. The emotional dynamism of 
alchemy is largely explained by a premonition of these then unheard-of 
possibilities. However barren of useful or even enlightening results its 
labours were, these efforts, notwithstanding their chronic failure, seem to 
have had a psychic effect of a positive nature, something akin to 
satisfaction or even a perceptible increase in wisdom. Otherwise it would 
be impossible to explain why the alchemists did not turn away in disgust 
from their almost invariably futile projects. 610 



The Hostile Brothers 431 


The alchemical fantasy provided (and still provides) the motive power for the empirical 
endeavor, just as the dream of Judeo-Christianity provided motive power for the 
civilization of the West. In this manner, myth, mysterious, absurd and incomprehensible, 
stands at the vanguard of the adaptive process. Eliade states (with specific regard to the 
origin of science): 

Until recently, few were aware of Isaac Newton’s role in this general 
[alchemical] movement, whose goal was the renovatio of European 
religion and culture by means of an audacious synthesis of the occult 
traditions and the natural sciences. It is true that Newton never published 
the results of his alchemical experiments, although he declared that some 
of them were crowned with success. His innumerable alchemical 
manuscripts, ignored until 1940, have recently been meticulously 
analyzed by Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs in her book The Foundations of 
Newton’s Alchemy (1975). Dobbs affirms that Newton experimented in 
his laboratory with the operations described in the immense alchemical 
literature, probing the latter “as it has never been probed before or since” 

(p. 88). With the aid of alchemy, Newton hoped to discover the structure 
of the microuniverse in order to homologize it with his cosmological 
system. The discovery of gravity, the force which keeps the planets in 
their orbits, did not completely satisfy him. But although he pursued the 
experiments indefatigably from 1669 to 1696, he did not succeed in 
identifying the forces which govern the corpuscles. Nevertheless, when he 
began to study the dynamics of orbital movement in 1679-80, he applied 
his “chemical” conceptions of attraction to the universe. 

As McGuire and Rattansi have shown, Newton was convinced that in 
the beginning, “God had imparted the secrets of natural philosophy and of 
true religion to a select few. The knowledge was subsequently lost but 
partially recovered later, at which time it was incorporated in fables and 
mythic formulations where it would remain hidden from the vulgar. In 
modern days it could be more hilly recovered from experience.” 611 For 
this reason, Newton examined the most esoteric sections of the alchemical 
literature, hoping that they would contain the true secrets. It is significant 
that the founder of modern mechanics did not reject the tradition of a 
primordial and secret revelation, just as he did not reject the principle of 
transmutation. As he wrote in his Optics (1704), “the change of Bodies 
into Light and of Light into Bodies is entirely in conformity with the Laws 
of Nature, for Nature seems ravished by Transmutation.” According to 
Dobbs, “Newton’s alchemical thoughts were so securely established that 
he never came to deny their general validity, and in a sense the whole of 
his career after 1675 maybe seen as one long attempt to integrate alchemy 
and the mechanical philosophy” {Foundations, p. 230). 

After the publication of the Principia, opponents declared that 
Newton’s “forces” were in reality “occult qualities.” As Dobbs 
recognizes, in a certain sense these critics were right: “Newton’s forces 
were very much like the hidden sympathies and antipathies found in much 



Maps of meaning 432 


of the occult literature of the Renaissance period. But Newton had given 
forces an ontological status equivalent to that of matter and motion. By so 
doing, and by quantifying the forces, he enabled the mechanical 
philosophies to rise above the level of imaginary impact mechanisms” (p. 

211). In analyzing the Newtonian conception of force, Richard Westfall 
arrives at the conclusion that modern science is the result of the wedding 
of the Hermetic tradition with the mechanical philosophy. 6U 

In its spectacular flight, “modern science” has ignored, or rejected, the 
heritage of Hermeticism. Or to put it differently, the triumph of 
Newtonian mechanics has ended up by annihilating its own scientific 
ideal. In effect, Newton and his contemporaries expected a different type 
of scientific revolution. In prolonging and developing the hopes and 
objectives (the first among these being the redemption of Nature) of the 
neo-alchemist of the Renaissance, minds as different as those of 
Paracelsus, John Dee, Comenius, J.V.Andreae, Fludd, and Newton saw in 
alchemy the model for a no less ambitious enterprise: the perfection of 
man by a new method of knowledge. In their perspective, such a method 
had to integrate into a nonconfessional Christianity the Hermetic tradition 
and the natural sciences of medicine, astronomy, and mechanics. In fact, 
this synthesis constituted a new Christian creation, comparable to the 
brilliant results obtained by the earlier integrations of Platonism, 
Aristotelianism, and Neoplatonism. This type of “knowledge,” dreamed of 
and partially elaborated in the eighteenth century, represents the last 
enterprise of Christian Europe that was undertaken with the aim of 
obtaining a “total knowledge.” 613 

Not precisely the last. 

Formulation of the idea that God might be known in material form meant positing the 
possibility that the highest conceivable value might be embodied concretely in 
“matter”—rather than in the established, patriarchal, “spiritual” world. This meant that 
the “nature of God” was something that could be made subject to material (and 
thoughtful) investigation. However, matter remained comparatively unknown to the 
medieval mind—and was therefore “contaminated” with everything else unknown, 
repressed and rejected. The assignment of value to matter was therefore attribution of 
value to unknown experience. This assignment was heretical, because it implied the 
fallibility or incomplete nature of church dogma (the formalized medieval European 
general model of expectation and desire), and was therefore dangerous, from the 
intrapsychic and the social viewpoints. Such heresy was compounded in severity, because 
the church explicitly regarded matter—representative of the inadmissible unknown—as 
degraded, corrupt, imperfect and demonic. 

The alchemist was an unredeemed, suffering man, in search of an inexpressible ideal. 
He formulated that ideal, and its process of generation, using terms that referred to “the 
physical world,” at least from the modern perspective. However, the alchemist made no 
clear distinction between psychological and objective. His “search for the ideal” was 
therefore as much psychological as chemical (more, actually, since he worked in the 
absence even of the basic measurement devices of modern science). The alchemist 



The Hostile Brothers 433 


posited that the answer lay outside the church, in the unknown. Exploration of the 
unknown and forbidden meant generation of redemptive knowledge (then, as it does 
now). Incorporation of such knowledge meant movement toward perfection. Broadly 
speaking, the alchemist wanted to transform every subordinate element in the category 
“matter” (the unknown, fallen, corrupt world, including man as “material” being) into the 
category “gold” (the Apollinian, spiritual, sunlike, incorruptible state). He was searching 
for a transformative agent to bring about that change (the lapis philosophorum ); but also 
viewed himself as that agent (since he was integrally involved in the transformative opus 
of alchemy). This relatively straightforward conceptualization of “movement toward the 
ideal” is schematically presented in Figure 62: The Alchemical Opus as “Normal 
Story. ” 

The alchemist courageously posited that the work of redemption held up as absolute 
by 



Figure 62: The Alchemical Opus as “Normal Story” 

the church was not yet complete—or at least acted “as if’ there was still work to be done. 
So he hoped to turn what was still unredeemed into gold. The problem is, of course, that 
turning base matter into gold is not possible, as a “normal” act of movement from point 
“a”—the unbearable present—to point “b”—the desirable future. The attempt to produce 
the “most ideal state possible,” however—something akin to paradise on earth—is 
particularly unlikely, without a revolution. So the alchemical “story” rapidly turned into 
something more complex; something that essentially recapitulated the “union of the 





Maps of meaning 434 


gods” (something like a process of initiation or spiritual transformation). The alchemists 
soon came to realize that movement toward the ideal did not mean an unbroken journey 
uphill; soon came to realize that a large leap forward was necessarily preceded by a 
radical descent. 

Once the alchemist had decided to look into the unknown for salvation, rather than to 
the church (or at least in addition to the church), he placed himself outside the protective 
confines of his previous system of classification. Outside that dogmatic system, things 
took on new meaning (or at least new potential meaning). Once you have decided that 
you don’t know absolutely everything about something, it is possible to learn something 
new. However, when an “object” has been placed in a system of classification (within the 
constraints of a particular paradigm), its a priori motivational significance is constrained 
(entirely, in the case of something deemed irrelevant; partially, when the phenomenon is 
assigned a particular use). When the classification system fails [as a consequence of the 
transformation of the environment, natural or social, or, more prosaically, because of the 
emergence of incongruent experience (paradigm-threatening information)] the 
phenomena previously constrained in their motivational significance regain their original 
status. That means that objects of experience are renovelized —that the affect they were 
capable of producing, prior to classification, re-emerges. This process was represented in 
the alchemical scheme by the death of the “king” (the previously reigning “system of 
order”) and the reappearance of the “queen,” the Great Mother (source of threat and 
promise, vital for renewal). The “immersion of the king in the queen” [their “sexual 
union” (the incest motif)] symbolized reduction of the “world” to the precosmogonic 
chaos preceding creation—to the state of prima materia, primal matter. This also led to 
the state of the “warring opposites”—to the re-emergence of conflicting “substances” 
once held in harmony by the preceding orderly condition. The “re-union” (symbolized as 
a creative or “sexual” union) of king and queen produced a state characterized by the 
possibility of something new. This “something new” might be conceptualized as the 
“divine son” emerging from that union, soon to be king again. This divine son was 
regarded, variously, as the new king—or even as the philosopher’s stone itself, in one of 
its many potential forms. This much more complex process of conceptualization—which 
accounts for the vast symbolic production of alchemy—is presented schematically in 
Figure 63: The Alchemical Opus as “Revolutionary Story. ” 


The Prima Materia 

“It offers itself in lowly form. From it there springs our eternal water.” 614 


The prima materia (alternatively: the “round chaos” or the alchemical uroboros) is the 
unknown as matter and, simultaneously, as effect upon imagination and behavior 
(inseparable pre-experimentally): is God as substance and effect of substance. The prima 
materia is the “precosmogonic egg,” the dragon of chaos—the eternal source from which 
spirit and knowledge and matter and world arise. It is the unknown that simultaneously 
generates new phenomena, when explored; the unknown that serves as the source of the 
“information” that comes to constitute the determinate experiencing subject. The 
alchemists therefore granted the prima materia a “half-chemical, half-mythological” 
definition: For one alchemist, it was quicksilver, for others it was ore, iron, gold, lead, 



The Hostile Brothers 435 


salt, sulphur, vinegar, water, air, fire, earth, blood, water of life, lapis, poison, spirit, 
cloud, dew, sky, shadow, sea, mother, moon, serpent.... Jung states: 



Story” 


The autonomy and everlastingness of the prima materia in Paracelsus [for 
example] suggest a principle equal to the Deity, corresponding to a dea 
mater.... The following texts, for example, are applied to the prima 
materia : “and his going forth is from the beginning, from the days of 
eternity” (Micah 5:2) and “before Abraham was made, I am” (John 8:58). 
This is supposed to show that the stone is without beginning and has its 
[primary existence] from all eternity, and that it too is without end and 
will exist in all eternity.... 

And in the same way, continues the author, that the stone together with 
its material has a thousand names and is therefore called “miraculous,” all 
these names can in eminent degree be predicated of God, and the author 
thereupon proceeds to this application. A Christian can hardly believe his 
ears.... “That from which things arise is the invisible and immovable 
God.” 615 



Maps of meaning 436 


The alchemists understood the prima materia to be as of yet “unredeemed,” however, and 
“base.” The notion of corrupted matter was a moral notion, and the “imperfection” of 
matter therefore a moral imperfection. The alchemists’ reflections on the nature of this 
imperfect matter inevitably took the form of reflections upon the moral problem of 
imperfection and material corruption as such. Since the alchemist thought analogically 
and symbolically, in the absence of the empirical method, he fantasized or imagined that 
the corrupt prima materia shared the characteristics of other corrupt and imperfect 
creations, including physical man, contaminated by Original Sin and his own 
transgressions. 

It is virtually impossible for us, as moderns, to realize the degree to which the universe 
of our forebears was a moral universe. Every aspect of that archaic world was engaged in 
moral endeavor, participating in corruption, striving toward perfection. Every ore wanted 
to be pure metal, every pure metal, gold. All smiths, miners and alchemists were 
therefore serving the role of midwife, striving to help the Earth bring forth the “perfect” 
substances it evidently desired to produce. Eliade states, with regard to the attitude 
characterizing the primitive metalworker: 

Mineral substances shared in the sacredness attaching to the Earth- 
Mother. Very early on we are confronted with the notion that ores “grow” 
in the belly of the earth, after the manner of embryos. Metallurgy thus 
takes on the character of obstetrics. Miner and metal-worker intervene in 
the unfolding of subterranean embryology: they accelerate the rhythm of 
the growth of ores, they collaborate in the work of Nature and assist it to 
give birth more rapidly. In a word, man, with his various techniques, 
gradually takes the place of Time: his labours replace the work of Time. 

To collaborate in the work of Nature, to help her to produce at an ever- 
increasing tempo, to change the modalities of matter—here, in our view, 
lies one of the key sources of alchemical ideology. We do not, of couse, 
claim that there is an unbroken continuity between the mental world of the 
alchemist and that of the miner, metal-worker and smith (although, 
indeed, the initiation rites and mysteries of the Chinese smiths form an 
integral part of the traditions later inherited by Chinese Taoism and 
alchemy). But what the smelter, smith and alchemist have in common is 
that all three lay claim to a particular magico-religious experience in their 
relations with matter; this experience is their monopoly, and its secret is 
transmitted through the initiatory rites of their trades. All three work on a 
Matter which they hold to be at once alive and sacred, and in their labours 
they pursue the transformation of matter, its perfection and its 
transmutation. 616 

In the unredeemed prima materia the alchemist understood matter to be trapped in an 
imperfect state; just as man himself was trapped in a corrupt and perishable state by his 
sinful, demonic physical material nature. The transformation of this prima materia into 
gold or into the philosopher’s stone therefore signified a moral transformation, which 
could be brought about through moral means. The alchemists were searching for a 
method to redeem corruption. They applied their fantastical reasoning to redemption of 



The Hostile Brothers 437 


corrupt matter, which seems absurd from the modem viewpoint. However, experience of 
the physical world had been formally damned by the church—for reasons which had their 
own logic—and the lost value this experience represented stood therefore in dire need of 
redemption. The search for lost value led the alchemists deep into consideration of the 
nature of corruption, or limitation, and past that, into its transformation, and redemption. 
Their devoted concentration upon the nature of this problem set in motion fantasies 
associated with the archetype of the way, which always emerges of its own accord, when 
individuals face their limitations and come into contact with the unknown. And it must be 
understood: although the alchemists conflated “the psyche” and “objective reality,” their 
conflation was meaningful. The alchemist did “redeem” himself by studying the 
“redemptive” transformations of matter—most simply, because exploration “releases” 
information that can be used to construct personality; more complexly, because the act of 
voluntary exploration, outside the domain allowed by tradition, constitutes identification 
with the creative hero. 

The first alchemical transformation took the form of disintegration: chemical solution 
or putrefaction of the prima materia, in its “solid” form—in its patriarchal incarnation, 
in its manifestation as “ordered” or “stable” or “rigid” substance. The archetypal first 
stage in any moral transformation (which the alchemist was striving to produce) 
constitutes tragic disruption of the previous state of being. The disintegration of the prima 
materia was analogically equivalent to the degeneration of the alchemist’s previous 
socially determined intrapsychic state, consequential to his decision to pursue the 
unknown: 

The chemical putrefaction is compared to the study of the philosophers, 
because as the philosophers are disposed to knowledge by study, so 
natural things are disposed by putrefaction to solution. To this is 
compared philosophical knowledge. 617 

The nature of the previous state of the alchemist, its symbolic equivalent in the prima 
materia, and the consequences of its disintegration, can be placed in context by 
examination of the medieval worldview. 

The investigation of matter was absolutely heretical, for medieval Homo sapiens. 
Mere suggestion that the unknown still existed, and therefore required investigation, 
threatened the absolute authority of the Christian dogma, as historically formulated by the 
fathers of the church. Questioning this authority meant that the alchemist placed himself 
outside the protection of his cultural canon, in the psychological sense, and at the mercy 
of the ecclesiastical authorities in the practical world. Investigation of matter and its 
transformations was therefore an exceptionally dangerous undertaking, both from the 
intrapsychic and social viewpoints. The standard punishment for heretical undertakings 
was exceedingly horrible—torture and excommunication—and the potential psychic 
consequences scarcely less dangerous. 

The alchemist, in beginning his pursuit, placed himself outside the protective enclave 
of conformity, and risked the investigation of an aspect of experience which, according to 
the worldview of his time, was characterized by absolute demonism. The apprehension 
such an undertaking must have engendered in the minds of those who adopted it is 
scarcely imaginable (although such apprehension re-emerges in the mind of the modern, 



Maps of meaning 438 


threatened by revolutionary ideas). The alchemical search of the unknown, for the ideal, 
had as its prerequisite or its immediate consequence abandonment or disorganization of 
the reigning individual and social worldview. To investigate matter, for the ideal, meant 
to investigate corruption, evil itself, in the pursuit of value. The alchemist who undertook 
this investigation already believed he was in need of redemption, that he was incomplete, 
or he would have never dared step outside the boundaries drawn by the church. His need 
of redemption, of completion, paralleled that of the corrupt prima materia and further 
strengthened the “unconscious” analogous identity between the adept and his material. 


The King of Order 

In the absence of formal empirical methodology, the alchemical adept could only 
investigate the transformations of matter with the preconceptions of his imagination. The 
products of alchemy were therefore necessarily structured according to the myth of the 
way, the primary archetypal manifestation of imaginative fantasy. The alchemist worked 
alone, concentrating on his procedure for months and years at a time, and in this solitary 
pursuit his fantasy had free reign. Once he had the courage to admit to his own ignorance, 
his own insufficiency, his investigations into “matter” took the form of contact with the 
unknown. Admission of personal ignorance presents a challenge to the cultural canon (to 
the degree that the ignorant one is identified with that canon) and sets the stage for moral 
transformation, which manifests itself in symbolic form. The alchemist was searching for 
comprehension of the nature of material corruption and for a method whereby it could be 
perfected. Christian dogma stated that the world had been finally redeemed by the 
Passion of Christ; but it appeared evident to the alchemist that material substances, 
including himself, remained “morally” corrupt and incomplete. Admission of 
imperfection was therefore tantamount to admission that Christian dogma, as presented 
by the authoritarian church—and, in consequence, as represented intrapsychically—was 
incomplete. This incompleteness, manifested as absolute authority, served a tyrannical 
function, which had to be eliminated, prior to the creation of new knowledge. The aspect 
of the prima materia, which was first in need of redemption, was therefore its 
patriarchal/tyrannical aspect, which appeared in imagination as the Great Father—as the 
King, or his symbolic equivalent. Jung states: 

The conscious mind often knows little or nothing about its own 
transformation, and does not want to know anything. The more autocratic 
it is, and the more convinced of the eternal validity of its truths, the more 
it identifies with them. Thus the kingship of Sol, which is a natural 
phenomenon, passes to the human king who personifies the prevailing 
dominant idea and must therefore share its fate. In the phenomenal world 
the Heraclitean law of everlasting change, panto ret, prevails; and it seems 
that all the true things must change and that only that which changes 
remains true... 

In this alchemical procedure we can easily recognize the projection of 
the transformation process: the aging of a psychic dominant is apparent 
from the fact that it expresses the psychic totality in an ever-diminishing 
degree. One can also say that the psyche no longer feels wholly contained 



The Hostile Brothers 439 


in the dominant, whereupon the dominant loses its fascination and no 
longer grips the psyche so completely as before. On the other hand its 
content and meaning are no longer properly understood, or what is 
understood fails to touch the heart. A “sentiment d’incompletude” of this 
kind produces a compensato-ry reaction which attracts other regions of the 
psyche and their contents, so as to fill up the gap. As a rule this is an 
unconscious process that always sets in when the attitude and orientation 
of the conscious mind have proved inadequate. I stress this point because 
the conscious mind is a bad judge of its own situation and often persists in 
the illusion that its attitude is just the right one and is only prevented from 
working because of some external annoyance. If the dreams were 
observed it would soon become clear why the conscious assumptions have 
become unworkable. And if, finally, neurotic symptoms appear, then the 
attitude of consciousness, its ruling idea, is contradicted, and in the 
unconscious there is a stirring up of those archetypes that were the most 
suppressed by the conscious attitude. The therapist then has no other 
course than to confront the ego with its adversary and thus initiate the 
melting and recasting process. The confrontation is expressed, in the 
alchemical myth of the king, as the collision of the masculine, spiritual 
father ruled over by king Sol with the feminine, chthonic mother-world 
symbolized by the aquapermanens or by the chaos. 618 

The process represented symbolically as “disintegration of the king” 
found its analogical material equivalent in the chemical process of 
dissolution—in the immersion of a solid substance or compound (the 
prima materia ) in a solvent, or in its decay, its return to earth (hence the 
still extant metaphor for the wastrel: the dissolute personality). The “solid 
substance,” the king, represented the mythic core of the historically 
determined hierarchy of behavioral pattern and representation with which 
the adept had been previously identified and which had to be abandoned 
or challenged, before the investigation of matter/unknown could begin in 
earnest. Destruction of the culturally determined patriarchal system is 
typically represented in fantasy, symbolically, as the death of the old 
(sterile, sick) king, which becomes necessary when the land is no longer 
fruitful. Such a sacrifice—which was once a ritual—means rejection of 
reliance on a particular pattern of behavioral adaptation and 
representational presumption; means potential for reintroduction of new 
ideas (or even a new pattern of ideas), when adaptation is threatened by 
anomaly. 619 The idea of the king—the central representative of culture— 
was expressed in a multitude of symbolic images during the centuries 
alchemy flourished. The eagle, the sun, the lion, heaven, fire, height, and 
spirit all symbolized different aspects of the patriarchal system, which 
served to represent the initial condition of the prima materia, prior to its 
dissolution. Such symbolic representations emerge as a matter of course, 
if the conditions which originally elicited them re-emerge. Encounter with 
the unknown constitutes one such condition.

The Queen of Chaos 

The solvent in which the prima materia as king dissolves, or the earth to which it returns, 
is imaginatively represented in the alchemical process by symbols characteristic of the 
matriarchal system. The prima materia dissolves in water, salt water, tears, or blood, as 
the old king dissolves in the matriarchal system—dissolves in (previously confined) 
sensuality, affect and imagination, which threaten and transcend knowledge in its 
concrete form, and serve simultaneously as the matrix from which it is borne. The 
matriarchal system is the intrapsychic representative of the queen, the Great and Terrible 
Mother, who is sea, toad, fish or dragon, lioness, earth, depth, the cross, death and matter: 

It is the moon, the mother of all things, the vessel, it consists of opposites, 
has a thousand names, is an old woman and a whore, as Mater Alchimia it 
is wisdom and teaches wisdom, it contains the elixir of life in potentia and 
is the mother of the Savior and of the filius Macrocosma, it is the earth 
and the serpent hidden in the earth, the blackness and the dew and the 
miraculous water which brings together all that is divided. 620 

The prima materia as king dissolves in the prima materia as salt water, or as sea, which 
represent the matrix and emotion, as bitter salt water constitutes tears and tragic affect 
(the consequence of desire’s failure). The heat which promotes chemical solution is the 
symbolic equivalent of passion, emotion or sensuality—aspects of the intrapsychic world, 
outside the domain of rational thought. The dissolution of the king in the matriarchal 
system thematically recreates the heroic/sacrificial motif of incest, creative (sexual) re¬ 
union with the mother. This creative reunion manifests itself first of all as psychological 
chaos, depression and anxiety, and only then as re-creation. The king is the son of God, in 
previously incarnated form, who loses his effectiveness in the course of time. Ritualistic 
primitive regicide is predicated upon the belief that the magic power of the king, his 
ability to renew his subjects and the land, decreases with age. Subjection to (intrapsychic 
and/or social) tyranny inevitably promotes stagnation and depression, dissolution. 
Nonetheless, challenge presented to the prevailing spirit of the times means the removal 
of knowledge from the context within which it has relevance, and the subsequent return 
of what is conditionally known to the domain of the terrible and promising unknown: 

In order to enter into God’s Kingdom the king must transform himself 
into the prima materia in the body of his mother, and return to the dark 
initial state which the alchemists called the “chaos.” In this massa confusa 
the elements are in conflict and repel one another; all connections are 
dissolved. Dissolution is the prerequisite for redemption. The celebrant of 
the mysteries had to suffer a figurative death in order to attain 
transformation. 621 

The matriarchal “realm,” which Jung personified in imagistic representation as the 
anima, is the source of new knowledge, as the unknown. This makes the matriarchal 
realm “mother/wisdom,” matrix of the revelation that renews. Such revelation necessarily 
threatens the stability of previous knowledge, however, and “releases” previously 



The Hostile Brothers 441 


“inhibited” affect (in consequence of the dissolution of predictability and certainty). Jung 
states: 


The anima becomes creative when the king renews himself in her. 
Psychologically the king stands first of all for Sol, whom we have 
interpreted as consciousness. But over and above that he represents a 
dominant of consciousness, such as a generally accepted principle or a 
collective conviction or a tradition. These systems and ruling ideas “age” 
and thereby forcibly bring about a “metamorphosis of the gods.”... [This] 
seldom occurs as a definite collective phenomenon. Mostly it is a change 
in the individual which may, under certain conditions, affect society 
“when the time is fulfilled.” In the individual it only means that the ruling 
idea is in need of renewal and alteration if it is to deal adequately with the 
changed outer or inner conditions. 622 

The king’s original state of sickness is the certain eventual fate of concrete knowledge, 
posited as absolute. Since the unknown always transcends the limits of the known, no 
final statement about the nature of existence is possible. Attempts to limit knowledge to 
what is presently known must therefore necessarily result in eventual social and 
psychological stagnation. It is an unfortunate fact that attempts to overcome such 
stagnation must first result in the production of affective, motivational and ideational 
chaos. Dissolution of the patriarchal in the matriarchal system, even in the voluntary 
pursuit of an ideal, culminates in the creation of a psychically chaotic state, symbolized in 
alchemy as the sickbed of the king, as the pregnancy of the queen, or as some analogical 
equivalent thereof. The chaotic state engendered consequent to decision to pursue the 
unknown is accompanied by emergence of various constitutive psychological factors in 
fantasy, embodied, personified, as opposing forces, lacking mediating principle. This is 
precisely equivalent to an “internal” return to a state of polytheism, where the “gods who 
rule humanity” war without subjection to a higher-order “power.” The alchemists 
described this stage of their opus as the nigredo, or blackness—a condition we would 
associate with depression, psychological chaos, uncertainty, impulsivity and anxiety. 

Blackness descends when the motivational significance of events and processes, 
previously held in check through adherence to a central, paradigmatically structured set 
of beliefs, implicit and explicit, becomes once again indeterminate and novel. The 
dissolution of their previously held beliefs allowed the fiindamental constituent structures 
of the alchemists’ psyche to become actively personified in fantasy. Elements of 
individual, patriarchal, and matriarchal systems vie in competition, lacking uniting 
principle, abandoned in the pursuit of the unknown. Jung states: 

This [initial] battle is the separatio, divisio, putrefactio, mortificatio, and 
solutio, which all represent the original chaotic state of conflict.. ,. 623 Dorn 
describes this vicious, warlike [state] allegorically as the four-horned 
serpent, which the devil, after his fall from heaven, sought to “infix” in the 
mind of man. Dorn puts the motif of war on a moral plane and thereby 
approximates it to the modern concept of psychic dissociation, which, as 
we know, lies at the root of the psychogenic psychoses and neuroses. In 



Maps of meaning 442 


the ''furnace of the cross” and in the fire, says the “Aquarium sapientum,” 

“man, like the earthly gold, attains to the true black Raven’s head; that is, 
he is utterly disfigured and is held in derision by the world, and this not 
only for forty days and nights, or years, but often for the whole duration 
of his life; so much so that he experiences more heartache in his life than 
comfort and joy, and more sadness than pleasure.... Through this spiritual 
death his soul is entirely freed.” Evidently the nigredo brought about a 
deformation and a psychic suffering which the author compared to the 
plight of the unfortunate Job. Job’s unmerited misfortune, visited upon 
him by God, is the suffering of God’s servant and a prefiguration of 
Christ’s passion. 624 

Identification with the pre-existent cultural canon—or pretence of such identification— 
provides protection against the unknown, and context for knowledge, but promotes 
tyranny. The final cost of this identification is the lie—denial of deviance and the 
unknown. When such identification is abandoned voluntarily or rendered impossible by 
circumstantial change, the affects “held in check” by the integrity of the previous 
classification system are free once again to manifest themselves. The “dissolution of the 
king” means that much of what was previously understood reverts to the unknown. This 
might be regarded as the reversal of the historical process that made of all gods one 
supreme god or, speaking more psychologically, as the war of conflicting drives, desires 
and “subpersonalities” that ensues when an overarching hierarchy of values has 
collapsed. Such a “reversion” places the individual in a state characterized by great 
uncertainty, frustration, depression and turmoil. 


The Peregrination 

The alchemists believed that perfection was characterized by a state of unity, in which all 
“competing opposites” were united. The final stage of the alchemical procedure—the 
conjunction—was therefore preceded first by recognition and identification of all the 
diverse “aspects of the psyche” warring in opposition in the “belly of the uroboric 
dragon”: 

What, then, do the statements of the alchemists concerning their arcanum 
mean, looked at psychologically? In order to answer this question we 
must remember the working hypothesis we have used for the 
interpretation of dreams: the images in dreams and spontaneous fantasies 
are symbols, that is, the best possible formulation for still unknown or 
unconscious facts, which generally compensate the content of 
consciousness or the conscious attitude. If we apply this basic rule to the 
alchemical arcanum, we come to the conclusion that its most conspicuous 
quality, namely, its unity and uniqueness —one is the stone, one the 
medicine, one the vessel, one the procedure, and one the disposition— 
presupposes a dissociated consciousness. For no one who is one himself 
needs oneness as a medicine—nor, we might add, does anyone who is 
unconscious of his dissociation, for a conscious situation of distress is 



The Hostile Brothers 443 


needed in order to activate the archetype of unity. From this we may 
conclude that the more philosophically minded alchemists were people 
who did not feel satisfied with the then prevailing view of the world, that 
is, with the Christian faith, although they were convinced of its truth. In 
this latter respect we find in the classical Latin and Greek literature of 
alchemy no evidences to the contrary, blit rather, so far as Christian 
treatises are concerned, abundant testimony to the firmness of their 
Christian convictions. Since Christianity is expressly a system of 
“salvation,” founded moreover on God’s “plan of redemption,” and God 
is unity par excellence, one must ask oneself why the alchemists still felt a 
disunity in themselves, or not at one with themselves, when their faith, so 
it would appear, gave them every opportunity for unity and unison. (This 
question has lost nothing of its topicality today, on the contrary!) 625 

This global recognition was conceptualized, variously, as a “journey to the four corners 
of the earth”—the peregrination —or as familiarization with every aspect of being, as a 
vast expansion of self-knowledge. The incorporation of all competing states of 
motivation into a single hierarchy of value presupposes recognition of all diverse 
(painful, uncomfortable, difficult to manage) desires, and the “forging” of an agreement 
between them. This can be most accurately viewed as a potentially “redemptive” 
expansion of self-consciousness. It might be said: emergence of the limited self- 
consciousness symbolically represented in myths of the Fall constituted grounds for the 
descent of man. The alchemical philosophers—meditating endlessly on the nature of 
perfection, or the transformative processes necessary for the production of perfection— 
came to “realize” that increased self-consciousness might constitute recompense for 
expulsion from paradise. But identification of all competing desires meant clear-headed 
recognition of the truly tragic situation of man, and of all the “sinful” and mortal 
weaknesses, sins and insufficiencies associated with individual being—and then the 
attempt to come to real terms with that situation, and those limitations. 

If you are a miserable and disorganized fool, producing chaos wherever you go, it is 
tremendously painful to recognize yourself—and to see the enormity of the job ahead of 
you. It is very difficult to replace delusional identification with the persona with clear¬ 
headed apprehension of the real (and insufficient) individual personality. This clearer 
vision or conception is something attained at no small cost (and this says nothing about 
the cost of transforming that conception into action). The “savage, wild animal’’ —the 
“hungry robber, the wolf, lion, and other ravening beasts” 626 served as apt representative 
of the “unredeemed individual,” from the alchemical perspective. Emergence and 
recognition of this animal is necessary precondition to his transformation. This idea is 
represented imagistically in Figure 64: The Wolf as Prima Materia, Devouring the 
Dead King. 61 This “devouring of the dead king” by the now-recognized “beast of the 
underworld” is very much akin to Solzhenitsyn’s discovery of his personal responsibility 
for the Gulag that imprisoned him. For a typical modern, an equal shock might be 
produced by his discovery of identity with the Nazi. The barbarians of Hitler’s state were 
normal men—normal men, like you (and me). This cannot be emphasized strongly 
enough. But the “normal man” does not conceptualize himself as Nazi. This means, 
merely, that his self-concept provides him with illusory security (as a prison protects its 



Maps of meaning 444 


inmates from the outside). But the Nazi actions—that is, the willful torture of innocents, 
and enjoyment of such—is well within the normal man’s range of capacities (and does 
not likely exhaust them). The individual is a terrible force for evil. Recognition of that 
force—real recognition, the kind that comes as a staggering blow—is a precondition for 
any profound improvement in character. By such improvement, I mean the capacity to 
bear the tragedy of existence, to transcend that tragedy—and not to degenerate instead 
into something “unconsciously” desirous of disseminating pain and misery. Jung states: 

It is worth noting that the animal is the symbolic carrier of the self [the 
psychic totality]. This hint in Maier is borne out by modern individuals 
who have no notion of alchemy. It expresses the fact that the structure of 
wholeness was always present but was buried in profound 
unconsciousness, where it can 



Figure 64: The Wolf as Prima Materia, Devouring the 
Dead King 

always be found again if one is willing to risk one’s skin to attain the 
greatest possible range of consciousness through the greatest possible self- 



The Hostile Brothers 445 


knowledge—a “harsh and bitter drink” usually reserved for hell. The 
throne of God seems to be no unworthy reward for such trials. For self- 
knowledge—in the total meaning of the word—is not a one-sided 
intellectual pastime but a journey through the four continents, where one 
is exposed to all the dangers of land, sea, air and lire. Any total act of 
recognition worthy of the name embraces the four—or 360!—aspects of 
existence. Nothing may be “disregarded.” When Ignatius Loyalus 
recommended “imagination through the five senses” to the meditant, and 
told him to imitate Christ “by use of his senses,” what he had in mind was 
the lullest possible “realization” of the object of contemplation. Quite 
apart from the moral or other effects of this kind of meditation, its chief 
effect is the training of consciousness, of the capacity for concentration, 
and of attention and clarity of thought. The corresponding forms of Yoga 
have similar effects. But in contrast to these traditional modes of 
realization, where the meditant projects himself into some prescribed 
form, the self-knowledge alluded to by Maier is a projection into the 
empirical self as it actually is. It is not the “self’ we like to imagine 
ourselves to be after carefully removing all the blemishes, but the 
empirical ego just as it is, with everything that it does and everything that 
happens to it. Everybody would like to be quit of this odious adjunct, 
which is precisely why in the East the ego is explained as illusion and 
why in the West it is offered up in sacrifice to the Christ figure. 

By contrast, the aim of the mystical peregrination is to understand all parts 
of the world, to achieve the greatest possible extension of consciousness, 
as though its guiding principle were the Carpocratic idea that one is 
delivered from no sin which one has not committed. Not a turning away 
from its empirical “so-ness,” but the fullest possible experience of the ego 
as reflected in the “ten thousand things”—that is the goal of the 
peregrination. 628 

The mask each person wears in society is based upon the pretence that the individual is 
identical with his culture (usually, with the “best elements” of that culture). The fool, 
hiding behind the mask, is composed of individual deviance, which is deceitfully 
avoided, lied about, out of fear. This deviant, unlived life contains the worst and the best 
tendencies of the individual, suppressed by cultural opinion because they threaten the 
norm; forced underground by the individual himself, because they threaten personal 
short-term psychological stability (which means group identification and ongoing 
inhibition of fear). In the absence of an integrated hierarchical moral (patriarchal) system, 
competing values and viewpoints tend toward disintegration, as each pursues its own 
end—as greed might make the pursuit of lust difficult, as hunger might render love 
impossible. When a moral system undergoes dissolution and loses its absolute validity— 
its higher moral structure—the values which it held in union revert to incompatability, at 
least from the conscious viewpoint. This war of conflicting values—of which each is in 
itself a necessary “divine force”—engenders confusion, disorientation, and despair. Such 
despair—which can be truly unbearable—might be considered the first pitfall of moral 
transformation. Mere contemplation of the possibility of such a state usually engenders 



Maps of meaning 446 


sufficient discomfort to bring further moral development to a halt. The alchemist, 
however, implicitly adopted a heroic role when he voluntarily determined to pursue the 
unknown, in search of the ideal. His unconscious identification with this eternal image, 
his active incarnation of the mythological role, enabled him to persevere in his quest, in 
the face of grave difficulty. Jung states: 

Only the living presence of the eternal images can lend the human psyche 
a dignity which makes it morally possible for a man to stand by his own 
soul, and be convinced that it is worth his while to persevere with it. Only 
then will he realize that the conflict is in him, that the discord and 
tribulation are his riches, which should not be squandered by attacking 
others; and that, if fate should exact a debt from him in the form of guilt, 
it is a debt to himself. Then he will recognize the worth of his psyche, for 
nobody can owe a debt to a mere nothing. But when he loses his own 
values he becomes a hungry robber, the wolf, lion, and other ravening 
beasts which for the alchemists symbolized the appetites that break loose 
when the black waters of chaos—i.e., the unconsciousness of projection— 
have swallowed up the king. 629 

The unknown is contaminated with the psychoanalytic “unconscious,” so to speak, 
because everything we do not know about ourselves, and everything we have experienced 
and assimilated but not accommodated to, has the same affective status as everything that 
exists merely as potential. All thoughts and impulses we avoid or suppress, because they 
threaten our self-conception or notion of the world—and all fantasies we experience, but 
do not admit to—exist in the same domain as chaos, the mother of all things, and serve to 
undermine our faith in our most vital presumptions. The encounter with the “unknown,” 
therefore, is simultaneously encounter with those aspects of our selves heretofore defined 
as other (despite their indisputable “existence”). This integration means making 
behavioral potentialities previously disregarded available for conscious use; means 
(re)construction of a self-model that accurately represents such potential. 

Experiences which are currently deemed taboo—forbidden, from the perspective of 
the currently extant moral schema—may therefore contain within them seeds of creative 
solution to problems that remain unsolved or may arise in the future. Taboo experience 
may yet constitute “unmined” and redemptive possibility. Tales of the “traveling sage,” 
“wandering magician” or “courageous adventurer” constitute recognition of the utility of 
such potential. From the perspective of such narratives, a totality of experience and action 
is the necessary precondition for the attainment of wisdom. This “total immersion in life” 
is the mystical “peregrination” of the medieval alchemist, in search of the philosopher’s 
stone, or the journey of Buddha through the complete sensory, erotic and philosophical 
realms, prior to his attainment of enlightenment. The ritual of pilgrimage—the “journey 
to the holy city”—constitutes half-ritual, half-dramatic enactment of this idea. The 
pilgrim voluntarily places him- or herself outside the “protective walls” of original 
culture and, through the difficult and demanding (actual) journey to “unknown but holy 
lands,” catalyzes a psychological process of broadening, integration and maturation. It is 
in this manner that a true “quest” inevitably fulfills itself, even though its “final, 
impossible goal” (the Holy Grail, for example) may remain concretely unattained. 



The Hostile Brothers 447 


The necessity for experience as the precondition for wisdom may appear self-evident, 
once due consideration has been applied to the problem (since wisdom is obviously 
“derived” from experience)—but the crux of the matter is that those elements of 
experience that foster denial or avoidance (and therefore remain unencountered or 
unprocessed) always border on the maddening. This is particularly true from the 
psychological, rather than ritual, perspective. The holy pilgrimage in its abstract or 
spiritual version is the journey through “elements” of experience and personal character 
that constitute the subjective world of experience (rather than the shared social and 
natural world). The inner world is divided into familiar and unknown territory, much as 
the outer. The psychological purpose of the rite-of-passage adventure (and the reason for 
the popularity of such journeys, in actuality and in drama) is the development of 
character, in consequence of confrontation with the unknown. A “journey to the place 
that is most feared,” however, can be undertaken spiritually much as concretely. What 
“spiritually” means, however, in such a context, is a “peregrination” through the rejected, 
hated and violently suppressed aspects of personal experience. This is most literally a 
voyage to the land of the enemy—to the heart of darkness. 

When experience calls the absolute validity of a given belief system into question, the 
validity of the definitions of immorality—and of enmity—contained with that system 
also become questionable: 

For one may doubt, first, whether there are any opposites at all, and 
secondly whether these popular valuations and opposite values on which 
the metaphysicians put their seal, are not perhaps merely foreground 
estimates, only provisional perspectives, perhaps even from some nook, 
perhaps from below, frog perspectives, as it were, to borrow an expression 
painters use. For all the value that the true, the truthful, the selfless may 
deserve, it would still be possible that a higher and more fundamental 
value for life might have to be ascribed to deception, selfishness and lust. 

It might even be possible that what constitutes the value of these good and 
revered things is precisely that they are insidiously related, tied to, and 
involved with these wicked, seemingly opposite things—maybe even one 
with them in essence. 630 

Recognition of potential in the transformation of the prima materia meant re-encounter 
with personal experience formerly suppressed by cultural pressure and personal decision. 
Such experience might have included hatred, cruelty, physical passion, greed, cowardice, 
confusion, doubt, flight of imagination, freedom of thought and personal talent. Things 
we avoid or deny are precisely those things that transcend our individual competence, as 
presently construed—the things or situations that define our limitations, and that 
represent inferiority, failure, decomposition, weakness and death. This means that 
everything despised and feared, every object of hatred and contempt, everything 
signifying cowardice, ruthlessness, ignorance—every experience that cries out for 
denial—may yet constitute information necessary for life. Jung states: 


In general, the alchemists strove for a total union of opposites in symbolic 
form, and this they regarded as the indispensable condition for the healing

of all ills. Hence they sought to find ways and means to produce that 
substance in which all opposites were united. 631 

Alchemy speaks of “the union of soul-sparks, to produce the gold.” These sparks— 
scintillae —are “the light in the darkness,” the consciousness associated with poorly 
integrated or even hostile elements of individual personality. 6 ' 2 The germ or seed of unity 
may manifest itself symbolically at any time in the procedure, and comes to dominate 
later if procedure is successful. This center—Jung’s “self’ 6 ”—unites the disparate 
elements (the “compulsion of the stars”) into one, in the course of a circular, cyclical 
journey (in the course of the revolutionary spiral path of the way). This emergent center 
was regarded by the alchemists as the spirit Mercurius (the trickster, who was 
“embedded” in matter), or as the mythical “pelican,” who fed her offspring with her own 
body and blood, and was therefore an allegory both of Christ and the (self-nourishing) 
uroboros. The center was also regarded as the philosophical stone (the solitaire) “rejected 
by the builders,” directly identified with Christ, and as the rock

and the Lapis 

upon which security itself might be founded. This stone, this immovable and 
indestructible center, “incorporated” the patriarchal and matriarchal principles (the king 
and the queen), and was also regarded as the “offspring” of chaos, fertilized by order. The 
emergence of the lapis/Christ/pelican from the domain of the dragon of chaos is 
represented in Figure 65: Dragon of Chaos as “Birthplace” of Christ and the Lapis. 634 

The mythological hero faces the unknown, voluntarily, cuts it up, and makes the world 
out of its pieces; identifies and overcomes evil, and rescues the ancestral father,

languishing in the underworld; unites, consciously, with the virgin mother, and produces 
the divine child; and mediates between opposing and warlike kings. He is, therefore, 
explorer, creator, lover, judge and peacemaker. The hero is also he who has traveled 
everywhere—he who has “mastered strange territory” (even that inhabited by his enemy). 
This “traveling everywhere” and “mastering of strange territory” has a psychological 
significance and a social meaning: the divine hero knows and understands the “ways of 
the enemy” and can use them to advantage. 


The Conjunction 

The process of complete recognition, symbolized or dramatized as the peregrination, sets 
the stage for activation of the final alchemical sequence, which consisted of the 
(hypothetical) union of all now-manifest “things.” Jung outlines the “Arisleus vision,” in 
his text Psychology and Alchemy. This vision contains all the elements of the alchemical 
“theory,” portrayed in episodic/narrative form. Its sequential analysis helps shed dramatic 
light on the nature of the “conjunction”: 

Arisleus (a Byzantine alchemist of the 8th or 9th century) tells of his 
adventures with the Rex Marinus, in whose kingdom nothing prospers and 
nothing is begotten. Moreover, there are no philosophers there. Only like 
mates with like, consequently there is no procreation. The king must seek 
the counsel of the philosophers and mate Thabritius with Beya, his two 
children whom he has hatched in his brain. 635 

Jung comments: 

Thabritius is the masculine, spiritual principle of light and Logos which, 
like the Gnostic Nous, sinks into the embrace of physical nature. 636 

This is an elaboration of an idea presented earlier: 

Nous seems to be identical with the God Anthropos: he appears alongside 
the demiurge and is the adversary of the planetary spheres. He rends the 
circle of the spheres and leans down to earth and water (i.e., is about to 
project himself into the elements). His shadow falls upon the earth, but his 
image is reflected in the water. This kindles the love of the elements, and 
he himself is so charmed with the reflected image of divine beauty that he 
would fain take up his abode within it. But scarcely has he set foot upon 
the earth when Physis locks him in a passionate embrace. 637 

It is important to understand this commentary, as well, to completely appreciate the 
nature of the prima materia. The prima materia —Physis—contains spirit, the masculine 
principle, as well as matter, the feminine (Beya, in this narrative). The prima materia— 
dragon of chaos—serves simultaneously as the source of things, the subject to whom 
things appear, and the representations of the things characteristic of that subject. This is 
not a mere material “source”; it is the absolute unknown itself, in whose embrace spirit 



The Hostile Brothers 451 


“sleeps,” until it is released (in the course of the exploration that transforms the self, as 
well as producing something “real” and new). Jung continues, with an idea that we are 
now familiar with: 

When we are told that the King is.. .inanimate, or that his land is 
unfruitful, it is equivalent to saying that the hidden state is one of latency 
and potentiality. The darkness and depths of the sea [which stand for the 
unknown] symbolize the unconscious state of an invisible content that is 
projected. Inasmuch as such a content belongs to the total personality, and 
is only apparently severed from its context by projection, there is always 
an attraction between conscious mind and projected content. Generally it 
takes the form of a fascination. This, in the alchemical allegory, is 
expressed by the Kings cry for help from the depths of his unconscious, 
dissociated state. The conscious mind should respond to this call: one 
should .. .render service to the King, for this would be not only wisdom, 
but salvation as well. 

Yet this brings with it the necessity of a descent into the dark world of 
the unconscious [“the unknown”].. .the perilous adventure of the night sea 
journey, whose end and aim is the restoration of life, resurrection, and the 
triumph over death. 6 ' 8 

Despite the risk, Arisleus and his imaginary “companions” brave the 
quest into the kingdom of the submerged king. This quest ends terribly, 
with the death of Thabritius. His death echoes that of Osiris, and 
symbolizes the completion of the spirit’s descent into “matter” or the 
unconscious or the unknown (where it then lies “implicit” or 
“unrevealed,” and “calls for rescue,” offering riches to its redeemer). Jung 
continues with the story: 

The death of the King’s son is naturally a delicate and dangerous matter. 

By descending into the unconscious, the conscious mind puts itself in a 
perilous position, for it is apparently extinguishing itself. It is in the 
situation of the primitive hero who is devoured by the dragon.... 

The deliberate and indeed wanton provocation of this state is a 
sacrilege or breach of taboo attended by the severest punishments. 
Accordingly, the King imprisons Arisleus and his companions in a triple 
glass house together with the corpse of the King’s son. The heroes are 
held captive in the underworld at the bottom of the sea, where, exposed to 
every kind of terror, they languish for eighty days in an intense heat. At 
the request of Arisleus, Beya is imprisoned with them. [The Rosarium 
version of the “Visio” interprets the prison as Beya’s womb.] 

Clearly, they have been overpowered by the unconscious [“the 
unknown”] and are helplessly abandoned, which means that they have 
volunteered to die in order to beget a new and fruitful life in that region of 
the psyche which has hitherto lain fallow in darkest unconsciousness, and 
under the shadow of death. 6 ’ 9 



Maps of meaning 452 


The “purpose” of the story, in describing this descent, is demonstration that “only in the 
region of danger (watery abyss, cavern, forest, island, castle, etc.) can one find the 
‘treasure hard to attain’ (jewel, virgin, life-potion, victory over death).” 64 " Jung ends his 
commentary: 

The dread and resistance which every natural human being experiences 
when it comes to delving too deeply into himself is, at bottom, the fear of 
the journey to Hades. If it were only resistance that he felt, it would not be 
so bad. In actual fact, however, the psychic substratum, that dark realm of 
the unknown, exercises a fascinating attraction that threatens to become 
the more overpowering the further he penetrates into it. The psychological 
danger that arises here is the disintegration of personality into its 
functional components, i.e., the separate functions of consciousness, the 
complexes, hereditary units, etc. Disintegration—which may be functional 
or occasionally a real schizophrenia—is the fate which overtakes Gabricus 
(in the Rosarium version): he is dissolved into atoms in the body of 
Beya.... So long as consciousness refrains from acting, the opposites will 
remain dormant in the unconscious. Once they have been activated, the 
regius films —spirit. Logos, Nous—is swallowed up by Physis.... In the 
hero myth this state is known as being swallowed up in the belly of the 
whale or dragon. 

The heat there is usually so intense [a consequence of the war of 
affects; anxiety, anger] that the hero loses his hair, and is reborn as bald as 
a babe.... The philosopher makes the journey to hell as a “redeemer.” 641 

The story continues: 

Earlier on, we left Arisleus and his companions, together with Beya and 
the dead Thabritius, in the triple glass house where they had been 
imprisoned by the Rex Marinus. They suffer from the intense heat, like 
the three whom Nebuchadnezzar cast into the fiery furnace. King 
Nebuchadnezzar had a vision of a fourth, “like the son of God,” as we are 
told in Daniel 3:25. 

This vision is not without bearing on alchemy, since there are 
numerous passages in the literature stating that the stone is trinus et unus. 

It consists of the four elements, with fire representing the spirit concealed 
in matter. This is the fourth, absent and yet present, who always appears 
in the fiery agony of the furnace and symbolizes the divine presence— 
succour and the completion of the work. 

And, in their hour of need, Arisleus and his companions see their 
master Pythagoras in a dream and beg him for help. He sends them his 
disciple Harforetus, the “author of nourishment.” So the work is 
completed and Thabritius comes to life again. We may suppose that 
Harforetus brought them the miraculous food [akin to the host], though 
this only becomes clear through a discovery of Ruska’s, who gave us 
access to the text of the Codex Berolinensis. There, in an introduction that 



The Hostile Brothers 453 


is missing from the printed versions of the “Visio,” we read: “Pythagoras 
says, ‘Ye write and have written down for posterity how this most 
precious tree is planted, and how he that eats of its fruits shall hunger no 


The alchemical opus meant, at one level of analysis, the complete integration of 
“unknown” and “known,” insofar as that could be attained—but more profoundly, 
participation in the process that made “one thing” of unknown and known. This construct 
and act of construction typically had twin “final” aims, insofar as it constituted the 
pursuit of perfection: The first of these aims was union of the feminine, maternal 
background of the “unknown ‘material’ world,” seething with danger, passion and 
sensuality, into harmony with the ordering principle of the spirit. [This was represented 
symbolically as dissolution of the dead king and his subsequent regeneration, after eating 
the miraculous food (which is the beneficial aspect of the unknown, and the hero, 
simultaneously)]. The second final aim was re-introduction of the integrated psychic 
structure to the physical body —the conscious “incarnation” of the now-more-complete 
spirit. So this meant that the union attained by the (re)incorporation of the “material 
unknown” was not complete, if it was still a matter of philosophy or abstract 
conceptualization: the well-integrated spirit also had to be realized in behavior. And this 
was not necessarily yet even the final stage. The alchemist Dorn states: 

We conclude that meditative philosophy consists in the overcoming of the 
body by mental union (unio mentalis). This first union does not as yet 
make the wise man, but only the mental disciple of wisdom. The second 
union of the mind with the body shows forth the wise man, hoping for and 
expecting that blessed third union with the first unity [the unus mundus, 
the latent unity of the world]. May Almighty God grant that all men be 
made such, and may He be one in All. 643 

Dorn’s ideas refer to a conjunction conceptualized as a three-stage process. The first 
stage was “union of the mind” (the “overcoming the body by mental union”). This stage 
refers to the integration of “states of motivation” (drives, emotions) into a single 
hierarchy, dominated by the figure of the exploratory hero. The second stage was 
(re)union of the united mind with the body. This is analogous to the “second stage” of the 
hero’s journey. After the treasure is released, consequential to the battle with the dragon, 
the purely personal aspect of the hero’s journey is completed. After all, he has found the 
“treasure hard to attain.” But the hero must return to the community. This is equivalent to 
Buddha’s determination to retire from the state of Nirvana, until all who were living 
could make their home there; is tantamount to the Buddha’s belief that the redemption of 
the one was impossible, in the presence of the unredeemed many. The reunion of the 
united mind with the body is inculcation of proper attitude in action (and is, therefore, the 
effect of the hero on the world). 

The third stage is particularly difficult to comprehend. Reconsideration of the theme of 
the “tailor who mends” 644 —and who can therefore sew up the hole in the sky, made by 
the dying king—might help with initial comprehension. Things that are wrong must be 
set right. This is a psychological process, even if it undertaken purely as a consequence of 



Maps of meaning 454 


actions conducted “in the outside world.” The union of the united spirit/body with the 
world means recognition of the essential equivalence of all experience, or consideration 
of all aspects of experience as literally equivalent to the self. We presume the existence of 
a final barrier between “subject” and “object,” but a standpoint exists that gives to all 
aspects of individual experience—whether “subjective” or “objective”—equal status, as 
aspects of experience. Redeeming any aspect of that experience, then—whether 
“material” or “psychological”; whether “self’ or “other” is then regarded as the same 
act —as the act whose purpose is establishment of the “kingdom of god” (which is 
simultaneously psychological and social state). “Spiritual work” may therefore be 
regarded as indistinguishable from “work on the external circumstances of existence”: 
redeem yourself, redeem the world. Or, alternatively: the attempt to bring about the 
perfection of the external world may be regarded as equivalent to the attempt to perfect 
oneself. After all, dedication to an ideal necessitates development of self-discipline. This 
is voluntary apprenticeship. The world and the self are not different places; from this 
perspective, “all is experience.” The attempt to redeem either necessarily brings about 
redemption in the other. 

All three of these conjunctions may be represented symbolically by the syzygy, the 
“divine union of opposites,” most generally considered as male and female: 

1. first, “known” (previous knowledge, subsumed under patriarchal/spiritual category) + 
“unknown” (anomaly, subsumed under matriarchal/affective/material/physical 
category) = “united spirit”; 

2. then “united spirit” (in this context, subsumed into the patriarchal/spiritual category) 

+ “body” (subsumed under matriarchal/material category)=“united spirit/body”; 

3. then “united spirit/body” (in this context, subsumed under the patriarchal/spiritual 
category)+“world” (matriarchal/material/category)=“united spirit/body/world.” 

All three of these unions can be considered variants of the “incest motif,” (brother/sister, 
son/mother, king/queen pairings). Stage one, the “mental union,” was construed as 
necessary, valuable, but incomplete: the attainment of an ordered subjective state (stage 
two) was another important step along the way: 

Learn therefore, O Mind, to practise sympathetic love in regard to thine 
own body, by restraining its vain appetites, that it may be apt with thee in 
all things. To this end I shall labour, that it may drink with thee from the 
fountain of strength and, when the two are made one, that ye find peace in 
their union. Draw nigh, O Body, to this fountain, that with thy Mind thou 
mayest drink to satiety and hereafter thirst no more after vanities. O 
wondrous efficacy of this fount, which maketh one of two, and peace 
between enemies! The fount of love can make mind out of spirit and soul, 
but this maketh one man out of mind and body. 645 

The third step, however, was critical: philosophical knowledge and ordered intrapsychic 
structure—even when embodied—was regarded as insufficient. That embodied union 
must be extended to all the world—regarded as “an aspect of experience” and, therefore, 
as equivalent (even identical) to the self. 



The Hostile Brothers 455 


The alchemical procedure was based on the attempt to redeem “matter,” to transform 
it into an ideal. This procedure operated on the assumption that matter was originally 
corrupted—like man, in the story of Genesis. The study of the transformations of 
corruption and limitation activated a mythological sequence in the mind of the alchemist. 
This sequence followed the pattern of the way, upon which all religions have developed. 
Formal Christianity adopted the position that the sacrifice of Christ brought history to a 
close, and that “belief’ in that sacrifice guaranteed redemption. Alchemy rejected that 
position, in its pursuit of what remained unknown. In that (heroic) pursuit the alchemist 
found himself transformed: 

Whereas the Christian belief is that man is freed from sin by the 
redemptory act of Christ, the alchemist was evidently of the opinion that 
the “restitution to the likeness of original and incorrupt nature” had still to 
be accomplished by the art, and this can only mean that Christ’s work of 
redemption was regarded as incomplete. In view of the wickedness which 
the “Prince of this world,” undeterred, goes on perpetrating as liberally as 
before, one cannot withhold all sympathy from such an opinion. For an 
alchemist who professed allegiance to the Ecclesia spiritualis it was 
naturally of supreme importance to make himself an “unspotted vessel” of 
the Paraclete and thus to realize the idea “Christ” on a plane far 
transcending a mere imitation of him. 646 

This “realization of Christ on a plane transcending imitation” is an overwhelming idea. It 
makes of religious “belief’ something far more than belief—something far more 
terrifying, and far more promising. The sequence of the alchemical transformation 
paralleled Christ’s Passion, paralleled the myth of the hero and his redemption. The 
essential message of alchemy is that individual rejection of tyranny, voluntary pursuit of 
the unknown and terrifying—predicated upon faith in the ideal—may engender an 
individual transformation so overwhelming that its equivalent can only be found in the 
most profound of religious myths: 

The Son of the great World who is Theocosmos, i.e., a divine power and 
world (but whom even today, unfortunately, many who teach nature in a 
pagan spirit and many builders of medical science reject in the high 
university schools), is the exemplar of the stone which is Theanthropos, 
i.e., God and man (whom, as Scripture tells us, the builders of the Church 
have also rejected); and from the same, in and from the Great World Book 
of Nature, [there issues] a continuous and everlasting doctrine for the wise 
and their children: indeed, it is a splendid living likeness of our Savior 
Jesus Christ, in and from the Great World which by nature is very similar 
to him (as to miraculous conception, birth, inexpressible powers, virtues, 
and effects); so God our Lord, besides his Son’s Biblical histories, has 
also created a specific image and natural representation for us in the Book 
ofNature. 647 



Maps of meaning 456 


It was in pursuit of the unknown that the alchemist experienced this psychological 
transformation, just as it was originally in contact with the unknown that the 
(monotheistic) patriarchal system developed, in the furthest reaches of history. It is the 
symbolic expression of the action of instinct, which manifests itself in some variant of the 
hero myth, whenever the unknown is pursued, without avoidance, in the attempt to 
improve life. The alchemist experienced what the individual always experiences when he 
determines to face every aspect of his existence (individual and collective) without denial 
or recourse to sterile preconceptions. 

The passion that vibrates in [the alchemical texts] is genuine, but would 
be totally incomprehensible if the lapis were nothing but a chemical 
substance. Nor does it originate in contemplation of Christ’s Passion; it is 
the real experience of a man who has got involved in the compensatory 
contents of the unconscious by investigating the unknown, seriously and 
to the point of self-sacrifice. He could not but see the likeness of his 
projected contents to the dogmatic images [which were in fact likely 
utilized by the instinctual procedure], and he might have been tempted to 
assume that his ideas were nothing else than the familiar religious 
conceptions, which he was using in order to explain the chemical proce¬ 
dure. But the texts show clearly that, on the contrary, a real experience of 
the opus had an increasing tendency to assimilate the dogma or to amplify 
itself with it. 64S 

In Christianity, spirit descends to matter, and the result of the union is the birth of Christ 
(and, unfortunately, the formal realization of his opponent). In alchemy, which 
compensated for the one-sided view of Christianity, matter rises to spirit, with analogous 
result: creation of the lapis or philosophical stone, which bears an unmistakable 
resemblance to Christ, embodied in abstractly material form. This form, the philosopher’s 
stone, the lapis, was composed of the most paradoxical elements: it was base, cheap, 
immature and volatile; perfect, precious, ancient and solid; visible to all yet mysterious; 
costly, dark, hidden and evident, having one name and many names. The lapis was also 
the renewed king, the wise old man, and the child. The wise old man posesses the 
charisma of wisdom, which is the knowledge that transcends the limits of history. The 
child represents the creative spirit, the possibility in man, the Holy Ghost. He is not the 
child of ignorance, but the innocence of maturity. He precedes and antedates history in 
the subjective and collective sense: 

The “child” is all that is abandoned and exposed and at the same time 
divinely powerful; the insignificant, dubious beginning, and the triumphal 
end. The “eternal child” in man is an indescribable experience, an 
incongruity, a handicap, and a divine prerogative; an imponderable that 
determines the ultimate worth or worthlessness of a personality. 649 

This final value, the goal of the pursuit of the alchemists, is discovery and embodiment of 
the meaning of life itself: integrated subjective being actively expressing its nature 
through manipulation of the possibilities inherent in the material/unknown world. This 



The Hostile Brothers 457 


final goal is the production of an integrated intrapsychic condition—identical to that of 
the mythological hero—“acted out” in a world regarded as equivalent to the self. 
Production of this condition—the lapis philosophorum —constitutes the “antidote” for the 
“corruption of the world,” attendant upon the Fall [attendant upon the emergence of 
(partial) self-consciousness]. The lapis is “agent of transformation,” equivalent to the 
mythological redemptive hero—able to to turn “base metals into gold.” It is, as such, 
something more valuable than gold —just as the hero is more valuable than any of his 
concrete productions. The “complete” alchemical opus—with production of the lapis as 
goal—is presented schematically in Figure 66: The Alchemical Opus as Myth of 
Redemption. 

Alchemy was a living myth: the myth of the individual man as redeemer. Organized 
Christianity had “sterilized itself,” so to speak, by insisting on the worship of some 
external truth as the means to salvation. The alchemists (re)discovered the error of this 
presumption, and came to realize that identification with the redeemer was in fact 
necessary, not his worship; that myths of redemption had true power when they were 
incorporated, and acted out, rather than believed, in some abstract sense. This meant: to 
say that Christ was “the greatest man in history”—a combination of the divine and 
mortal—was not sufficient expression of 



Figure 66: The Alchemical Opus as Myth of 
Redemption 

faith. Sufficient expression meant the attempt to live out the myth of the hero, within the 
confines of individual personality—to voluntarily shoulder the cross of existence, to 







Maps of meaning 458 


“unite the opposites” within a single breast, and to serve as active conscious mediator 
between the eternal generative forces of known and unknown. 



CONCLUSION: THE DIVINITY OF INTEREST 


Anomalies manifest themselves on the border between chaos and order, so 
to speak, and have a threatening and promising aspect. The promising 
aspect dominates, when the contact is voluntary, when the exploring agent 
is up-to-date—when the individual has explored all previous anomalies, 
released the “information” they contained, and built a strong personality 
and steady “world” from that information. The threatening aspect 
dominates, when the contact is involuntary, when the exploring agent is 
not up-to-date—when the individual has run away from evidence of his 
previous errors, failed to extract the information lurking behind his 
mistakes, weakened his personality, and destabilized his world. 

The phenomenon of interest—that precursor to exploratory 
behavior—signals the presence of a potentially beneficial anomaly. 
Interest manifests itself where an assimilable but novel 
phenomenon exists: where something new hides in a partially 
comprehensible form. Devout adherence to the dictates of 
interest—assuming a suitably disciplined character—therefore 
ensures stabilization and renewal of personality and world. 

Interest is a spirit beckoning from the unknown, a spirit calling 
from outside the “walls” of society. Pursuit of individual interest 
means hearkening to this spirit’s call, journeying outside the 
protective walls of childhood dependence and adolescent group 
identification, and returning to rejuvenate society. This means that 
pursuit of individual interest—development of true individuality—is 
equivalent to identification with the hero. Such identification renders 
the world bearable, despite its tragedies, and reduces neurotic 
suffering, which destroys faith, to an absolute minimum. 

This is the message that everyone wants to hear. Risk your 
security. Face the unknown. Quit lying to yourself, and do what 
your heart truly tells you to do. You will be better for it, and so will 
the world. 


Introduction 

Where does one not encounter that veiled glance which burdens one with a 
profound sadness, that inward-turned glance of the born failure which betrays 
how such a man speaks to himself—that glance which is a sigh! “If only I were 
someone else,” sighs this glance: “but there is no hope of that. I am who I am: 
how could I ever get free of myself? And yet—I am sick of myself 

It is on such soil, on swampy ground, that every weed, every poisonous plant 
grows, always so small, so hidden, so false, so saccharine. Here the worms of 
vengefulness and rancor swarm; here the air stinks of secrets and concealment; 
here the web of the most malicious of all conspiracies is being spun constant 
ly—the conspiracy of the suffering against the well-constituted and victorious.

here the aspect of the victorious is hated. And what mendaciousness is 
employed to disguise that this hatred is hatred! What a display of grand words 
and postures, what an art of “honest” calumny! These failures: what noble elo 
quence flows from their lips! How much sugary, slimy, humble submissiveness 
swims in their eyes! What do they really want? At least to represent justice, love, 
wisdom, superiority—that is the ambition of the “lowest,” the sick. And how 
skillful such an ambition makes them! Admire above all the forger’s skill with 
which the stamp of virtue, even the ring, the golden-sounding ring of virtue, is 
here counterfeited. They monopolize virtue, these weak, hopelessly sick people, 
there is no doubt of it: “we alone are the good and just,” they say, “we alone are 
homines bonae voluntatis .” They walk among us as embodied reproaches, as 
warnings to us—as if health, well-constitutedness, strength, pride and sense of 
power were in themselves necessarily vicious things for which one must pay 
some day, and pay bitterly: how ready they themselves are at bottom to make 
one pay; how they crave to be hangmen. 650 


I was reading Jeffrey Burton Russell’s Mephistopheles: The Devil in the Modern 
World 651 when I came across his discussion of Dostoyevsky’s The Brothers Karamazov. 
Russell discusses Ivan’s argument for atheism, which is perhaps the most powerful ever 
mounted: 

Ivan’s examples of evil, all taken from the daily newspapers of 1876, are 
unforgettable: the nobleman who orders his hounds to tear the peasant boy 
to pieces in front of his mother; the man who whips his struggling horse 
“on its gentle eyes”; the parents who lock their tiny daughter all night in 
the freezing privy while she knocks on the walls pleading for mercy; the 
Turk who entertains a baby with a shiny pistol before blowing its brains 
out. Ivan knows that such horrors occur daily and can be multiplied 
without end. “I took the case of children,” Ivan explains, “to make my 
case clearer. Of the other tears with which the earth is soaked, I will say 
nothing.” 652 

Russell states: 

The relation of evil to God has in the century of Auschwitz and Hiroshima 
once again become a center of philosophical and theological discussion. 

The problem of evil can be stated simply: God is omnipotent; God is 
perfectly good; such a God would not permit evil to exist; but we observe 
that evil exists; therefore God does not exist. Variations on this theme are 
nearly infinite. The problem is not only abstract and philosophical, of 
course; it is also personal and immediate. Believers tend to forget that 
their God takes away everything that one cares about: possessions, 
comforts, success, profession or craft, knowledge, friends, family and life. 

What kind of God is this? Any decent religion must face this question

squarely, and no answer is credible that cannot be given in the face of 
dying children. 65 ' 

It seems to me that we use the horrors of the world to justify our own inadequacies. We 
make the presumption that human vulnerability is a sufficient cause of human cruelty. 
We blame God, and God’s creation, for twisting and perverting our souls, and claim, all 
the time, to be innocent victims of circumstance. What do you say to a dying child? You 
say, “You can do it; there is something in you that is strong enough to do it.” And you 
don’t use the terrible vulnerability of children as an excuse for the rejection of existence, 
and the perpetration of conscious evil. 

I do not have much experience as a clinical psychologist. Two of my patients, 
however, stay in my mind. The first was a woman, about thirty-five years old. She looked 
fifty. She reminded me of a medieval peasant—of my conception of a medieval peasant. 
She was dirty—clothes, hair, teeth; dirty with the kind of filth that takes months to 
develop. She was unbearably shy; she approached anyone who she thought was superior 
in status to her—which was virtually everyone—hunched over, with her eyes shaded by 
her hands, both hands, as if she could not tolerate the light emanating from her target. 

She had been in behavioral treatment in Montreal, as an outpatient, before, and was in 
fact a sight known to the permanent staff at the clinic. Others had tried to help her 
overcome her unfortunate manner of self-presentation, which made people on the street 
shy away from her; made them regard her as crazy and unpredictable. She could learn to 
stand or sit up, temporarily, with eyes unguarded, but she reverted to her old habits as 
soon as she left the clinic. 

She may have been intellectually impaired, in consequence of some biological fault; it 
was difficult to tell, because her environment was so appalling it may have caused her 
ignorance. She was illiterate, as well. She lived with her mother, whose character I knew 
nothing about, and with an elderly, desperately ill, bed-ridden aunt. Her boyfriend was a 
violent alcoholic schizophrenic who mistreated her psychologically and physically, and 
was always muddling her simple mind with tirades about the devil. She had nothing 
going for her—no beauty, no intelligence, no loving family, no skills, no creative 
employment. Nothing. 

She didn’t come to therapy to resolve her problems, however, nor to unburden her 
soul, nor to describe her mistreatment and victimization at the hands of others. She came 
because she wanted to do something for someone who was worse off than her. The clinic 
where I was interning was associated with a large psychiatric hospital. All of the patients 
that still remained after the shift to community care in the aftermath of the sixties were so 
incapacitated that they could not survive, however poorly, on the streets. My client had 
done some volunteer work, of some limited type, in that hospital, and decided that she 
might befriend a patient—take him or her outside for a walk. I think she got this idea 
because she had a dog, which she walked regularly, and which she liked to take care of. 
All she wanted from me was help arranging this—help finding someone whom she could 
take outside; help finding someone, in the hospital bureaucracy, who would allow this to 
happen. I was not very successful in aiding her, but she didn’t seem to hold that against 
me. 

It is said that one piece of evidence that runs contrary to a theory is sufficient to 
disprove that theory. Of course, people do not think this way, and perhaps should not. In

general, a theory is too useful to give up, easily—too difficult to regenerate—and the 
evidence against should be consistent and believable before it is accepted. But the 
existence of this woman made me think. She was destined for a psychopathological end, 
from the viewpoint of biological and environmental determinism—fated as surely as 
anyone I had even met. And maybe she kicked her dog sometimes and was rude to her 
sick aunt. Maybe. I never saw her vindictive, or unpleasant—even when her simple 
wishes were thwarted. I don’t want to say that she was a saint, because I didn’t know her 
well enough to tell. But the fact was that in her misery and simplicity she remained 
without self-pity and could still see outside of herself. Why wasn’t she corrupted—cruel, 
unbalanced and miserable? She had every reason to be. And yet she wasn’t. 

In her simple way, she had made the proper choices. She remained bloody but 
unbowed. And she seemed to me, rightly or wrongly, to be a symbol of suffering 
humanity, sorely afflicted, yet capable of courage and love: 

Such I created all the Ethereal Powers 

And Spirits, both them who stood and them who failed; 

Not free, what proof could they have given sincere 
Of true allegiance, constant faith, or love, 

Where only what they needs must do appeared, 

Not what they would? What praise could they receive 
What pleasure I, from such obedience paid, 

When Will and Reason (Reason also is Choice), 

Useless and vain, of freedom both despoiled, 

Made passive both, had served Necessity, 

Not me? They, therefore, as to right belonged, 

So were created, nor can justly accuse 
Their Maker, or their making, or their fate, 

As if Predestination overruled 
Their will, disposed by absolute decree 
Or high foreknowledge; they themselves decreed 
Their own revolt, not I: if I foreknew, 

Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault. 

Which had no less proved certain unforeknown. 

So without least impulse or shadow of fate, 

Or aught by me immutably foreseen, 

They trespass, authors to themselves in all. 

Both what they judge and what they choose; for so 
I formed them free, and free they must remain 
Till they enthrall themselves: I else must change 
Their nature, and revoke the high decree 
Unchangeable, eternal, which ordained 
Their freedom; they themselves ordained their fall. 654 

The other patient I wish to describe was a schizophrenic in a small inpatient ward at a 
different hospital. He was about twenty-nine when I met him—a few years older than I 
was at the time—and had been in and out of confinement for seven years. He was, of 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 463 


course, on anti-psychotic medication, and participated in occupational-therapy activities 
on the ward—making coasters and pencil holders and so on—but he could not maintain 
attention for any amount of time, and was not even much good at craft. My supervisor 
asked me to administer an intelligence test to him—the standard WAIS-R 655 (more for the 
sake of my experience than for any possible diagnostic good). I gave my patient some of 
the red-and-white blocks that made up the Block Design Subtest. He was supposed to 
arrange the blocks so they matched a pattern printed on some cards. He picked them up, 
and started to rearrange them on the desk in front of him, while I timed him, stupidly, 
with a stopwatch. The task was impossible for him, even at the simplest of stages. He 
looked constantly distracted and frustrated. I asked, “What’s wrong?” He said, “The 
battle between good and evil in heaven is going on in my head.” 

I stopped the testing at that point. I didn’t know exactly what to make of his comment. 
He was obviously suffering, and the testing seemed to make it worse. What was he 
experi-encing? He wasn’t lying, that was for sure. In the face of such a statement it 
seemed ridiculous to continue. 

I spent some time with him that summer. I had never met someone who was so 
blatantly mentally ill. We talked on the ward, and occasionally I would take him for a 
walk through the hospital grounds. He was the third son of first-generation immigrants. 
His firstborn brother was a lawyer; the other, a physician. His parents were obviously 
ambitious for their children, hardworking and disciplined. He had been a graduate 
student, working toward a degree (in immunology, perhaps—I don’t precisely 
remember). His brothers had set him a daunting example, and he felt pressure to succeed. 
His experimental work had not turned out as he had expected, however, and he 
apparently came to believe that he might not graduate—not, at least, when he had hoped 
to. So he faked his experimental results, and wrote up his thesis anyway. 

He told me that the night he finished writing, he woke up and saw the devil standing 
over him, at the foot of his bed. This event triggered the onset of his mental illness, from 
which he had never recovered. It might be said that the Satanic apparition merely 
accompanied the expression of some pathological stress-induced neural development, 
whose appearance was biologically predetermined, or that the devil was merely 
personification of his culture’s conception of moral evil, manifesting itself in 
imagination, as a consequence of his guilt. Both explanations have their merits. But the 
fact remains that he saw the devil, and that the vision accompanied or even was the event 
that destroyed him. 

He was afraid to tell me much of his fantasy, and it was only after I had paid careful 
attention to him that he opened up. He was not bragging, or trying to impress me. He was 
terrified about what he believed; terrified as a consequence of the fantasies that impressed 
themselves upon him. He told me that he could not leave the hospital, because someone 
was waiting to shoot him—a typical paranoid delusion. Why did someone want to kill 
him? 

Well, he was hospitalized during the Cold War—not at its height, perhaps, but still 
during a time when the threat of purposeful nuclear annihilation seemed more plausible 
than it does now. Many of the people I knew used the existence of this threat to justify, to 
themselves, their failure to participate frilly in life—a life which they thought of, 
romantically, as doomed, and therefore as pointless. But there was some real terror in the 



Maps of meaning 464 


pose, and the thought of the countless missiles pointed here and there around the world 
sapped the energy and faith of everyone, hypocritical or not. 

My schizophrenic patient believed that he was, in fact, the incarnation of the world- 
annihilating force; that he was destined, upon his release from the hospital, to make his 
way south to a nuclear missile silo, on American territory; that he was fated to make the 
decision that would launch the final war. The “people” outside the hospital knew this, and 
that is why they were waiting to shoot him. He did not want to tell me this story, in 
consequence—although he did—because he thought I might then want to kill him too. 

My friends in graduate school thought it ironic that I had contact with a patient of this 
type. My peculiar interest in Jung was well known to them, and it seemed absurdly fitting 
that I would end up talking to someone with delusions of this type. But I didn’t know 
what to do with his ideas. Of course, they were crazy, and they had done in my patient. 
But it still seemed to me that they were true, from the metaphorical viewpoint. 

His story, in totality, linked his individual choice, between good and evil, with the 
cumulative horror then facing the world. His story implied that because he had given in to 
temptation, at a critical juncture, he was in fact responsible for the horror of the potential 
of nuclear war. But how could this be? It seemed insane to me to even consider that the 
act of one powerless individual could be linked in some manner to the outcome of history 
as a whole. 

But I am no longer so sure. I have read much about evil, and its manner of perpetration 
and growth, and I am no longer convinced that each of us is so innocent, so harmless. It is 
of course illogical to presume that one person—one speck of dust, among six billion 
motes—is in any sense responsible for the horrible course of human events. But that 
course in itself is not logical, far from it, and it seems likely that it depends on processes 
that we do not understand. 

The most powerful arguments for the non-existence of God (at least a good God) are 
predicated on the idea that such a Being would not allow for the existence of evil in its 
classical natural (diseases, disasters) or moral (wars, pogroms) forms. Such arguments 
can be taken further even, than atheism—can be used to dispute the justice of the existent 
world itself. Dostoyevsky states, “Perhaps the entire cosmos is not worth a single child’s 
suffering.” How can the universe be constructed such that pain is permitted? How can a 
good God allow for the existence of a suffering world? 

These difficult questions can be addressed, in part, as a consequence of careful 
analysis of evil. First, it seems reasonable to insist upon the value of the natural/moral 
distinction. The “tragic circumstances of life” should not be placed in the same category 
as “willfully undertaken harm.” Tragedy—subjugation to the mortal conditions of 
existence—has an ennobling aspect, at least in potential, and has been constantly 
exploited to that end in great literature and mythology. True evil, by contrast, is anything 
but noble. 

Participation in acts whose sole purpose is expansion of innocent pain and suffering 
destroys character; forthright encounter with tragedy, by contrast, may increase it. This is 
the meaning of the Christian myth of the crucifixion. It is Christ’s full participation in and 
freely chosen acceptance of his fate (which he shares with all mankind) that enables him 
to manifest his full identity with God—and it is that identity which enables him to bear 
his fate, and which strips it of its evil. Conversely—it is the voluntary demeaning of our 
own characters that makes the necessary tragic conditions of existence appear evil. 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 465 


But why is life tragic? Why are we subject to unbearable limitation—to pain, disease, 
and death; to cruelty at the hands of nature and society? Why do terrible things happen to 
everyone? These are, of course, unanswerable questions. But they must be answered, 
somehow, if we are to be able to face our own lives. 

The best I can make of it is this (and this has helped me): Nothing can exist without 
preconditions. Even a game cannot be played without rules—and the rules say what 
cannot be done, as much as what can. Perhaps the world is not possible, as a world, 
without its borders, without its rules. Maybe existence wouldn’t be possible in the 
absence of our painful limitations. 

Think of it this way: If we could have everything we wanted, merely for wishing it; if 
every tool performed every job, if all men were omniscient and immortal—then 
everything would be the same, the same all-powerful thing, God, and creation would not 
exist. It is the difference between things, which is a function of their specific limitations, 
that allows them to exist at all. 

But the fact that things do exist does not mean that they should exist, even if we are 
willing to grant them their necessary limitations. 

Should the world exist? Are the preconditions of experience so terrible that the whole 
game should be called off? (There is never any shortage of people working diligently 
toward this end.) 

It seems to me that we answer this question, implicitly but profoundly, when we lose 
someone we loved, and grieve. We cry not because they existed, but because they are 
lost. This presupposes a judgment rendered, at a very fundamental level. Grief 
presupposes having loved, presupposes the judgment that this person’s specific, bounded 
existence was valuable, was something that should have been (even in its inevitably 
imperfect and vulnerable form). But still the question lingers—why should things, even 
loved things, exist at all, if their necessary limitations cause such suffering? 

Perhaps we could reserve answer to the question of God’s nature, his responsibility for 
the presence of the evil in creation, until we have solved the problem of our own. Perhaps 
we could tolerate the horrors of the world if we left our own characters intact, and 
developed them to the fullest; if we took frill advantage of every gift we have been 
granted. Perhaps the world would not look horrible then. 

I dreamed I was walking up out of a deep valley, along a paved 
two-lane highway. The highway was located in northern Alberta, 
where I grew up, and came out of the only valley for miles around, 
in the endlessly flat prairie. I passed a man, hitchhiking, and could 
see another in the distance. As / approached him I could see that 
he was in the first stages of old age; but he still looked terribly 
strong. Someone passed him in a car, driving the opposite 
direction, and a female voice yelled, “Look out—he has a knife!” 

He was carrying what looked like a wooden-handled kitchen 
knife, well-worn and discolored, but it had a blade at least two and 
a half feet long. Across his shoulder he had strapped a large 
leather sheaf. He was walking along the edge of the highway, 
muttering to himself, and swinging the blade in a jerky and chaotic 
fashion. 



Maps of meaning 466 


He looked like the landlord who lived next door to me when I 
was a graduate student, living in a poor district in Montreal. My 
landlord was a powerful, aging ex-biker—former president of the 
local Hell’s Angels chapter, by his own account—who had spent 
some time in prison as a younger man. He had settled down 
somewhat, typically, as he became more mature, and had brought 
his drinking under control for a long time. His wife committed 
suicide when I lived there, however, and he went back to his wilder 
ways. He often went on binge drinking sprees, and spent all the 
money he earned in the electronics shop he ran out of his small 
apartment. He would drink forty or even fifty beers in a single day, 
and would return home in the evening, blind drunk, howling at his 
little dog, laughing, hissing between his teeth, incoherent, good- 
natured still, but able to become violent at the slightest provocation. 

He took me once to a favourite haunt on his 1200 cc Honda, which 
had the acceleration of a jet plane for short distances—me perched 
precariously on the back of his bike, clinging to him, wearing his 
wife’s helmet, which sat on my head ridiculously, uselessly, at least 
five sizes too small. Drunk, he was almost innocently destructive, 
and ended up in fights constantly, unavoidably —as he would take 
slights from people whose paths he crossed, who were 
insufficiently cautious in their conversation with him. 

I hurried by this figure. He seemed upset that no one would stop 
and pick him up, as if he were unaware of the danger he posed. /As 
I went by, his gaze fell on me, and he started after me—not from 
anger, but from desire for companionship. He was not fast, 
however, and I easily stayed ahead of him on the road. 

The scene shifted. The knife-wielding figure and I were now on 
opposite sides of an immense tree—perhaps a hundred yards in 
diameter—on a spiral staircase emerging from the dark below and 
ascending egually far above. The staircase was made of old, worn 
dark wood. It reminded me of the pews in the church I attended 
with my mother as a child, and where I was eventually married. The 
figure was looking for me, but he was a long way back, and I had 
hidden myself from his view as I ascended the staircase. I 
remember wanting to continue on my original journey, out of the 
valley, onto the fiat surrounding plain, where the walking would be 
easy. The only way to stay away from the knife, however, was to 
continue up the staircase—up the axis mundi. 

It is thus that awareness of death, the grim reaper—the terrible face of God—compels us 
inexorably upwards, toward a consciousness sufficiently heightened to bear the thought 
of death. 

The point of our limitations is not suffering; it is existence itself. We have been 
granted the capacity to voluntarily bear the terrible weight of our mortality. We turn from 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 467 


that capacity and degrade ourselves because we are afraid of responsibility. In this 
manner, the necessarily tragic preconditions of existence are made intolerable. 

It seems to me that it is not the earthquake, the flood or the cancer that makes life 
unbearable, horrible as those events appear. We seem capable of withstanding natural 
disaster, even of responding to that disaster in an honorable and decent manner. It is 
rather the pointless suffering that we inflict upon each other—our evil—that makes life 
appear corrupt beyond acceptability; that undermines our ability to manifest faith in our 
central natures. So why should the capacity for evil exist? 

I have been teaching my six-year old daughter to play the piano. I 
am trying to teach her hard lessons—that is, trying to show her that 
there is really a right way to play the piano, and a wrong way. The 
right way involves paying attention to each phrase, each written 
note, every sound she makes, every finger motion. I taught her 
what rhythm meant, a few weeks ago, in one difficult lesson. And 
what does difficult mean? Well, she will sit at the piano and work so 
hard that she cries—but she won’t stop. And she is really interested 
in learning to play. She spends time in the car listening to music, 
working out the rhythms. She uses the metronome by herself, 
playing songs she likes faster and slower. Yesterday I taught her 
the difference between playing loudly and playing softly. She found 
this challenging, experimenting carefully with each key on our old 
piano (which has many idiosyncracies), trying to determine exactly 
how hard it had to be pressed to emit a whispery tone. 

I woke up the morning after one of her lessons, and caught a 
fragment of the end of a dream revery. This is the idea revealed by 
that revery: it is the fact that differences exist between paths of 
action that makes actions worthwhile. I know that what is believed 
determines the value of things. But I had never taken this argument 
to its logical conclusion. If belief determines value then the 
distance between good and evil gives life its meaning. The more 
worthwhile a path of action (which is to say, the “better” it is—the 
more it is good, rather than evil) the more positive emotional 
valence that path “contains.” This means that things have no 
meaning, because no differential value, for those who do not 
believe in good and evil. 

I have certainly known people in that position (although I did not 
know explicitly that they were in that position because they did not 
know the difference between good and evil). They were unable to 
do anything, because they could not tell the difference between 
one path and another. And it is the case that in the absence of 
differences between one thing and another, life begins to appear a 
“cruel and meaningless joke, ” to use Tolstoy’s phrase. I guess that 
is because the burdens of life do not appear worth sustaining in the 
absence of evidence that striving and work have any real value. 



Maps of meaning 468 


This all means: value is a continuum, a line stretching from 
necessary point “a” to necessary point “b.” “A" and “b are defined 
in relation to one another, as two points define a line. The polarity 
between the two determines the valence of the goal. The more 
polarity (that is, the more tension) between the two points, the more 
worthwhile the enterprise. Good cannot be defined—cannot exist — 
in the absence of evil. Value cannot exist in the absence of polarity. 

So, for the world to be worthwhile (that is, for the choice between 
two things to constitute a real choice) both good and evil have to 
exist. 

But then it would be possible to only choose good, at least in the 
ideal—and then evil would not exist, except in potential. So it 
appears that the world could be valuable (could justify the burden it 
requires to maintain) if evil were only to exist in potential—if 
everyone chose to act properly, that is. This seems to me to be the 
most optimistic thought I have ever encountered. 

But how can we put an end to our errors? What path can we follow to eliminate our 
blindness and stupidity, to bring us closer to the light? Christ said, Be ye therefore 
perfect, as your Father in heaven is perfect. 656 But how? We seem stymied, as always, by 
Pontius Pilate’s ironic query: What is truth? (John 18:38) 

Well, even if we don’t know precisely what the truth is, we can certainly tell, each of 
us, what it isn’t. It isn’t greed, and the desire, above all else, for constant material gain; it 
isn’t denial of experience we know full well to be real, and the infliction of suffering for 
the purpose of suffering. Perhaps it is possible to stop doing those things which we know, 
beyond doubt, to be wrong—to become self-disciplined and honest—and to therefore 
become ever more able to perceive the nature of the positive good. 

The truth seems painfully simple—so simple that it is a miracle, of sorts, that it can 
every be forgotten. Love God, with all thy mind, and all thy acts, and all thy heart. This 
means, serve truth above all else, and treat your fellow man as if he were yourself—not 
with the pity that undermines his self-respect, and not with the justice that elevates you 
above him, but as a divinity, heavily burdened, who could yet see the light. 

It is said that it is more difficult to rule oneself than a city, and this is no metaphor. 
This is truth, as literal as it can be made. It is precisely for this reason that we keep trying 
to rule the city. It is a perversion of pride to cease praying in public and to clean up the 
dust under our feet, instead; it seems too mundane to treat those we actually face with 
respect and dignity, when we could be active, against, in the street. Maybe it is more 
important to strengthen our characters than to repair the world. So much of that 
reparation seems selfish anyway; is selfishness and intellectual pride masquerading as 
love, creating a world polluted with good works that don’t work. 

Who can believe that it is the little choices we make, every day, between good and 
evil, that turn the world to waste and hope to despair? But it is the case. We see our 
immense capacity for evil, constantly realized before us, in great things and in small, but 
can never seem to realize our infinite capacity for good. Who can argue with a 
Solzhenitsyn when he states: “One man who stops lying can bring down a tyranny”? 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 469 


Christ said, the kingdom of heaven is spread out upon the earth, but men do not see 
it. 657 What if it was nothing but our self-deceit, our cowardice, hatred and fear, that 
pollutes our experience and turns the world into hell? This is a hypothesis, at least—as 
good as any other, admirable and capable of generating hope. Why can’t we make the 
experiment, and find out if it is true? 


The Divinity of Interest 

The central ideas of Christianity are rooted in Gnostic philosophy, which, 
in accordance with psychological laws, simply had to grow up at a time 
when the classical religions had become obsolete. It was founded on the 
perception of symbols thrown up by the unconscious individuation 
process which always sets in when the collective dominants of human life 
fall into decay. At such a time there is bound to be a considerable number 
of individuals who are possesed by archetypes of a numinous nature that 
force their way to the surface in order to form new dominants. 

This state of possession shows itself almost without exception in the 
fact that the possessed identify themselves with the archetypal contents of 
their unconscious, and, because they do not realize that the role which is 
being thrust upon them is the effect of new contents still to be understood, 
they exemplify these concretely in their own lives, thus becoming 
prophets and reformers. 

In so far as the archetypal content of the Christian drama was able to 
give satisfying expression to the uneasy and clamorous unconscious of the 
many, the consensus omnium raised this drama to a universally binding 
truth—not of course by an act of judgment, but by the irrational fact of 
possession, which is far more effective. 

Thus Jesus became the tutelary image or amulet against the archetypal 
powers that threatened to possess everyone. The glad tidings announced: 
“It has happened, but it will not happen to you inasmuch as you believe in 
Jesus Christ, the Son of God!” 

Yet it could and it can and it will happen to everyone in whom the 
Christian dominant has decayed. For this reason there have always been 
people who, not satisfied with the dominants of conscious life, set forth— 
under cover and by devious paths, to their destruction or salvation—to 
seek direct experience of the eternal roots and, following the lure of the 
restless unconscious psyche, find themselves in the wilderness where, like 
Jesus, they come up against the son of darkness.... 

Thus an old alchemist—and he a cleric!—prays...“Purge the horrible 
darknesses of our minds, light a light for our senses!” The author of this 
sentence must have been undergoing the experience of the nigredo, the 
first stage of the work, which was felt as melancholia in alchemy and 
corresponds to the encounter with the shadow in psychology. 

When, therefore, modern psychotherapy once more meets with the 
activated archetypes of the collective unconscious, it is merely the 
repetition of a phenomenon that has often been observed in moments of 
great religious crisis, although it can also occur in individuals for whom 



Maps of meaning 470 


the ruling ideas have lost their meaning. An example of this is the 
descensus ad inferos in Faust which, consciously or unconsciously, is an 
opus alchymicum. 

The problem of opposites called up by the shadow plays a great— 
indeed, the decisive—role in alchemy, since it leads in the ultimate phase 
of the work to the union of opposites in the archetypal form of the 
hierosgamos or “chymical wedding.” Here the supreme opposites, male 
and female (as in the Chinese ying and yang), are melted into a unity 
purified of all opposition and therefore incorruptible. 658 


November, 1986 


Dear Dad 

I promised you that one day I would tell you what the book I am trying to write is 
supposed to be about. I haven’t been working on it much in the last month, although in 
some regards it is always on my mind and everything I learn, in my other work, has some 
bearing upon it. Because I have abandoned it, temporarily, I thought perhaps I could tell 
you about it, and that would help me organize my thoughts. 

I don’t completely understand the driving force behind what I have been working on, 
although I understand it better now than I used to, three or four years ago, when it was 
literally driving me crazy. I had been obsessed with the idea of war for three or four 
years prior to that, often dreaming extremely violent dreams, centered around the theme 
of destruction. I believe now that my concern with death on a mass scale was intimately 
tied into my personal life, and that concerns with the meaning of life on a personal level 
(which arise with the contemplation of death) took a general form for me, which had to 
do with the value of humanity, and the purpose of life in general. 

Carl Jung has suggested that all personal problems are relevant to society, because 
we are all so much alike, and that any sufficiently profound solution to a personal 
problem may, if communicated, reduce the likelihood of that problem existing in anyone’s 
experience in the future 659 This is in fact how society and the individual support one 
another. It was in this way that my concern with war, which is the application of death on 
the general level, led me into concepts and ideas concerning the meaning of life on the 
personal level, which I could never have imagined as relevant, or believable, prior to 
learning about them—and which I still believe border on what might normally be 
considered insanity. 

The reasons for war, many believe, are rooted in politics. Since it is groups of men 
that fight, and since groups indulge in politics, this belief seems well-founded and in fact 
contains some truth. It is just as true, however, that it is a good thing to look for 
something you don’t want to find in a place where you know it won’t be—and the modern 
concern with global politics, and the necessity to be involved in a “good cause, ” rather 
than to live responsibly, seems to me to be evidence that the desire not to find often 
overpowers the real search for truth. You see, it is true that people don’t want the truth, 
because the truth destroys what lack offaith erects, and the false comfort it contains. It is 
not possible to live in the world that you wish could be, and in the real world at the same 
time, and it often seems a bad bargain to destroy fantasy for reality. It is desire for lack 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 471 


of responsibility that underlies this evasion, in part—but it is also fear of possibility. At 
least this is how it seems to me. 

Because everyone is a product of their times, and because that applies to me as well, I 
looked for what I wanted to find where it was obvious to everyone it would be—in 
politics, in political science, in the study of group behavior. This took up the years I spent 
involved with the NDP, and in studying political science, until I learned that the 
application of a system of thought, like socialism (or any other ism, for that matter) to a 
problem, and solving that problem, were not the same thing. In the former case, you have 
someone (who is not you) to blame—the rich, the Americans, the white people, the 
government, the system — whatever, as long as it is someone else. 

I came to realize, slowly, that a problem of global proportions existed as a problem 
because everyone on the globe thought and acted to maintain that problem. Now what 
that means is that if the problem has a solution, then what everyone thinks is wrong—and 
that meant, too, that what I thought had to be fundamentally wrong. Now the problem 
with this line of reasoning is simple. It leads inexorably to the following conclusion: the 
more fundamental the problem, the more fundamental the error—in my own viewpoint. 

I came to believe that survival itself, and more, depended upon a solution to the 
problem of war. This made me consider that perhaps everything I believed was wrong. 
This consideration was not particularly pleasant, and was severely complicated by the 
fact that I had also come to realize that, although I definitely believed a variety of things, 
I did not always know what I believed—and when I knew what, I did not know why. 

You see, history itself conditioned everything I believed, even when I did not know it, 
and it was sheer unconscious arrogance that made me posit to begin with that I had half 
a notion of who or what I was, or what the process of history’ had created, and how I was 
affected by that creation. 

It is one thing to be unconscious of the answers, and quite another to be unable to 
even consider the question. 

I had a notion that confronting what terrified me - what turned my dreams against 

me—could help me withstand that terrible thing. This idea—granted me by the grace of 
God—allowed me to believe that I could find what I most wanted (if I could tolerate the 
truth; if I was wiling to follow wherever it led me; if I was wiling to devote my life to 
acting upon what I had discovered, whatever that might be, without reservation — 
knowing somehow that once started, an aborted attempt would destroy at least my self- 
respect, at most my sanity and desire to live). 

I believe now that everyone has this choice in front of them, even when they do not 
know or refuse to admit it; that everyone makes this choice, with every decision and 
action they take. 

I mentioned earlier that history’ conditioned what I think and acted. Pursuit of this 
realization—which is rather self-evident, once realized—has led me to the study of 
history, as a psychological phenomenon. You see, if what I think and am is a product of 
history, that means that history must take form inside me, so to speak, and from inside me 
determine who I am. This is easier to understand if you consider that I carry’ around 
inside me an image of you—composed of memories of how you act, and what you 
expected, and depictions of your behavior. This image has had profound impact on how I 
behaved, as a child — when, even in your absence, I was compelled to follow the rides 
which you followed (and which I learned through imitation, and which you instilled into 



Maps of meaning 472 


me, through praise and punishment). Sometimes that image of you, in me, even takes the 
form of a personality, when I dream about you. 

So it is a straightforward matter to believe, from the psychological point of view, that 
each individual carries around an image of his parents, and that this image governs his 
behavior, at least in part. 

But you see it is the case that the rides that you followed—and which I learned from 
you—were not rides that you yourself created, but rather those that you handed to me just 
as you had been handed them while still a child. 

And it is more than likely true that the majority of what I learned from you was never 
verbalized—that the rules which governed the way you acted (and that I learned while 
watching you) were implicit in your behavior, and are now implicit in mine. It was 
exactly in this manner that I learned language—mostly from watching and listening, 
partly from explicit instruction. And just as it is certainly possible (and most commonly 
so) to speak correctly and yet to be unable to describe the rules of grammar that 
“underlie” the production of language, it is possible to act upon the world and make 
assumptions about its nature without knowing much about the values and beliefs that 
necessarily underlie those actions and assumptions. 

The structure of our language has been created in a historical process, and is in a 
sense an embodiment of that process. The structure of that which governs our actions and 
perceptions has also been created during the course of history, and is the embodiment of 
history. 

The implications of this idea overwhelmed me. I have been attempting to consider 
history itself as a unitary phenomenon—as a single thing, in a sense—in order to 
understand what it is, and how it affects what I think and do. If you realize that history is 
in some sense in your head, and you also realize that you know nothing of the 
significance of history, of its meaning—which is almost certainly true—then you must 
realize that you know nothing of the significance of yourself, and of your own meaning. 

I am writing my book in an attempt to explain the psychological significance of 
history>—to explain the meaning of history. In doing so, I have “discovered” a number of 
interesting things: 

1. All cultures, excepting the Western, do not possess a history’ based on “objective 
events. ” The history of alternative cultures—even those as highly developed as the 
Indian, Chinese, and ancient Greco-Roman—is mythological, which means that it 
describes what an event meant, in psychological terms, instead of how it happened, in 
empirical terms. 

2. All cultures, even those most disparate in nature, develop among broadly predictable 
lines, and have, within their mythological history, certain constant features (just as all 
languages share grammatical structure, given a sufficiently abstract analysis). The 
lines among which culture develops are determined biologically, and the rides which 
govern that development are the consequence of the pyschological expression of 
neurophysiological structures. (This thesis will be the most difficult for me to prove, 
but I have some solid evidence in its favor, and as I study more neuroanatomy and 
neuropsychology’, the evidence becomes clearer). 

3. Mythological renditions of history, like those in the Bible, are just as “true ” as the 
standard Western empirical renditions, just as literally true, but how they are true is 
different. Western historians describe (or think they describe) “what” happened. The 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 473 


traditions of mythology’ and religion describe the significance of what happened (and 

it must be noted that if what happens is without significance, it is irrelevant). 

Anyway—I can’t explain in one letter the full scope of what I am planning to do. In this 
book, I hope to describe a number of historical tendencies, and how they affect individual 
behavior—in the manner I have attempted in this letter. More importantly, perhaps, I 
hope to describe not only what the problem is (in historical terms), but where a possible 
solution might lie, and what that solution conceivably could be—and I hope to describe it 
in a manner that makes its application possible. 

If you’re interested in me telling you more (I can’t always tell if someone is interested) 
then I will, later. I don’t know, Dad, but I think I have discovered something that no one 
else has any idea about, and I’m not sure I can do it justice. Its scope is so broad that I 
can see only parts of it clearly at one time, and it is exceedingly difficult to set down 
comprehensibly in writing. You see, most of the kind of knowledge that I am trying to 
transmit verbally and logically has always been passed down from one person to another 
by means of art and music and religion and tradition, and not by rational explanation, 
and it is like translating from one language to another. It’s not just a different language, 
though—it is an entirely different mode of experience. 

Anyways 

I’m glad that you and Mom are doing well. Thank you for doing my income tax 
returns.

It has been almost twelve years since I first grasped the essence of the paradox that lies at 
the bottom of human motivation for evil: People need their group identification, because 
that identification protects them, literally, from the terrible forces of the unknown. It is 
for this reason that every individual who is not decadent will strive to protect his territory, 
actual and psychological. But the tendency to protect means hatred of the other, and the 
inevitability of war—and we are now too technologically powerful to engage in war. To 
allow victory to the other, however—or even continued existence, on his terms—means 
subjugation, dissolution of protective structure, and exposure to that which is most 
feared. For me, this meant “damned if you do, damned if you don’t”: belief systems 
regulate affect, but conflict between belief systems is inevitable. 

Formulation and understanding of this terrible paradox devastated me. I had always 
been convinced that sufficient understanding of a problem—any problem—would lead to 
its resolution. Flere I was, however, possessed of understanding that seemed not only 
sufficient but complete, caught nonetheless between the devil and the deep blue sea. I 
could not see how there could be any alternative to either having a belief system or to not 
having a belief system—and could see little but the disadvantage of both positions. This 
truly shook my faith. 

I turned, in consequence, to my dreams—acting on a tip from Jung, who had proposed 
that the dream might contain information, when no other source could suffice. But my 
dreams dried up, just when I needed them most, and no information was forthcoming. I 
was in a kind of stasis, at a standstill. This was very painful for me. I had spent several 
years intensely working and thinking—trying to understand individual human motivation 
for the worst possible human actions. I was doing what I truly believed was best, to the 



Maps of meaning 474 


best of my ability, and doing it despite its substantial interference with my personal and 
professional lives. I had decided to devote my life to the problem of evil—to the 
development of a true understanding of evil, in the hopes of finding some means of 
combating it—yet my search had come to a stop, a dead end. This did not seem 
reasonable. I truly believed I deserved better. 

Then, one night, my dreams came back, with a vengeance. I had the following 
nightmare, as terrible and potent as the dreams of destruction that had started my quest 
several years before: 

I dreamed I was living in a two-story house. After a bout of heavy 
drinking, I went to the attic and fell asleep. After I fell asleep, I had the 
following dream—nested within a dream: 

I was trapped in a huge chandelier, which was hanging directly 
beneath the dome of an immense darkened cathedral Hie chandelier hung 
hundreds of feet below its point of connection on the dome, and was still 
so high off the ground that the people below, on the floor, looked like ants. 

These people were in charge of the cathedral, and I could tell that they 
were angry> at me for being where I was. I did not feel guilty, because I 
was not there by choice—I just happened to have arrived there, and I 
wanted to leave. 

I realized I was dreaming, and shook myself “awake, ” as a means of 
removing myself from my uncomfortable position. But when I “awoke, ” / 
still found myself suspended in the same place. I tried to deny this, by 
falling back asleep—reasoning that it was better to be dreaming about 
this circumstance than to actually be trapped in it. However, I could not 
return to my previous unconscious state, and stayed painfully awake. 

Then I found myself on the ground, as a consequence of some process 
whose nature I cannot recall. The people of the cathedral protested my 
presence—but that didn’t really bother me. All I wanted to do was get 
home, where it was familiar, and go back to sleep. 

When I returned home, I went into a small, windowless room—I think it 
was the furnace room—in the middle of the ground floor of my house. 

This room was surrounded by other rooms; it had no contact point with 
the outside. There was a small single bed there, that was actually much 
like my real bed. I crawled into it, and tried to fall asleep, but a strange 
wind descended on me. Under its influence, I started to dissolve. I knew 
beyond a shadow of a doubt that it was going to transport me back to the 
chandelier, in the center of the cathedral. I attempted to fight the wind, 
but found that I was virtually paralyzed, and in some sort of convulsion. I 
tried desperately to yell for help, and actually awakened, at least 
partially. 

The windows behind my bed in my real room were wide open, and a 
wind was blowing through them. I frantically closed them, and then 
turned around. I was awake, but in front of me appeared a huge double 
door, like that on a gothic cathedral, between my bedroom and the 
adjacent room, which were only partially separated. I shook myself, and 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 475 


the apparition disappeared. The terror I was experiencing vanished much 
more slowly. 

I had read much of the Gospels earlier that day—which might account for the initial 
reference to the drinking bout (the imbibing of spirit, so to speak). I formulated an 
interpretation of the dream—an essentially unacceptable formulation—immediately upon 
awakening. I knew that the word “spirit” had been derived from the Greek pneuma — 
which meant wind: the wind, for example, that moved upon the water, in Genesis; the 
wind or breath that God blew into the adamah, the matter, to make man. 

I found myself at the central point of a cathedral, in my dream—and I could not 
escape. A cathedral is “sacred space,” designed to keep the forces of chaos at bay; it has 
the same layout as the cross. The central point of a cathedral is, symbolically, the place 
where Christ was crucified, and the center of the universe, simultaneously. All the forces 
embodied in my dream were conspiring to put me there, awake, despite my best efforts to 
the contrary. I could not, at that time, accept the implications of that dream (could not 
believe the implications), and it has taken me a long time to assimilate its meaning: 

“He that believeth on Me, the works that I do he shall do also, and greater 
works than these shall he do” (John 14:12). 

The quotation from John is taken from the fourteenth chapter, where 
Christ teaches that whoever sees him sees the Father. He is in the Father 
and the Father is in him. The disciples are in him and he in them; 
moreover they will be sent the Holy Ghost as Paraclete and will do works 
that are greater 



Maps of meaning 476 



Figure 67: The Restitution of [Christ] the Mystic 
Apple to the Tree of Knowledge 

than his own. This fourteenth chapter broaches a question that was to have 
great repercussions for the future: the problem of the Holy Ghost who will 
remain when Christ has gone, and who intensities the interpenetration of 


Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 477 


the divine and the human to such a degree that we can properly speak of a 
“Christification” of the disciples.... 

It is easy to see what happens when the logical conclusion is drawn from 
the fourteenth chapter of John: the opus Christi is transferred to the 
individual. He then becomes the bearer of the mystery, and this 
development was unconsciously prefigured and anticipated in alchemy, 
which showed clear signs of becoming a religion of the Holy Ghost and of 
the Sapientia Dei. 660 

Myths of the origin commonly portray the condition of paradise as the source of all 
things. The paradisal initial condition, disrupted by the events of the Fall, also serves as 
the goal toward which history proceeds. Stories of the Fall describe the introduction of 
uncontrollable anxiety into human experience, as the consequence of traumatically 
heightened consciousness (as the result of irrevocably attained knowledge of human 
vulnerability and mortality). Re-establishment of paradise, in the aftermath of such 
attainment, becomes dependent upon manifestation of an exemplary way of behaving, 
directed toward a meaningful end—becomes dependent upon establishment of a 
particular mode of redemption: 

An old English legend reports what Seth saw in the Garden of Eden. In 
the midst of paradise there rose a shining fountain, from which four 
streams flowed, watering the whole world. Over the fountain stood a great 
tree with many branches and twigs, but it looked like an old tree, for it had 
no bark and no leaves. Seth knew that this was the tree of whose fruit his 
parents had eaten, for which reason it now stood bare. Looking more 
closely, Seth saw that a naked snake without a skin had coiled itself round 
the tree. It was the serpent by whom Eve had been persuaded to eat of the 
forbidden fruit. When Seth took a second look at paradise he saw that the 
tree had undergone a great change. It was now covered with bark and 
leaves, and in its crown lay a little new-born babe wrapped in swaddling 
clothes, that wailed because of Adam’s sin. This was Christ, the second 
Adam. He is found in the top of the tree that grows out of Adam’s body in 
representations of Christ’s genealogy. 661 

The tree, the axis mundi, is without bark and leaves because has been mortally affected, 
as a consequence of the fall. Production of its first fruit—self-reference—placed it in 
shock, exhausted its resources. Its second fruit, associated with re-emergence into lush 
life and health, is the savior, the hero who redeems mankind from the consequences of 
the Fall, 662 the divine individual whose path of being leads back to paradise. 663 This 
notion is represented imagistically (it has never really proceeded much past the image) in 
Figure 67: The Restitution of [Christ] the Mystic Apple to the Tree of Knowledge. 664 A 
similar pattern of redemptive ideation informs the East. For Gautama, suffering and 
disenchantment are the (necessary) preconditions of adult enlightenment (the name of the 
Buddha—Siddhartha—literally means “goal attained” 663 ). The “enlightened one,” whose 
mode of being in the world transcends the suffering in that world, is an eternal spirit (that 



Maps of meaning 478 


is, an eternally recurrent spirit), despite “historical” incarnation in the figure of the 
Buddha. Figure 68: The Eternal 



Figure 68: The Eternal Return of the Boddhisatva 





Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 479 


Return of the Boddhisatva 666 portrays this spirit, forever dominant over the mass of 
mankind and the Great and Terrible Mother. The boddhisatva, the central “character” in 
this figure, is an Oriental Christ-equivalent (or, perhaps, an image of the paraclete or 
Holy Ghost). The creator of this work has superimposed the bodhisattva on a “tunnel” in 
the sky, ringed by transformative lire. This tunnel adds a temporal dimension to the 
spatial dimensions represented in the image, and allows for the portrayal of the constant 
recurrence, throughout time, of the heroic spirit. This is a reflection of the same idea that 
drove Christian thinkers to attribute prehistorical (and eternal) reality to Christ, despite 
his “historical” nature; as well, that drove speculation about the “spirit of truth” Christ 
left behind, after his death. 

Myths of the fall and redemption portray the emergence of human dissatisfaction with 
present conditions—no matter how comfortable—and the tendency or desire for 
movement toward “a better future.” Such myths describe, in narrative format, how human 
beings think and will always think—regardless of time or place. The most profound of 
such cyclical myths portray heightening of consciousness as cause for emergent unrest. 
Simultaneously, such myths portray qualitatively transformed consciousness as cure for 
that unrest (more profoundly, portray participation in the act of qualitative 
transformation of consciousness as cure for that unrest). 

Proclivity to posit an ideal, implicitly or explicitly, to work toward its attainment, to 
become dissatisfied with its establishment, as new “matter” makes itself manifest, and to 
thereby re-enter the cycle—this constitutes the centrally defining pattern of human 
abstraction and behavior. The simplest and most basic day-to-day human activities, 
invariably goal-directed, are necessarily predicated upon conscious or tradition-bound 
acceptance of a value hierarchy, defining the desired future in positive contrast to the 
insufficient present. To live, from the human perspective, is to act in light of what is 
valued, what is desired, what should be—and to maintain sufficient ignorance, in a sense, 
to allow belief in such value to flourish. Collapse of faith in the value hierarchy—or, 
more dangerously, collapse of faith in the idea of such hierarchies—brings about severe 
depression, intrapsychic chaos and re-emergence of existential anxiety. 

The myth of the Fall describes the development of human self-consciousness as a 
great tragedy, the greatest conceivable anomaly, an event that permanently altered the 
structure of the universe and doomed humanity to suffering and death. But it was this 
same Fall that enabled the individual to adopt the redemptive role of the hero, the creator 
of culture; the same Fall that lifted the curtain on the drama of human history. Whether or 
not it would have been better for humanity to have remained unconscious is no longer a 
point that can be usefully considered—although that path does not seem particularly 
productive for those who take it now. Original Sin has tainted everyone; there is no way 
back. 

For much of human history—after the Fall, so to speak—the individual remained 
firmly ensconced within the confines of a religious dream: a dream that gave meaning to 
the tragedy of existence. Many modern thinkers, including Freud, viewed that dream in 
retrospect as defensive, as a barrier of fantasy erected against the existential anxiety 
generated by knowledge of mortality. However, the dividing line between fantasy and 
reality is not so easily drawn. It is certainly possible to disappear voluntarily into the 
mists of delusion; to withdraw into the comforts of denial from a world terrible beyond 
what can be borne. Imagination is not always insanity, however; its use does not always 



Maps of meaning 480 


imply regression. Imagination and fantasy allow each of us to deal with the unknown, 
which must be met before it is comprehended. Fantasy applied to consideration of the 
unknown is therefore not delusory. It is, instead, the first stage in the process of 
understanding—which eventually results in the evolution of detailed, empirical, 
communicable knowledge. Fantasy can be used to create the real world, as well as the 
world of illusion. It all depends on who is doing the imagining, and to what end. 

When pre-experimental man conceived of the unknown as an ambivalent mother, he 
was not indulging in childish fantasy. He was applying what he knew to what was 
unfamiliar but could not be ignored. Man’s first attempts to describe the unknown cannot 
be faulted because they lacked empirical validity. Man was not originally an empirical 
thinker. This does not mean he was self-deluded, a liar. Likewise, when the individual 
worships the hero, he is not necessarily hiding from reality. It may also be that he is ready 
and willing to face the unknown, as an individual; that he is prepared to adopt the pattern 
of heroic endeavour in his own life, and to further creation in that manner. 

The great myths of Christianity—the great myths of the past, in general—no longer 
speak to the majority of Westerners, who regard themselves as educated. The mythic 
view of history cannot be credited with reality, from the material, empirical point of 
view. It is nonetheless the case that all of Western ethics, including those explicitly 
formalized in Western law, are predicated upon a mythological worldview, which 
specifically attributes divine status to the individual. The modern individual is therefore 
in a unique position: he no longer believes that the principles upon which all his 
behaviors are predicated are valid. This might be considered a second fall, in that the 
destruction of the Western mythological barrier has re-exposed the essential tragedy of 
individual existence to view. 

It is not the pursuit of empirical truth, however, that has wreaked havoc upon the 
Christian worldview. It is contusion of empirical fact with moral truth that has proved of 
great detriment to the latter. This has produced what might be described as a secondary 
gain, which has played an important role in maintaining the confusion. That gain is 
abdication of the absolute personal responsibility imposed in consequence of recognition 
of the divine in man. This responsibility means acceptance of the trials and tribulations 
associated with expression of unique individuality, as well as respect for such expression 
in others. Such acceptance, expression and respect requires courage in the absence of 
certainty, and discipline in the smallest matters. 

Rejection of moral truth allows for rationalization of cowardly, destructive, degenerate 
self-indulgence. This is one of the most potent attractions of such rejection, and 
constitutes primary motivation for the lie. The lie, above all else, threatens the 
individual—and the interpersonal. The lie is predicated upon the presupposition that the 
tragedy of individuality is unbearable—that human experience itself is evil. The 
individual lies because he is afraid—and it is not the lies he tells another that present the 
clearest danger, but the lies he tells himself. The root of social and individual 
psychopathology, the “denial,” the “repression” is the lie. The most dangerous lie of all is 
devoted to denial of individual responsibility—denial of individual divinity. 

The idea of the divine individual took thousands of years to frilly develop, and is still 
constantly threatened by direct attack and insidious counter-movement. It is based upon 
realization that the individual is the locus of experience. All that we can know about 
reality we know through experience. It is therefore simplest to assume that all there is of 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 481 


reality is experience—its being and progressive unfolding. Furthermore, it is the 
subjective aspect of individuality—of experience—that is divine, not the objective. Man 
is an animal, from the objective viewpoint, worthy of no more consideration than the 
opinion and opportunities of the moment dictate. From the mythic viewpoint, however, 
every individual is unique—is a new set of experiences, a new universe; has been granted 
the ability to bring something new into being; is capable of participating in the act of 
creation itself. It is the expression of this capacity for creative action that makes the tragic 
conditions of life tolerable, bearable—remarkable, miraculous. 

The paradise of childhood is absolute meaningful immersion. That immersion is a 
genuine manifestation of subjective interest. Interest accompanies the honest pursuit of 
the unknown, in a direction and at a rate subjectively determined. The unknown, in its 
beneficial guise, is the ground of interest, the source of what matters. Culture, in its 
supportive role, extends the power with which the unknown can be met, by disciplining 
the individual and expanding his range of ability. In childhood, the parent serves as 
cultural surrogate, and the child explores under the umbrella of protection provided by his 
parents. The parental mechanism has its limits, however, and must be superseded by the 
internalization of culture—by the intrapsychic incorporation of belief, security, and goal. 
Adoption of this secondary protective structure dramatically extends and shapes 
individual capability. 

The great dragon of chaos limits the pursuit of individual interest. The struggle with 
the dragon—against the forces that devour will and hope—constitutes the heroic battle in 
the mythological world. Faithful adherence to the reality of personal experience ensures 
contact with the dragon, and it is during such contact that the great force of the individual 
spirit makes itself manifest, if it is allowed to. The hero voluntarily places himself in 
opposition to the dragon. The liar pretends that the great danger does not exist, to his peril 
and to that of others, or abdicates his relationship with his essential interest, and abandons 
all chance at further development. 

Interest is meaning. Meaning is manifestation of the divine individual adaptive path. 
The lie is abandonment of individual interest—hence meaning, hence divinity—for safety 
and security; is sacrifice of the individual to appease the Great Mother and Great Father. 

The lie is fear’s statement, in the face of genuine experience: “That could not really be 
the case; that did not really happen.” The lie weakens the individual—who no longer 
extends the range of his competence by testing his subjectivity against the world—and 
drains his life of meaning. Life without meaning is mortal limitation, subjection to pain 
and suffering without recourse. Life without meaning is tragedy, without hope of 
redemption. 

The abandonment of meaning ensures the adoption of a demonic mode of adaptation, 
because the individual hates pointless pain and frustration and will work toward its 
destruction. This work constitutes revenge against existence, rendered unbearable by 
pride. 

Rebirth is re-establishment of interest, after adoption of culturally determined 
competence. The rebirth of interest moves the individual to the border between the 
known and the unknown and thereby expands the social world. In this manner, God acts 
through the individual, in the modern world, and extends the domain of history. 

Self-consciousness means knowledge of individual vulnerability. The process by 
which this knowledge comes to be can destroy faith in individual worth. This means, in 



Maps of meaning 482 


concrete terms, that an individual may come to sacrifice his own experience, in the course 
of development, because its pursuit creates social conflict or exposes individual 
inadequacy. However, it is only through such conflict that change takes place, and 
weakness must be recognized, before it can be transformed into strength. This means that 
the sacrifice of individuality eliminates any possibility that individual strength can be 
discovered or developed, and that the world itself might progress. 

Individuals whose life is without meaning hate themselves for their weakness and hate 
life for making them weak. This hatred manifests itself in absolute identification with 
destructive power, in its mythological, historical and biological manifestations; manifests 
itself in the desire for the absolute extinction of existence. Such identification leads man 
to poison whatever he touches, to generate unnecessary misery in the face of inevitable 
suffering, to turn his fellows against themselves, to intermingle earth with hell—merely 
to attain vengeance upon God and his creation. 

The human purpose, if such a thing can be considered, is to pursue meaning—to 
extend the domain of light, of consciousness—despite limitation. A meaningful event 
exists on the boundary between order and chaos. The pursuit of meaning exposes the 
individual to the unknown in gradual fashion, allowing him to develop strength and 
adaptive ability in proportion to the seriousness of his pursuit. It is during contact with 
the unknown that human power grows, individually and then historically. Meaning is the 
subjective experience associated with that contact, in sufficient proportion. The great 
religious myths state that continued pursuit of meaning, adopted voluntarily and without 
self-deception, will lead the individual to discover his identity with God. This “revealed 
identity” will make him capable of withstanding the tragedy of life. Abandonment of 
meaning, by contrast, reduces man to his mortal weaknesses. 

Meaning is the most profound manifestation of instinct. Man is a creature attracted by 
the unknown; a creature adapted for its conquest. The subjective sense of meaning is the 
instinct governing rate of contact with the unknown. Too much exposure turns change to 
chaos; too little promotes stagnation and degeneration. The appropriate balance produces 
a powerful individual, confident in the ability to withstand life, ever more able to deal 
with nature and society, ever closer to the heroic ideal. Each individual, constitutionally 
unique, finds meaning in different pursuits, if he has the courage to maintain his 
difference. Manifestation of individual diversity, transformed into knowledge that can be 
transferred socially, changes the face of history itself, and moves each generation of man 
farther into the unknown. 

Social and biological conditions define the boundaries of individual existence. The 
unfailing pursuit of interest provides the subjective means by which these conditions can 
be met, and their boundaries transcended. Meaning is the instinct that makes life possible. 
When it is abandoned, individuality loses its redeeming power. The great lie is that 
meaning does not exist, or that it is not important. When meaning is denied, hatred for 
life and the wish for its destruction inevitably rules: 

If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. 

If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring 
forth will destroy you. 667 



Conclusion: The Divinity of Interest 483 


The wisdom of the group can serve as the force that mediates between the dependency of 
childhood and the responsibility of the adult. Under such circumstances, the past serves 
the present. A society predicated upon belief in the paramount divinity of the individual 
allows personal interest to flourish and to serve as the power that opposes the tyranny of 
culture and the terror of nature. The denial of meaning, by contrast, ensures absolute 
identification with the group—or intrapsychic degeneration and decadence. The denial of 
meaning makes the absolutist or degenerate individual desperate and weak, when the 
great maternal sea of chaos threatens. This desperation and weakness makes him hate 
life, and to work for its devastation—in him, as well as in those around him. The lie is the 
central act in this drama of corruption: 

These are the secret sayings which the living Jesus spoke and which 
Didymos Judas Thomas wrote down. 

And he said, “Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will 
not experience death.” 

Jesus said, “Let him who seeks continue seeking until he finds. When 
he becomes troubled, he will be astonished, and he will rule over the all.” 

Jesus said, “If those who lead you say to you, ‘See, the kingdom is in 
the sky,’ then the birds of the sky will precede you. If they say to you, ‘It 
is in the sea,’ then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is inside 
of you, and it is outside of you. When you come to know yourselves, then 
you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the 
sons of the living father. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell 
in poverty and it is you who are that poverty.” 

Jesus said, “The man old in days will not hesitate to ask a small child 
seven days old about the place of life, and he will live. For many who are 
first will become last, and they will become one and the same.” 

Jesus said, “Recognize what is in your sight, and that which is hidden 
from you will become plain to you. For there is nothing hidden which will 
not become manifest.” 

His disciples questioned him and said to him, “Do you want us to fast? 

How shall we pray? Shall we give alms? What diet shall we observe?” 

Jesus said, “Do not tell lies, and do not do what you hate, for all things 
are plain in the sight of heaven. For nothing hidden will not become 
manifest, and nothing covered will remain without being uncovered.” 668

Although seemingly paradoxical, 
the person who takes upon himself, 
the people’s humiliation, 
is fit to rule; 
and he is fit to lead, 

who takes the country’s disasters upon himself. (Lao-Tzu, 1984c) 

“Sometimes I look at a Socialist—the intellectual, tract-writing type of Socialist, with his 

2. pullover, his fuzzy hair, and his Marxian quotation—and wonder what the devil his motive 
really is. It is often difficult to believe that it is a love of anybody, especially of the working 
class, from whom he is of all people the furthest removed.” (Orwell, G. [1981], pp. 156-157)

5. Ten years later, when I was finishing this manuscript, a student of mine, Heidi Trend, wrote: 

During the journey from Egypt to Canaan the impatient Israelites accused God 
and Moses of leading them into the desert to die. As a consequence of this 
complaining, Yahweh sent venomous serpents among the Israelites. Those 
Israelites who were not bitten by the serpents repented and asked Moses to 
intervene with God. Yahweh instructed Moses to make a bronze [or fiery] 
serpent and to place it on top of a pole so that those who were bitten could 
behold it and live. Moses did as he was commanded and, whenever a snake bit 
someone, that person would look at the bronze statue and live [Numbers 21:5- 
10],... John the Evangelist has Jesus explaining to Nicodemus, “And as Moses 
lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted 
up; That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.” 

[John 3:13-15] 

Treml pointed out that the serpent has been widely regarded both as an agent of death 
(because of its venom) and as an agent of transformation and rebirth (because it could 
shed its skin). This intense ambivalence of feature makes it an apt representative of 
the “numinous” (following Rudolf Otto, whose ideas are described later in this 
manuscript). The numinous is able to invoke trembling and fear (mysterium 
tremendum) and powerful attraction and fascination (mysterium fascinans). Treml 
commented, further: “if a person could sustain the gaze of the serpent—which 
symbolized his greatest fear—lie would be healed.” 

Why was Christ assimilated to the serpent, in my painting and in the New Testament? 
(Understand that I knew nothing whatsoever of this relationship when I originally constructed 
the sketch.) It has something to do with his representation as judge in Revelations: 

I know thy works, that thou art neither cold nor hot: I would thou wert cold or 
hot. 

So then because thou art lukewarm, and neither cold nor hot, I will spue thee 
out of my mouth. 



Notes 486 


Because thou sayest, I am rich, and increased with goods, and have need of 
nothing; and knowest not that thou art wretched, and miserable, and poor, and 
blind, and naked: 

I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire, that thou mayest be rich; and 
white raiment, that thou mayest be clothed, and that the shame of thy 
nakedness do not appear; and anoint thine eyes with eye-salve, that thou 
mayest see. (Revelations 3:15-19) 


The idea of the Savior necessarily implies the Judge—and a judge of the most 
implacable sort—because the Savior is a mythological representation of that which is 
ideal, and the ideal always stands in judgment over the actual. The archetypal image 
of the Savior, who represents perfection or completion, is therefore terrifying in 
precise proportion to personal distance from the ideal.

German equivalent of “meaning” (Wilhelm, R. [1971], p. iv). The way is a path of life, guided 
by processes manifested outside the area circumscribed by defined, logic, internally consistent 
cognitive structures. From such a perspective, meaningful experiences might be considered 
“guideposts” marking the path to a new mode of being. Any form of art that produces an 
aesthetic seizure, or intimation of meaning, might therefore serve as such a guidepost—at least 
in principle (see Solzhenitsyn, A.I. [1990], pp. 623-630).

37. I use the term “promise” here partly because it makes a good (that is, symmetric) 
counterpart to “threat.” The term “promise” used here means “incentive reward” or 
“cue for satisfaction” or “cue for consummatory reward.” Furthermore, neither the 
former term, nor the latter, appear particularly appropriate for the positive state 
induced by contact with novelty. Novelty does not seem reasonably categorized as 
a “reward”; also, positive affect can be generated through contact with novelty, in 
the absence of any conditioning whatsover (Gray, J.A. [1982]), so the term “cue” 
seems inappropriate.

121. Recent work conducted on three related phenomena—latent inhibition, prepulse 
inhibition of startle, and negative priming—illustrates the essential validity of this 
viewpoint. “Latent inhibition” (LI) is the difficulty in learning that “a” signifies 
“b,” when “a” previously signified “c” (where “c” is, most frequently, nothing) 
(see Lubow, R.E. [1989], for a review of the literature; Gray, J.A. & McNaughton, 
N. [1996] and Gray, J.A., Feldon, J., Rawlins, J.N.P., Hemsley, D.R., & Smith, 
A.D. [1991] for a discussion of putative neuropsychology). If you expose a caged 
rat repeatedly to a intermittent light, paired with a shock, he becomes afraid of the 
light, hi classical terms, the light has become a conditioned stimulus for shock, and 
therefore elicits fear. However, if you have pre-exposed the rat to the same light, 
repeatedly, in the absence of any consequence, then he takes substantially longer to 



Notes 490 


learn the new light/shock connection. Latent inhibition (LI) provides an example of 
the difficulty in learning (new valence), consequential to previous learning (an 
alternative is provided by the related Kamin blocking effect [Jones, S.H., Gray, 
J.A., & Hemsley, D.R. (1992)]). The capacity for LI characterizes a variety of 
animal species, as well as man; the phenomena itself can be elicited using a 
number of different experimental paradigms (using differently valenced 
“unconditioned” stimuli). Acute first-onset schizophrenics and their close 
“cousins” (schizotypes)—overwhelmed by their everyday experience—manifest 
decreased LI, as do individuals taking amphetamines or other dopa-minergic 
agonists (which produce heightened exploratory behavior [Wise, R.A. & Bozarth, 
M.A. (1987)]). Antipsychotic medications, which damp down the a priori 
significance of things, normalize this decrease. 

Prepulse inhibition (PPI) of startle occurs when the magnitude of a startle response 
to an intense, unexpected “stimuli” (such as a loud noise) is attenuated as a 
consequence of a “hint” (such as a similar, but less intense noise) given 30-500 
msec earlier. The fact of the hint apparently decreases the relative novelty (the 
unpredictability) of the more intense subsequent stimuli, at least among normal 
individuals; alternatively, it might be regarded as an analog of graduated exposure 
(the procedure by which behavioral therapists “desensitize” the fear responses of 
their clients). Schizophrenics, once again, or persons with related cognitive 
abnormalities (Swerdlow, N.R, Filion, D., Geyer, M.A., & Braff, D.L. [1995]) 
manifest decreased PPI, indicating, perhaps, that they cannot effectively use the 
capacity to predict, on the basis of past experience, to modulate their 
affective/psychophysiological responses to stimuli that “intrinsically demand” 
response (to “unconditioned stimuli,” in the old terminology). 

Individuals participating in the “negative priming” paradigm must learn to respond 
to a stimulus that appears in the same place recently (< 350 msec) occupied by an 
irrelevant or distractor stimulus. Normals are better at defining a place as irrelevant 
than are schizophrenic or schizotypic individuals—hence, their reaction times, 
when “negatively primed,” are longer (Swerdlow, N.R., Filion, D., Geyer, M.A., & 
Braff, D.L. [1995]). The negative priming paradigm, like the others, demonstrates 
that irrelevancy (the cardinal characteristic of the unassociated “conditioned 
stimulus”) must be learned and may be unlearned (sometimes with devastating 
consequences). At issue, therefore, is the a priori status of the conditioned stimulus 
with regard to valence and how that status might be altered or “explored away.” 

The experiments utilizing LI (and related procedures) are fascinating—and 
critically important—because they demonstrate that the irrelevance of most 
context-dependent irrelevant things is not given. Irrelevance must be learned; 
furthermore, such learning is sufficiently powerful to interfere with subsequent 
learning, when motivational contingencies shift. The original curiosity- or hope- 
inducing aspect of now-familiar things appears to be driven by disinhibited 
amygdalic-driven dopaminergic activation in the nucleus accumbens (Gray, J.A., 
Feldon, J., Rawlins, J.N.P., Hemsley, D.R., & Smith, A.D. [1991]) which is the 
same center activated by most, if not all, “positively reinforcing” drugs of abuse 
(Wise, R.A. & Bozarth, M.A. [1987]). The “fear-inducing aspect”—which must 
logically co-exist—has received less attention (although the role of the amygdala 
in producing novelty-driven fear is well-established, as described previously). It is 
these twin aspects—threat and promise, inducing a priori fear and hope (relevance, 
in its most fundamental guise)—that normally lie beyond (Huxley, A. [1956]) 
William Blake’s “doors of perception” and that lend to existence itself its 
“intrinsic” (and sometimes overwhelming) meaning: 



Notes 491 


If the doors of perception were cleansed everything would appear 
to man as it is, infinite. 

For man has closed himself up, till he sees all things thro’ narrow 
chinks of his cavern. 

(Blake, W. [1946], p. 258) 

Physiological or environmental events that open these doors allow us 
insight into the original nature of things; such insight, when involuntary 
(as it appears to be in the case of schizophrenia, for example) is of 
sufficient power to terrify and, perhaps, to destroy. The a priori valence of 
the object is potent, and potentially terrifying (as terrifying, literally, as 
anything imaginable). Our normal circumstances, our prior learning, 
protect us from this valence; they shield us, restrict our access to meaning 
as such. Events that interfere with the stability of that learning or with its 
conditional validity have the capacity to allow meaning to re-emerge, with 
its awful force unshielded.

132. Exploration is not merely specification of the “inherent” properties of the 
unexpected thing or situation. The actual nature of things or situations (from the 
perspective of valence and objective classification) is dependent upon the 
behavioral strategies employed in its presence, and on the ends that are currently 
being pursued. This means that determinate experience must be considered an 
emergent property of behavior to a degree that is presently unspecifiable. This 
appears as true for the purely objective aspects of experience (which constitute the 
subject matter for science) (see Kuhn, T. [1970]; Feyeraband, P.K. [1981]) as for 
the subjective. 

The word itself, as case in point, can no longer reasonably be regarded as a “label” 
for a “thing” (Wittgenstein, L. [1968], pp. 46e-47e). The notion that a concept is a 
label for an object is nothing but a slightly higher-order version of the same error. 
Wittgenstein pointed out, essentially, that our sense of unified “thing” is not simply 
given (Wittgenstein, L. [1968]). We tend to think of the objects we perceive as 
“being there” in some essential sense; but we see the tree before the branches. 
Despite this conceptual phenomenon, the tree has no objective precedence over the 
branches (or the leaves, or the cells that make up the leaves, or the forest, for that 
matter). Roger Brown, following Wittgenstein’s lead, demonstrated that “objects” 
have their “basic levels”—their levels of resolution, essentially, that appear most 
easily and rapidly learned by children, and constant across cultures (Brown, R. 
[1986]). 



Notes 492 


Wittgenstein solved the “words are not labels for objects” problem by positing that 
a word was a tool. A word plays a role in a game and is akin to a chessman in 
chess (Wittgenstein, L. [1968], pp. 46e-47e). “The meaning of a piece is its role in 
the game” (Wittgenstein, L. [1968], p. 150e). He noted, furthermore, that the 
“game” has “not only rules, but a point” (Wittgenstein, L. [1968], p. 150e). 
Wittgenstein was driving at a general principle: an object is defined, even 
perceived (categorized as a unity, rather than a multiplicity), with regard to its 
utility as a means to a given end. hi a basic sense, an object is a tool or an obstacle. 
What we perceive as objects are phenomena that may be easily utilized (to grant 
our desires)—at least in principle (or things that may well interfere with our 
attainment of desired ends). Facilitators are valenced, positively (as incentive 
rewards); obstacles, negatively (as punishments or threats). Normal facilitators and 
obstacles have minor valence, relatively speaking; their revolutionary counterparts 
may produce overwhelming emotion (think of Archimedes’ “Eureka!”). What can 
reasonably be parsed out of the environmental flux as an object is therefore 
determined in large part by the goal we have in mind while interacting with that 
flux. This complex situation is further complicated by the fact that the valence of 
objects, once given as objects, may still change with alteration in the ends we are 
pursuing (because tools in one situation may easily become obstacles—or 
something irrelevant—in another). Finally, many things that could manifest 
themselves as objects, at a given time or place, will not (because they are 
apparently irrelevant to the task at hand, and remain invisible).

167. Squire and Zola-Morgan state: 

The term declarative, which we have used, captures the notion 
that one kind of memory can be “declared”; it can be brought to 
mind explicitly, as a proposition or image. The capacity for 
declarative memory may be a relatively recent feat of evolution, 
appearing early in the vertebrates with the development of the 
hippocampus, and the capacity for declarative memory may be 
ontogenetically delayed. Procedural knowledge, by contrast, can 
be expressed only through performance, and the contents of this 
knowledge are not accessible to awareness. Procedural knowledge 
is considered to be phylogenetically primitive and ontogenetically 
early.... We agree with Tulving and his colleagues that the 
episodic-semantic distinction, which has something interesting to 
say about the structure of normal memory, is a subset of 
declarative (prepositional) memory. (Squire, L.R. & Zola- 
Morgan, S. [1990], p. 138.). 

My presupposition is that a story is a semantic representation of an 
episodic representation of the outputs of the procedural system: a verbal 
description of an image of behavior (and the consequences of that 
behavior).

177. An idea is (in part) an abstracted action, whose consequences can be analyzed in 
abstracted fantasy. The distance between the idea and the action has widened 
within the course of recent evolutionary history. Medieval people, unused to 
rhetorical speech, were easily seized emotionally or inspired to action by pas¬ 
sionate words (see Huizinga, J. [1967]). hi the modern world, flooded by 
meaningless speech, words have lost much of their immediate procedural power, 
under normal conditions. However, music still unconsciously compels movement, 
dance or, at least, the compulsion to keep the beat. Even chimpanzees seem 
capable of becoming possessed by simple rhythms (see Campbell, J. [1987], pp. 
358-359). hi addition, modem individuals are still easily seized and motivated by 
drama, like that portrayed in motion pictures—much like the “primitive” seized by 
ritual—and can easily lose themselves in the act of acting “as if’ the drama is 
actually happening, hi the absence of this seizure, which is meaningful, drama 
loses its interest. Rhetoric—the call to action—also still dominates advertising, 
with evident effect. 

178. “Meaningful” drama, or meaningful information, per se, has that characteristic 
because it produces affect, indicative of occurrence outside of predictability, and 
because it implies something for alteration of behavior. The phenomenon of 
meaning occurs when information can be translated from one “level” of memory to 
another, or to all others.

ancient days, in the generations of old. Art thou not it that hath cut Rahab, and 
wounded the dragon?” Psalm 74 contains several comparable passages (14-17): 

Thou brakest the heads of leviathan in pieces, and gavest him to 
be meat to the people inhabiting 

the wilderness. Thou didst cleave the fountain and the flood: thou 
driedst up mighty rivers. The day is thine, the night also is thine: 
thou hast prepared the light and the sun. Thou hast set all the 
borders of the earth: thou hast made summer and winter.

293. There is good evidence for actual independence of subpersonalities in the human 
imagination (in the episodic and procedural memory systems [?]), and 
incontrovertible evidence for the use of metaphoric personality in ritual, art and 
literature. There are many forms of normal experience that involve the explicit 
participation of “foreign” personalities, or partial personalities. These include 
dreams, in which characters appear within experience in known and unknown 
guise, and follow what are apparently their own intrinsic and often 
incomprehensible laws of behavior (see Jung, C.G. [1968b] for an analysis of an 
extensive series of dreams [the physicist Wolfgang Pauli’s, as it happens]). 

Moods, arriving upon the stage of consciousness, influence perception, memory, 
cognition and behavior, producing perplexing outbursts of sadness and rage on the 
part of the person who is so influenced (Jung identified the “anima,” the archetype 
of the feminine, with mood [see Jung, C.G. (1968a), p. 70]). “Active imagination” 
(see Jung, C.G. [1968a], p. 190), a process that might be compared to purposive 
daydreaming—with mood as the focus—can generate images and fantasies 
associated with that mood. Participation in this process helps illuminate the 
structure of the “personalities” associated with given states of emotional seizure. 

In states of abnormal tension and in psychopathological or neurological breakdown 
the effects of foreign personalities are easily observable. Individuals afflicted with 
Tourette’s syndrome appear “possessed” by a complex spirit, for want of a better 
description, whose personality uncannily matches that of the Trickster of the North 
American Indian (see Sacks, O. [1987]; Jung, C.G. [1968a], pp. 255-274). 
Schizophrenic breakdown involves the apparent participation of many fragmented 
personalities who make their appearance in voices and urges “foreign” to the 
assaulted mind of the psychotic (see Jung, C.G. [1967a]; Romme, M.A. & Escher, 
A.D. [1989]). The physiologist and schizophrenia researcher Doty states: 

Among the more widely recognized diagnostic criteria are the 
“first rank” symptoms identified by Kurt Schneider. As 
summarized by Crow and Johnstone, these are: “(1) hearing one’s 
thoughts spoken aloud within one’s head, (2) hearing voices 
arguing, (3) hearing voices that comment upon what one is doing, 

(4) experiences of bodily influence (that bodily functions are 
affected by an outside agency), (5) experiences that one’s 
thoughts are being withdrawn from or inserted into one’s head, 

(6) thought diffusion or the experience that one’s thoughts are 
broadcast to others, (7) delusional perception (the attribution of 
special significance to a particular perception), and (8) feelings or 
volitions experienced as imposed on the patients by others.” This 
list of first rank schizophrenic symptoms is uniquely fascinating 
in the present context, for, as Nasrallah astutely phrases it, they 
can all be summarized by the basic idea “that in the schizophrenic 
brain the unintegrated right-hemisphere consciousness may 
become an ‘alien intruder’ on the verbally expressive left 
hemisphere.” In other words, they are prototypical of what one 
might expect were interhemispheric communication so distorted 
that the left hemisphere could no longer identify the origin of 
activities in the right hemisphere as belonging to the unified 
consciousness of self. (Doty, R.W. [1989], p. 3). 

Cleghorn has reported that schizophrenics experiencing auditory 



Notes 499 


hallucinations were characterized by increased glucose uptake (assessed 
with positron-emission tomography [PET] scan) in regions of the right 
hemisphere, corresponding to the language areas of the left hemisphere 
(Cleghorn, J.M. [1988]). Doty suggests that these right-hemisphere 
structures may have been released from tonic inhibition by the dominant 
left-hemisphere language center, in the course of the schizophrenic 
breakdown (Doty, R.W. [1989]). 

Multiple personality disorder, a historically cycling condition (see Ellenberger, 
H.F. [1970]), emerges when “personalities” and representations thereof, external to 
the central ego, appear without union of memory, often in those with dissociative 
tendencies who were punished severely and arbitrarily early in life. 
Obsessive-compulsive disorder reduces its victims to total domination by an object 
of experience or a thought, producing behavioral and cognitive patterns foreign to 
those afflicted (and to those concerned with the afflicted) (Rapoport, J. [1989]). 
Shamanic and religious rituals, primitive initiation rites and psychoactive 
chemicals produce complex physiological changes within the individual brain, 
activating affectively based complexes that could not otherwise reach 
consciousness, producing insights and affects not otherwise attainable, with oft- 
dramatic consequences. (It is of interest to note, in this regard, that LSD and other 
psychotomimetic or hallucinogenic drugs are characterized by their effect on the 
phylogenetically ancient serotonergic brain-stem projections [see Doty, R.W. 
(1989)].) 

Epileptic seizures, often accompanied by strange perceptual, emotional and 
cognitive changes, run the gamut from awe-inspiring and holy to demonic and 
terrifying (see Ervin, F. & Smith, M. [1986]). The discussion presented in this 
chapter is particularly interesting, insofar as it describes pathological alterations, 
not of systematic cognition, but of meaning. Ervin describes cases where epileptic 
patients refuse pharmacological treatment, risking their physiological and 
psychological well-being, because they are unwilling to forgo the pre-epileptic 
“aura”—a condition of altered experience, preceding the epileptic seizure per se. 
This “aura” may partake of the quality of revelation—producing apparently 
profound subjective insight into the deepest meaning of the universe, for example 
(although it is more commonly associated with extreme terror). Before such states 
are packaged as pathological, necessarily delusional, it should be remembered that 
Dostoyevski was epileptic, altered, and perhaps deepened in psychological insight 
by the processes of his illness. Such seizures can also induce violent outbursts, 
completely dissociated from the individual’s normal behavioral state (see Mark, 
V.H. & Ervin, F.R. [1970]).

p. 458). Contents in memory with the same affective valence tend to group. This 
phenomena has long been recognized in the case of depression. Depressed people 
are characterized by a bias toward the perception, remembrance and conception of 
punishments: disappointment, frustration (absences of expected rewards), 
loneliness and pain (see Beck, A. [1979]).

307. It is my understanding that this progression has not been demonstrated, and that the 
“patriarchal” deities stand in a secondary “psychological,” rather than historical, 
relationship to the matriarchal deities (as “things derived from the matrix”). 
Furthermore, as we have discussed, the “unknown” can also be regarded as 
“derived” from the “known” (as “things defined in opposition to the known”). For 
the purposes of this book, however, the precise temporal/historical relationship of 
the various deities to one another is of secondary importance, compared to the fact 
and meaning of their existence as eternal “categories” of imagination.

309. See Bowlby, J. (1969). Bowlby investigated the curious fact that a substantial 
proportion of orphaned or otherwise isolated babies, provided with adequate food, 
basic physical care and shelter, still “failed to thrive” and died. More recent 
research has been devoted toward investigation of the processes underlying social 
attachment in general, and maternal attachment in particular, and has focused in 
part on the role of the opiate system, which is also involved in governing reaction 
to pain, frustration and disappointment—broadly, to punishment (reviewed in Pihl, 
R.O. & Peterson, J.B. [1992]).

314. A similar—and illuminating—conflation of source with attitude also characterizes 
Christ’s terminology with regard to himself. He is to be regarded both as model for 
subjective stance (I am the way, the truth, and the life [John 14:6]), but also as 
source of the “water of life” (If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink. 
He that believeth on me, as the scripture hath said, out of his belly shall flow rivers 
of living water [John 7:37-38]).

350. Frye states, in keeping with this theme: 

There is one theme that recurs frequently in the early books of the 
Bible: the passing over of the firstborn son, who normally has the 
legal right of primogeniture, in favor of a young one. The 
firstborn son of Adam, Cain, is sent into exile, and the line of 
descent goes through Seth. Ham, the rejected son of Noah, is not 
said to be his eldest son, but the same pattern recurs. Abraham is 
told to reject his son Ishmael because a younger son (Isaac) is to 



Notes 502 


be bom to him. Isaac’s eldest son Esau loses his birthright to 
Jacob through some rather dubious maneuvers on Jacob’s part, 
some of them backed by his mother. Jacob’s eldest son Reuben 
loses his inheritance for the reason given in Genesis 49:4. 

Joseph’s younger son Ephraim takes precedence over the elder 
Manasseh. The same theme is extended, though not essentially 
changed, in the story of the founding of the monarchy, where the 
first chosen king, Saul, is rejected and his line passed over in 
favor of David, who is practically his adopted son (I Samuel 
18:2). hi later literature the theme is carried much farther back: if 
we look at the fifth book of Paradise Lost, for instance, we see an 
archetype of the jealousy of an older son, Lucifer or Satan, at the 
preference shown to the younger Christ. (Frye, N. [1982], pp.

372. This is the mythic theme of Dostoyevsky’s Crime and Punishment (1993). Raskolnikov, 
Dostoyevsky’s “revolutionary” socialist protagonist, places himself above God (somewhat in 
the manner of Nietzsche’s superman), and resolves to commit a crime (murder) justified 
elaborately and carefully by recourse to demythologized rationality. The crime succeeds, but 
Raskolnikov is unable to bear its burden, and confesses, as a consequence of intrapsychic 
compulsion (in the absence of objective necessity). In consequence, he is able to regain his 
(protective) identity with the common community. 

This theme has been revisited, in recent years, by Woody Allen, a great admirer of Russian 
literature, in his motion picture Crimes and Misdemeanors (1989). Allen’s protagonist, a 
respected physician, murders his mistress to prevent her from disrupting his family’s (false) 
security. Unlike Raskolnikov, however, the good physician suffers no long-term psychic 
trauma, and everything “returns to normal” within the year. The movie, placid on the surface, 
is more horrifying than Dostoyevsky’s tortured book, hi the latter, moral order (predicated on 
respect for the intrinsic value of the individual) rules, in contrast to presumptuous rationality, 
hi the former, rational meaninglessness prevails absolutely—although it remains thinly veiled 
by urban pleasantry and pretence.

386. For elaborated description, see Jung, C.G. (1967a); Neumann, E. (1954). Jung states: “The 
purpose of the descent as universally exemplified in the myth of the hero is to show that only 
in the region of danger (watery abyss, cavern, forest, island, castle, etc.) can one find the 
“treasure hard to attain” (jewel, virgin, life-potion, victory over death.”) (Jung, C.G. [1968b], 
p. 335). 

387. Nietzsche states: “The unhistorical is like the surrounding atmosphere that can alone create 
life and in whose annihilation life itself disappears. It is true that man can only become man 
by first suppressing this unhistorical element in his thoughts, comparisons, distinctions, and 
conclusions, letting a clear sudden light break through these misty clouds by his power of 
turning the past to the uses of the present. But an excess of history makes him flag again.”

408. Another relevant Nietzschean comment: 

The structure of the scenes and the visual images reveal a deeper wisdom 
than the [ancient Greek poets themselves could] put into words and 
concepts: the same is also observable in Shakespeare, whose Hamlet, for 
instance, similarly, talks more superficially than he acts, so that the 
previously mentioned lesson of Hamlet is to be deduced, not from his words, 
but from a profound contemplation and survey of the whole. (Nietzsche, F.

431. When I first began the process that led me to understand these ideas, I painted a 
frightening picture of the crucified Christ, “glaring, judgmental, demonic, with a cobra 
wrapped around his naked waist, like a belt” (as described in the Preface). I was struggling 
with problems of identity, in an world that had apparently gone insane. The image of the 
exploratory hero manifested itself to me in imagistic representation, contaminated with the 
figure of the Dragon of Chaos—“and as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even 
so must the Son of man be lifted up” (John 3:14). This contamination might be regarded as 
indicative of the danger the development of full understanding of that hero and the “world” 
he inhabited posed to my then-extant personality structure (which in fact dissolved and 
regenerated, over a lengthy period, thereafter). The “identity” of the revolutionary hero with 
the serpent of chaos, however, accounts for the hatred and fear his necessary actions produce 
among the population he is striving to help.

439. Frye states: 

A descent into a world below consciousness involves some break in the 
continuity of conscious memory, or some annihilation of the previous 
conditions of existence, corresponding to falling asleep. The lower world is 
often a world of greatly enlarged time, where a few moments may 
correspond to many years in the upper world. (Frye, N. [1990], p. 266). 

This is reminiscent of Jung’s notion that time is relativized in the collective 
unconscious.

443. Nietzsche generated a hypothesis that seems relevant: 

Suppose nothing else were “given” as real except our world of desires and 
passions, and we could not get down, or up, to any other “reality” besides 
the reality of our drives—for thinking is merely a relation of these drives to 
each other: is it not permitted to make the experiment and to ask the 
question whether this “given” would not be sufficient for also understanding 
on the basis of this kind of thing the so-called mechanistic or (“material”) 
world? I mean, not as a deception, as “mere appearance,” and “idea” (in the 



Notes 506 


sense of Berkeley and Schopenhauer) but as holding the same rank of reality 
as our affect—as a more primitive form of the world of affects in which 
everything still lies contained in a powerful unity before it undergoes 
ramifications and developments in the organic process (and, as is only fair, 
also becomes tenderer and weaker)—as a kind of instinctive life in which all 
organic functions are still synthetically intertwined along with self- 
regulation, assimilation, nourishment, excretion, and metabolism—as a 
preform of life. (Nietzsche, F. [1966], pp. 47—48).

458. Frye elaborates on the myth of Narcissus: 

The beautiful youth paralyzed by the mirror-reflection of himself and hence 
unable to love. Mythologists very early made Narcissus a type of the fall of 
Adam, as Adam, like Narcissus, identified himself with his own parody- 
reflection in a lower world. Paul’s conception of Christ as the second Adam 
makes Christ the double of the Narcissus-Adam who delivers the original 
one from what Lacan calls the stade de miroir and Eliot a wilderness of 
mirrors. (Frye, N. [1990], p. 271). 

Consider Nietzsche’s statement: 

459. 

On his way to becoming an “angel” (to employ no uglier word) man has 
evolved that queasy stomach and coated tongue through which not only the 
joy and innocence of the animal but life itself has become repugnant to 
him—so that he sometimes holds his nose in his own presence, and, with 
Pope Innocent the Third, disapprovingly catalogues his own repellent 
aspects (“impure begetting, disgusting means of nutrition in his mother’s 
womb, baseness of the matter out of which man evolves, hideous stink, 
secretion of saliva, urine, and filth”). (Nietzsche, F. [1967b], p. 67). 

The human neocortex developed at an unprecedented rate, from the evolutionary standpoint. 

460. This expansion and the extension of consciousness to the self were synchronous phenomena. 



Notes 507 


One factor limiting this expansion, which increases head size dramatically, is the diameter of 
the female pelvic girdle, which must allow the infant passage during birth. The frequently 
traumatic nature of human birth is a consequence, at least in part, of the conflict between 
neonate cranial circumference and maternal pelvic structure.

537. Frye states, with regard to the role of criticism in illuminating narrative meanings: 



Notes 509 


The poetic imagination constructs a cosmos of its own, a cosmos to be 
studied not simply as a map but as a world of powerful conflicting forces. 

This imaginative cosmos is neither the objective environment studied by 
natural science nor a subjective inner space to be studied by psychology. It 
is an intermediate world in which the images of higher and lower, the 
categories of beauty and ugliness, the feelings of love and hatred, the 
associations of sense experience, can be expressed only by metaphor and yet 
cannot be dismissed or reduced to projections of something else. Ordinary 
consciousness is so possessed by the either-or contrast of subject and object 
that it finds difficulty in taking in the notion of an order of words that is 
neither subjective nor objective, though it interpenetrates with both. But its 
presence gives a very different appearance to many elements of human life, 
including religion, which depend on metaphor but do not become less “real” 
or “true” by doing so. 

Of course “metaphorical” is as treacherous a conception as “truth” or 
“reality” could ever be. Some metaphors are illuminating; some are merely 
indispensable; some are misleading or lead only to illusion; some are 
socially dangerous. Wallace Stevens speaks of “the metaphor that murders 
metaphor.” But for better or worse it occupies a central area—perhaps the 
central area—of both social and individual experience. It is a primitive form 
of awareness, established long before the distinction of subject and object 
became normal, but when we try to outgrow it we find that all we can really 
do is rehabilitate it. 

At this point another recent critical observation comes to hand, from Italo 
Calvino’s posthumous Norton lectures, also a paradox, but an exhilarating 
one: “Literature remains alive only if we set ourselves immeasurable goals, 
far beyond any hope of achievement.” Strictly speaking the writer does not 
set the goals: these are set by the shaping spirit of literature itself, the source 
of a writer’s ability to write. But in general the same principal should apply 
to criticism, when the critic sees in the far distance some such axiom as 
“Criticism can and should make sense of literature,” and refuses to settle for 
anything less. 

(Frye, N. [1990], pp. xxii-xxiii). 

The attempts by the pharaoh to control the Jewish “threat” through means of infanticide 

538. provides a (noncoincidental) narrative parallel to the actions of Herod, who killed all the 
Jewish children under two in Bethlehem and environs, for similar reasons, many centuries 
later (see Matthew 2:1-16). 

539. Frye continues: 

And yet Canaan seems a rather shrunken and anticlimactic form of the 
paradisal land of promise flowing with milk and honey that was originally 
promised to Israel. Perhaps Moses was really the only person to see the 
Promised Land: perhaps the mountain outside it he climbed in his last hours 
was the only place from which it could be seen. (Frye, N. [1990], p. 299).

541. The Hebrews feed on manna during their desert sojourn. Such “spiritual bread”—made, in its 
profane condition, from wheat, the metaphorical body of eternally dying and resurrecting 



Notes 510 


com god—is later offered by and equated with Christ, to aid, ritually (procedurally), in the 
incorporation of heroic faith and courage. Frye states: 

Christ is constantly associated with the miraculous provision of food. 
Miracles of feeding large multitudes with very small amounts of food (fish, 
as contents drawn up from the [unconscious, maternal] deep, as well as 
bread) are recorded in all four Gospels, sometimes more than once, and such 
miracles are explicitly antitypes of the provision of manna in the wilderness 
(John 6:49-51). The imagery of eating Christ’s flesh and drinking his blood 
meets us in the Gospels even before the institution of the Eucharist. That 
Christ’s body is an unfailing source of food and drink is asserted on both 
physical and spiritual levels (the “daily {epiousion} bread” of the Lord’s 
Prayer might also be regarded as “supersubstantial” bread). The body of 
Christ is not only “to be eaten, to be divided, to be chunk,” in the words of 
Eliot’s “Gerontion,” but is the source of the continuity of the life of his 
people, hidden within their bodies. It was so in Old Testament times too, 
according to Paul, who says that the Israelites in the wilderness all ate the 
same spiritual food and drank the same spiritual drink, the latter from a rock 
which was Christ (I Corinthians 10:3). (Frye, N. [1990], p. 257). 

Reference to mythic narrative as source for explicit rule is explicitly presented here. 

542. 

543. Frye states: 

I have noted (Great Code 18) the passage in Faust where Faust deliberately 
alters “In the beginning was the Word” to “hi the beginning was the Act.” I 
should have added that Faust was simply following the established Christian 
practice up to his time, hi the beginning God did something, and words are 
descriptive servomechanisms telling us what he did. This imports into 
Western religion what post-structural critics call the “transcendental 
signified,” the view that what is true or real is something outside the words 
that the words are pointing to. (Frye, N. [1990], p. 34). 

Frye states: 

544. 

If it is true that creative verbal power is associated with something in the 
mind supplementary to ordinary consciousness, we have inched a little 
closer to the writer’s social context. Such a mind would often be baffled by 
the arbitrary conventions of behavior that consciousness more easily 
masters: one often finds a naivete in the writer that may sometimes 
incapacitate him from almost anything except writing. But he might have in 
compensation an insight into social phenomena that would give him, not 
merely an intense vision of the present, but an unusual ability to see a 
conditional future, the consequence of tendencies in the present. This in turn 
may give the sense of a distinctive kind of knowledge hidden from 

most of society. The element of the prophetic in literature is often spoken of 
very vaguely, but is tangible enough to be worth looking into, hi any case, 
the word comes closer to anything we have stumbled over so far to indicate 
the quality of the poet’s authority, and to indicate also the link between 
secular and sacred literature that is one of our main themes. 

If we look at the prophetic writers of the Old Testament, beginning with 



Notes 511 


Amos, the affiliation of primitive and prophetic emerges at once. Amos has 
the refusal to compromise with polite conventions, a social reputation in 
northern Israel for being a fool and a madman, and an ability to derive the 
substance of what he says from unusual mental states, often allied to trance. 

Such prophets also foretell a future which is an inevitable result of certain 
foolish policies, like the policy of the king of Judah toward Babylon that led, 
as Jeremiah told him it would, to the destruction of Jerusalem. The principle 
involved here is that honest social criticism, like honest science, extends the 
range of predictability in society. 

hi modern times the writers that we instinctively call prophetic—Blake, 
Dostoevsky, Rimbaud—show similar features. Such writers are as deeply 
pondered by readers as the Greek and Hebrew oracles were: like them, they 
shock and disturb; like them, they may be full of contradictions and 
ambiguities, yet they retain a curiously haunting authority. As early as 
Elizabethan times there were critics who suggested that the distinction 
between sacred and secular inspiration might be less rigid than generally 
assumed. George Puttenham, writing in the 1580s, pointed to the etymology 
of poet as “maker,” which implied for him an analogy between the poet’s 
creative power and the creative power of God in making the world. He 
quotes Ovid’s phrase in the Fasti, ‘est deus in nobis,’ which would mean 
either God or a god. hi the sixteenth century it would certainly have been 
safer to settle for a Muse or a God of Love or something sanctioned by 
convention and not taken seriously as doctrine, but the analogy is still there, 
though latent until the time of Coleridge. It has been frequently observed 
that the arts are prophetic also in the sense of indicating symbolically the 
social trends that become obvious several generations later. 

The term prophetic in itself might apply to some writers (Luther, Condorcet, 

Marx) whom we normally would place outside literature. This troublesome 
apparatus of inside and outside will not go away even when so many aspects 
of it vanish under examination. It appears to be the connection with the 
psychologically primitive that characterizes the prophetic writer who is 
generally thought of as inside literature or at least (as with Rousseau, 
Kierkegaard, or Nietzsche) impossible to ignore as a literary figure. (Frye, 

N. [1990], pp. 52-54).

556. Frye also states: 


We referred earlier to the structure of the Book of Judges, in which a series 



Notes 512 


of stories of traditional tribal heroes is set within a repeating mythos of the 
apostasy and restoration of Israel. This gives us a narrative structure that is 
roughly U-shaped, the apostasy being followed by a descent into disaster 
and bondage, which in turn is followed by repentance, then by a rise through 
deliverance to a point more or less on the level from which the descent 
began. This U-shaped pattern, approximate as it is, recurs in literature as the 
standard shape of comedy, where a series of misfortunes and 
misunderstandings brings 

the action to a threateningly low point, after which some fortunate twist in 
the plot sends the conclusion up to a happy ending. The entire Bible, viewed 
as a “divine comedy,” is contained within a U-shaped story of this sort, one 
in which man, as explained, loses the tree and water of life at the beginning 
of Genesis and gets them back at the end of Revelation, hi between, the 
story of Israel is told as a series of declines into the power of heathen 
kingdoms, Egypt, Philistia, Syria, Rome, each followed by a rise into a brief 
moment of independence. The same U-narrative is found outside the 
historical sections also, in the account of the disasters and restoration of Job 
and in Jesus’ parable of the prodigal son. This last, incidentally, is the only 
version in which the redemption takes place as the result of a voluntary 
decision on the part of the protagonist (Luke 15:18). 

It would be confusing to summarize all the falls and rises of the Biblical 
history at once, hi honor of the days of creation, let us select six, with a 
seventh forming the end of time. The first fall, naturally, is that of Adam 
from Eden, where Adam goes into a wilderness that modulates to the 
heathen cities founded by the family of Cain. Passing over the story of 
Noah, which adds the sea to the images of disaster, the first rise is that of 
Abraham, called out of the city of Ur in Mesopotamia to a Promised Land in 
the west. This introduces the pastoral era of the patriarchs, and ends at the 
end of Genesis, with Israel in Egypt. This situation again changes to an 
oppressive and threatening servitude; Israel again passes through a sea and a 
wilderness, and under Moses and Joshua reaches its promised land again, a 
smaller territory where the main images are agricultural. There succeed the 
invaders in the Book of Judges, of whom the most formidable were the 
Philistines, probably a Greek-speaking people from Crete (if that is the 
“Caphtor” of Amos 9:7) who gave their name to Palestine. They held the 
mastery of Israel after the defeat and death of Saul and his son Jonathan. 
The third rise begins with David and continues with Solomon, where the 
imagery is urban, concerned with cities and buildings. After Solomon, 
however, another disaster begins with the splitting of the kingdom. The 
northern kingdom was destroyed by Assyria in 722 B.C.; the southern 
kingdom of Judah had a reprieve until after Assyria was destroyed in its turn 
(Nahum 2:3ff); but with the capture of Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar in 
586 the Babylonian captivity began. 

The fourth rise in the fortunes of the Israelites, now the Jews, begins with 
the permission—perhaps the encouragement—given the Jewish captives in 
Babylon by Cyrus of Persia to return and rebuild their temple. Two returns 
are prominently featured in the Old Testament, and there were probably 
more, but symbolically we need only one. Some flickering hopes of a 
restored Israel clustered around the chief figure of the first return, 
Zerubbabel of the line of David. After several changes of masters, the next 



Notes 513 


dramatic descent was caused by the savage persecution of the non- 
Hellenized Jews by Antiochus Epiphanes of the Seleucian empire, which 
provoked the rebellion of the Maccabees, five brothers of a priestly family 
who finally gained independence for Judea and established a royal dynasty. 
This lasted until the Roman legions under Pompey rolled over the country in 
63 B.C., and began the Roman domination that lasts throughout the New 
Testament period. At this point Jewish and Christian views of the sixth 
deliverance of Israel diverge. For Christianity, Jesus achieved a definitive 
deliverance for all mankind with his revelation that the ideal kingdom of 
Israel was a spiritual kingdom. For Judaism, the expulsion from their 
homeland by the edict of Hadrian in 135 A.D. began a renewed exile which 
in many respects still endures. 

This is a sequence of mythoi, only indirectly of historical events, and our 
first step is to realize that all the high points and all the low points are 
metaphorically related to one another. That is, the garden of Eden, the 
Promised Land, Jerusalem, and Mount Zion are interchangeable synonyms 
for the home of the soul, and in Christian imagery they are identical, in their 
“spiritual” form (which we remember means metaphorically, whatever else 
it may mean) with the kingdom of God spoken of by Jesus. Similarly, Egypt, 
Babylon and Rome are all spiritually the same place, and the Pharaoh of the 
Exodus, Nebuchadnezzar, Antiochus Epiphanes, and Nero are spiritually the 
same person. And the deliverers of Israel—Abraham, Moses, and Joshua, 
the judges, David, and Solomon—are all prototypes of the Messiah or final 
deliverer.... As the various declines of Israel through apostasy and the like 
are not acts so much as failures to act, it is only the rises and restorations 
that are real events, and as the Exodus is 

the definitive deliverance and the type of all the rest, we may say that 
mythically the Exodus is the only thing that really happens in the Old 
Testament. On the same principle the resurrection of Christ, around which 
the New Testament revolves, must be, from the New Testament’s point of 
view, the antitype of the Exodus. The life of Christ as presented in the 
Gospels becomes less puzzling when we realize that it is being presented in 
this form. 

Like that of many gods and heroes, the birth of Jesus is a threatened birth: 
Herod orders a massacre of infants in Bethlehem from which Jesus alone 
escapes. Moses similarly escapes from an attempt to destroy Hebrew 
children, as they in turn escape later from a slaughter of Egyptian firstborn. 
The infant Jesus is taken down into Egypt by Joseph and Mary, and his 
return from there, Matthew (2:15) says, fulfills the prophecy of Hosea (11:1) 
“I called my son out of Egypt,” where the reference is quite explicitly to 
Israel. The names Mary and Joseph recall the Miriam who was the sister of 
Moses and the Joseph who led the family of Israel into Egypt. The third 
Sura of the Koran appears to be identifying Miriam and Mary; Christian 
commentators on the Koran naturally say this is ridiculous, but from the 
purely typological point of view from which the Koran is speaking, the 
identification makes good sense. 

Moses organizes the twelve tribes of Israel; Jesus gathers twelve disciples. 
Israel crosses the Red Sea and achieves its identity as a nation on the other 
side; Jesus is baptized in the Jordan and is recognized as the Son of God. 
The baptism is the point at which Mark and John begin, the infancy stories 



Notes 514 


of Matthew and Luke being probably later material. Israel wanders forty 
years in the wilderness; Jesus, forty days. Miraculous food is provided for 
Israel and by Jesus for those gathered around him (see John 6:49-50). The 
law is given from Mount Sinai and the gospel preached in the Sermon on the 
Mount. A brazen serpent is placed on a pole by Moses as preservation 
against the fatal bites of “fiery serpents” (Numbers 21:9); this brazen serpent 
was accepted by Jesus as a type of his crucifixion (John 3:14) with an 
underlying association between the lethal serpents and the serpent of Eden. 

Moses dies just outside the Promised Land, which in Christian typology 
signifies the inability of the law alone to redeem man, and the Promised 
Land is conquered by Joshua. The hidden link here is that Jesus and Joshua 
are the same word, hence when the Virgin Mary is told to call her child 
Jesus or Joshua, the typological meaning is that the reign of the law is over, 
and the assault on the Promised Land has begun (Matthew 1:21). (Frye, N. 

[1982], pp. 169-172).

560. It is not merely the Gnostic Gospels that lay stress on the psychological nature of the 
Kingdom of God: 

And when he was demanded of the Pharisees, when the kingdom of God 
should come, he answered them and said, The kingdom of God cometh not 
with observation: 

Neither shall they say Lo here! or lo there! for, behold, the kingdom of God 
is within you. (Luke 17:20-21). 

Referring to Exodus 31:12-15: 

561. 

And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, 

Speak thou also unto the children of Israel, saying, Verily my sabbaths ye 
shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations: 
that ye may know that I am the Lord that doth sanctify you. 

Ye shall keep the sabbath therefore: for it is holy unto you: every one that 
defileth it shall surely be put to death: for whosoever doeth any work 
therein, that soul shall be cut off from among his people. 

Six days may work be done; but in the seventh is the sabbath of rest, holy to 
the Lord: whosoever doeth any work in the sabbath day, he shall surely be 
put to death. 

There is an apocryphal insertion at Luke 6:4. The insertion reads “Man, if indeed thou 

562. knowest what thou doest, thou art blessed; but if thou knowest not, thou art cursed, and a 
transgressor of the law” (Codex Bezae ad Lucam [to Luke] 6:4). More information is 
available in James M.R. (1924). Jung notes that the moral of this story is analagous to that in 
the parable of the unjust steward: 


It is the task of the Paraclete, the “spirit of truth,” to dwell and work in 
individual human beings, so as to remind them of Christ’s teachings and 
lead them into the light. A good example of this activity is Paul, who knew 



Notes 515 


not the Lord and received his gospel not from the apostles but through 
revelation. He is one of those people whose unconscious was disturbed and 
produced revelatory ecstasies. The life of the Holy Ghost reveals itself 
through its own activity, and through effects which not only confirm the 
things we all know, but go beyond them, hi Christ’s sayings there are 
already indications which go beyond the traditionally “Christian” morality— 
for instance the parable of the unjust steward (Luke 16:1-8), the moral of 
which agrees with the Logion of the Codex Bezae, and betrays an ethical 
standard very different from what is expected. Here the moral criterion is 
consciousness, and not law or convention. One might also mention the 
strange fact that it is precisely Peter, who lacks self-control and is fickle in 
character, whom Christ wishes to make the rock and foundation of his 
church. (Jung, C.G. [1969], pp. 433-444). 

Jung also makes reference to the Oxyrhynchus papyrus, which is “older than the 
first conception of the gospels” (Jung, C.G. [1969], p. 444): Christ says, “Wherever 
there are two they are not without God, and wherever there is one alone I say I am 
with him.” Jung notes that this is in contrast to the standard version: “For where two 
or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them” 
(Matthew 18:20). The latter part of the former statement is strikingly reminiscent of 
Kierkegaard’s notion: 

For a “crowd” is the untruth, hi a godly sense it is true, eternally, 
Christianly, as St. Paul says, that “only one attains the goal”—which is not 
meant in a comparative sense, for comparison takes others into account. It 
means that every man can be that one, God helping him therein—but only 
one attains the goal. And again this means that every man should be chary 
about having to do with “the others,” and essentially should talk only with 
God and with himself—for only one attains the goal. And again this means 
that man, or to be a man, is akin to deity, hi a worldly and temporal sense, it 
will be said by the man of bustle, sociability, and amicableness, “How 
unreasonable that only one attains the goal; for it is far more likely that 
many, by the strength of united effort, should attain the goal; and when we 
are many success is more certain and it is easier for each man severally.” 

True enough, it is far more likely, and it is true also with respect to all 
earthly and material goods. If it is allowed to have its way, this becomes the 
only true point of view, for it does away with God and eternity and with 
man’s kinship with deity. It does away with it or transforms it into a fable, 
and puts in its place the modem (or, we might rather say, the old pagan) 
notion that to be a man is to belong to a race endowed with reason, to belong 
to it as a specimen, so that the race or species is higher than the individual, 
which is to say that there are no more individuals but only specimens. But 
eternity which arches over and high above the temporal, tranquil as the

571. Socrates’ comments on the internal oracle are of interest here. He states, in The Apology, 
after (voluntarily) accepting his sentence of death: 

And now, O men who have condemned me, I would fain prophesy to you; 
for I am about to die, and in the hour of death men are gifted with prophetic 
power. And I prophesy to you who are my murderers, that immediately after 
my departure punishment far heavier than you have inflicted on me will 
surely await you. Me you have killed because you wanted to escape the 
accuser, and not to give an account of your lives. But that will not be as you 
suppose: far otherwise. For I say that there will be more accusers of you 
than there are now; accusers whom hitherto I have restrained: and as they 
are younger they will be more inconsiderate with you, and you will be more 
offended at them. If you think that by killing men you can prevent some one 
from censuring your evil lives, you are mistaken; that is not a way of escape 
which is either possible or honourable; the easiest and the noblest way is not 
to be disabling others, but to be improving yourselves. This is the prophecy 
which I utter before my departure to the judges who have condemned me. 

Friends, who would have acquitted me, I would like also to talk with you 
about the thing which has come to pass, while the magistrates are busy, and 
before I go to the place at which I must die. Stay then a little, for we may as 
well talk with one another while there is time. You are my friends, and I 
should like to show you the meaning of this even which has happened to me. 

O my judges—for you I may truly call judges—I should like to tell you of a 
wonderful circumstance. Hitherto the divine faculty of which the internal 
oracle is the source has constantly been in the habit of opposing me even 
about trifles, if I was going to make a slip or error in any matter; and now 
you may see there has come upon me that which may be thought, and is 
generally believed to be, the last and worst evil. But the oracle made no sign 
of opposition, either when I was leaving my house in the morning, or when I 
was my way to the court, or while I was speaking, at anything which I was 
going to say; and yet I have often been stopped in the middle of a speech, 
but now in nothing I either said or did touching the matter in hand has the 
oracle opposed me. What do I take to be the explanation of this silence? I 
will tell you. It is an intimation that what has happened to me is a good, and 
that those of us who think that death is an evil are in error. For the 
customary sign would surely have opposed me had I been going to evil and 
not to good. (Plato, in Hutchins, R.M. [1952], pp. 210-211).

581. Eliade comments: “Even in the eighteenth century, the learned did not question the growth of 
minerals. They asked themselves, however, whether alchemy could assist nature in this 
process, and above all whether ‘those alchemists who claimed to have done so already were 
honest men, fools, or impostors’ (see Dobbs, B.J.T. [1975], p. 44). Elerman Boerhaave 
(1664-1739), considered the greatest ‘rationalist’ chemist of his time and famous for his 
strictly empirical experiments, still believed in the transmutation of metals. And we will see 
the importance of alchemy in the scientific revolution accomplished by Newton.” (Eliade, M.

600. At least two years after experiencing this dream (and a year or so after writing it down) I was 
reading Dante’s Inferno (Dante, A. [1982]). hi the ninth Canto, a messenger from God 
appears in hell to open the Gate of Dis, which is barring the divinely ordained way of Virgil 
and Dante. The approach of this messenger is preceded by a great storm, described in the 
following manner (p. 90): 

Suddenly there broke on the dirty swell 

of the dark marsh a squall of terrible sound 

that sent a tremor through both shores of Hell; 

a sound as if two continents of air, 

one frigid and one scorching, clashed head on 

in a war of winds that stripped the forests bare, 

ripped off whole boughs and blew them helter skelter 

along the range of dust it raised before it 

making the beasts and shepherds run for shelter. 

The similarity of imagery and meaning in my dream and this poem struck me as 
very interesting. 

601. This was actually an image I had used in therapeutic discussions, previously. I told my clients 
that an unresolved anomaly was like the tip of a monster’s tail: it looked harmless enough, 
viewed only as a tail—but that meant pretending that the part did not imply the whole.

619. Frye states: 

Prophet, high priest, and king are all figures of authority, but prophets are 
often martyred and even kings ...have scapegoat and victim imagery 
attached to them. Joshua was a type of Christ as the conqueror of the 
Promised Land: his enemies included five kings who were hung on trees and 
then buried in a cave with great stones rolled against it (Joshua 10:16ff.). 
Solomon, the king who succeeded David, is a type of Christ as a temple 
builder and wise teacher: Absalom, equally a son of David, rebelled against 
his father and was caught in a tree, traditionally by his golden hair, hanging 
there “between heaven and earth” until David’s general Joab came up and 
thrust darts into his side (II Samuel 18:14). Absalom’s curious helplessness 
in what seems a relatively easy situation to get out of suggests a ritual 
element in the story of his death. The writers of the Gospels found that in 
telling the story of Jesus they needed the imagery of the executed kings and 
Absalom quite as much as that of the figures of glory and triumph. (Frye, N. 

[1982], p. 180).

633. It seems possible that Piaget’s hypothetical “organ of equilibration” is equivalent to Jung’s 
“self’—the highest regulator of intrapsychic activity: 

The organism has special organs of equilibrium. The same is true of mental 
life, whose organs of equilibrium are special regulatory mechanisms. This is 
so at all levels of development, from the elementary regulators of motivation 
(needs and interests) up to will for affectivity and from perceptual and 
sensorimotor regulations up to operations for cognition. (Piaget, J. [1967], p. 

102 ). 



Notes 520 


Piaget also points out (a) that consciousness arises in personality “when the 
environmental situation in which some person finds himself or herself blocks some 
ongoing (goal-directed) activity. Children act in accordance with their needs and 
everything takes place without conscious awareness or the equilibrations going on 
until there is a frustration [Piaget’s terminology, likely equivalent to emergence of 
the unexpected (and punishing ?)].... Each of these frustrating circumstances serves 
to focus the child’s attention on the reasons for the dis-equilibration rather than 
simply on the desired goal” (Rychlak, J. [1981], p. 688—see Piaget, J. [1967]; 
Piaget, J. [1962]), and (b) that will arises when there is a conflict in behavioral 
tendencies (Jung would say, when there is a conflict in duty). Piaget believed that 
the will (the will to power; the heroic principle) could be considered the 
consequence of integration of affect and motivation: 

To the extent that the emotions become organized, they emerge as 
regulations whose final form of equilibrium is none other than the will. 

Thus, will is the true affective equivalent of the operation in reason. Will is a 
late-appearing function. The real exercise of will is linked to the function of 
the autonomous moral feelings, which is why we have waited until this 
[late-childhood] stage to discuss it. (Piaget, J. [1967], p. 58). 

This idea, in passing, is very much like Jung’s notion of the integration of feeling- 
toned complexes into the ego. Piaget elaborates, elsewhere: 


The act of will does not consist of following the inferior and stronger 
tendency; on the contrary, one would then speak of a failure of will or “lack 
of will power.” Will power involves reinforcing the superior but weaker 
tendency so as to make it triumph. (Piaget, J. [1965], p. 59).

662. There are (at least) two (major) alternative dogmatic formulations of Original Sin, in 
Christian tradition: (1) the source of eternal guilt; (2) the fortunate error, which leads to the 
incarnation of Christ. Toni Wolff notes: 

There are early medieval representations of the genealogical tree of Christ. 

On the branches, as the fruits of the tree, are the prophets and all Christ’s 
ancestors. The roots of the tree grow out of the skull of Adam, and Christ is 
its central and more precious fruit. 

Jung amplifies this comment: 

Well, the tree sometimes grows out of Adam’s navel, and on the branches, 
as you say, sit the prophets and kings of the Old Testament, Christ’s 
ancestors, and then on top of the tree is the triumphant Christ. That life 
begins with Adam and ends with Christ is the same idea. (Jung, C.G. [1988], 
p. 1440). 

Neumann states: 

663. 

Originally, Messianism was bound up with a historical process ending in the 
emergence of a savior who, after the transformation crisis of the apocalypse, 
ushers in the eschatological age of redemption. This conception can easily 
be shown to be a projection of an individuation process, the subject of 
which, however, is the people, the chosen collectivity, and not the 
individual. In the collective projection, history appears as the collective 
representation of destiny; the crisis is manifested in the projection of the 
ways which characterize the Last Days; and the transformation, as the Last 
Judgment, death and resurrection. Similarly, the transfiguration and 
conquest of the self corresponds to transfiguration in the celestial paradise 
which in the shape of a mandala gathers in mankind, or else it is projected as 
life in a re-created and renewed world governed by the king-Adam- 
anthropos -self at its center. (Neumann, E. 

[1968], p. 408).
